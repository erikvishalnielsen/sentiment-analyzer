        "content": "By Fanny Potkin and Heekyong Yang\n\nSINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' fourth-generation high bandwidth memory or HBM3 chips have been cleared by Nvidia for use in its processors for the first time, three people briefed on the matter said.\n\nBut it is somewhat of a muted greenlight as Samsung's HBM3 chips will, for now, only be used in a less sophisticated Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU), the H20, which has been developed for the Chinese market in compliance with U.S. export controls, the people said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Nvidia would use Samsung's HBM3 chips in its other AI processors or if the chips would have to pass additional tests before that could happen, they added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSamsung has also yet to meet Nvidia's standards for fifth-generation HBM3E chips and testing of those chips is continuing, the people added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nNvidia and Samsung declined to comment.\n\nHBM is a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. A key component of GPUs for artificial intelligence, it helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex applications.\n\nNvidia's approval of Samsung's HBM3 chips comes amid soaring demand for sophisticated GPUs created by the generative AI boom that Nvidia and other makers of AI chipsets are struggling to meet.\n\nThere are only three main manufacturers of HBM - SK Hynix, Micron and Samsung - and with HBM3 also in short supply, Nvidia is keen to see Samsung clear its standards so that it can diversify its supplier base.\n\nNvidia's need to have more access to HBM3 is also set to grow as SK Hynix - the clear leader in the field - plans to increase its HBM3E production and make less HBM3, two of the sources said.\n\nSK Hynix declined to comment.\n\nSamsung, the world's largest maker of memory chips, has been seeking to pass Nvidia's tests for both HBM3 and HBM3E since last year but has struggled due to heat and power consumption issues, Reuters reported in May, citing sources.\n\nStory continues\n\nSamsung said after the publication of the Reuters article in May that claims of failing Nvidia's tests due to heat and power consumption problems were untrue.\n\nH20\n\nSamsung could begin supplying HBM3 for Nvidia's H20 processor as early as August, according to two of the sources.\n\nThe H20 is the most advanced of three GPUs Nvidia has tailored for the China market after the U.S. tightened export restrictions in 2023, aiming to impede supercomputing and AI breakthroughs that could benefit the Chinese military.\n\nIn accordance with U.S. sanctions, the H20's computing power has been significantly capped compared to the version sold in non-China markets, the H100.\n\nThe H20 initially got off to a weak start when deliveries began this year and the U.S. firm priced it below a rival chip from Chinese tech giant Huawei, Reuters reported in May.\n\nBut sales are now growing rapidly, separate sources have said.\n\nIn contrast to Samsung, SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said.\n\nMicron has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E.\n\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Heekyong Yang in Seoul; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

        "title": "Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) the Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to find a mainstream AI ETF without NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its top holdings. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX)\u2019s second-biggest holding is Nvidia.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rapid run and soaring valuation have started to make some circles on Wall Street uneasy. New Street Research recently downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy and set the stock\u2019s price target at $135.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe downgrade the stock to Neutral today, as upside will only materialize in a bull case, in which the outlook beyond 2025 increases materially, and we do not have the conviction on this scenario playing out yet.\u201d New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu said.\n\nNYU professor and valuation guru Aswath Damodoran has also been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\n\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\n\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares have gained about 206% over the past year.\n\nRecently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn\u2019t immediately evident from\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (\u201cthe Index\u201d) and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\n\nOur Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious \u201cAI winner\u201d due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Broadcom To Challenge Nvidia Dominance? Analyst Says Jensen Huang-Led Chip Giant's Competitor Is 'Catching Up'\n\nIn a recent development, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is making significant strides in the AI stock market, posing a challenge to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nWhat Happened: The report, based on recent interactions with investors in New York and Connecticut, indicates that Broadcom\u2019s specialized AI business is gaining traction, Business Insider reported on Tuesday. The company has been assisting cloud giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in developing customized AI chips for internal use.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

This positions the tech giant for significant growth, both in the near term and long term.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s dominance in the $5-7 billion data center/AI Ethernet switching and routing chipset market, with a commanding 80% market share.

        "content": "TSMC's Latest Results Show It Is More Than A Beneficiary Of The AI Hype As It Is One Of One Its Creators\n\nLast Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) reported its second quarter results, surpassing both top and bottom-line estimates.\u00a0Surging demand for advanced chips used for developing gen-AI applications has boosted Taiwan listed shares of the world\u2019s leading producer of\u00a0advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, whose clients are the titans Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)\u00a0and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), among others, by almost 70%\u00a0year-to-date.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n\nFueled by its exclusive partnerships with Apple and Nvidia, TSMC reported net revenue grew 40.1% YoY to 673.51 billion\u00a0New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), surpassing LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of NT$657.58 billion.\n\nFor the June quarter,\u00a0net income grew 36.3% YoY to NT$247.85 billion which is about\u00a0$7.59 billion,\u00a0also surpassing LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of NT$238.8 billion.\n\nThird quarter guidance shows continued growth is expected.\n\nTSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion,\u00a0which would represent growth of about 30% to 33%.\n\n2024 is expected to be a strong growth year due to strong smartphone and AI-related demand. As for the annual capital budget, TSMC narrowed the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, while it previously guided for $28 billion to $32 billion. 70% to 80% of the budget will be allocated to advanced technologies.\n\nTSMC is not only benefiting from the AI hype, it is one of those helping to create it.\n\nTSMC\u2019s latest financial results and optimistic forecasts paint a picture of a leading company at the forefront of the AI revolution, together with Nvidia, which it counts among its clients.\u00a0Samsung Electronics and\u00a0Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTEL)\u00a0are trying to challenge its dominance. While TSMC has been the world\u2019s first chip contract maker for years and world\u2019s biggest foundry, its earnings have long been lagging those of Intel, but in 2023, its revenue surpassed those of both Intel and Samsung. It also leads in the operating profit arena. But Intel, who led the industry for decades, is determined to make a comeback and go beyond just fabrication and assembly with an ambitious foundry strategy. Foundry competition is heading up but for now, TSMC is still leading the way and it has the best partners, Apple and Nvidia, on its side.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC), unfortunately, entered correction territory after the Bitcoin halving event in April. However, BTC shrugged off the bearish trend and touched a 30-day high of $68,477.85 on Jul 22. Currently, BTC is priced above its support level of $67,000 and is well-positioned to surpass the $70,000 resistance level soon.\n\nAs of Jul 22, BTC long contracts were at $1.28 billion, way more than the short positions valued at $1.20 billion. Thus, with BTC\u2019s long contracts exceeding short contracts, its price is expected to enter a bullish trend and attract more buyers.\n\nWhat\u2019s Propelling Bitcoin Price Higher?\n\nThe continuing political events emerging in the United States proved beneficial for BTC. President Joe Biden opting to drop out from the presidential race, bolstered the chances of Donald Trump winning the election. Trump favors the crypto industry and has accepted donations in digital assets for his presidential campaigns.\n\nBy the way, there isn\u2019t any downward pressure on the BTC price as the German government has ended Bitcoin liquidations. On the other hand, the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has raised interest among prominent hedge fund managers, who are placing more bets on the flagship cryptocurrency than quintessential artificial intelligence stocks. For instance, Cathie Woods expects BTC to reach $3.8 million by 2030, more than her prediction of $1.5 million last year (read more: 2 Stocks in Cathie Wood's Portfolio to Watch Now).\n\nAdditionally, financial firms such as Millennium Management, Citadel Advisors and D.E. Shaw have already begun to take long-term positions in iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which is one of the recently accepted worthwhile spot Bitcoin ETF. IBIT\u2019s shares have already surged 15.3% over the past month. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, weakening economic conditions coupled with falling inflationary pressure raised hopes of an interest rate cut as early as the fall, which would undermine the dollar and increase interest in alternative assets such as BTC.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out, that BTC price doesn\u2019t increase after a Bitcoin halving event. Historically, BTC price has always gone up 12 to 18 months later, which means further upside is left and 2025 can be a promising year for the world\u2019s numero uno cryptocurrency. Have a look at the table: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSource: FidelityDigitalAssets\n\nBitcoin Bull Run is Here: NVDA, COIN, SQ to Benefit\n\nWith the price of BTC set to scale upward, things are looking encouraging for NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and Block, Inc. SQ.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA designs graphics processing units for mining cryptos such as Bitcoin. NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s current-year earnings has increased by 10.3% over the past 60 days. NVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.2%.\n\nCoinbase\n\nThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coinbase\u2019s next-year earnings has increased by 0.6% over the past 60 days. Coinbase\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 1,740.5%.\n\nBlock\n\nDigital payment company, Block, generates revenues from products like Cash App. In this platform, Bitcoin is purchased and sold.

        "content": "If You Invested $1000 In NVIDIA Stock 20 Years Ago, How Much Would You Have Now?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nNvidia\u2019s stock price surge over the last couple of years has been driven by soaring demand for its industry-leading AI chips. Consistent earnings beats for the last six quarters and growing investor interest in AI fuel Nvidia\u2019s impressive rally. Year-to-date, the stock is up around 148%. In 2023, the stock surged more than 230%.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its Q2 2025 earnings on Aug. 28, after the market closes. Wall Street analysts expect the AI giant to post an EPS of $0.59, up from $0.27 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $26.66 billion, up from $13.51 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market. This platform allows accredited investors to invest in commercial real estate, invest today for a 1% boost.\n\nIf You Bought NVIDIA Stock 20 Years Ago\n\nThe company's stock traded around $0.09 per share 20 years ago. If you had invested $1,000, you could have bought approximately 11,111 shares of NVIDIA stock. Currently, shares are trading at $123.43, which means your investment's value could have soared to $1,371,444 because of a significant stock price appreciation. But wait, the company also pays dividends, although small.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s dividend yield is currently 0.03%. Over the last twenty years, it paid around $0.15 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $1,667 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $1,371,444 and $1,667, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $1,373,111. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $1,000 in NVIDIA stock 20 years ago. This means a total return of 137,111%. The S&P 500 total return for the same period is 562.82%, while the Nasdaq composite total return is 894.88%.\n\nCheck it out: Rory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100.\n\nWhat Could The Next 20 Years Bring?\n\nNVIDIA has a consensus rating of Buy and a price target of $604.03 based on the ratings of 38 analysts. The price target implies a nearly 390% potential upside from the current stock price.\n\nAccording to our Benzinga Pro report, two analysts raised their price targets on NVIDIA. Loop Capital increased its target to $175 from $120, reiterating its Buy rating, while Piper Sandler raised the target to $140 from $120, maintaining its Overweight rating.\n\nOn May 22, NVIDIA announced its Q1 2025 earnings results. It generated a record quarterly revenue of $26.0 billion, representing a 262% year-over-year increase. Its data center revenue also hit a record of $22.6 billion, up 427% from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12 (this was before the ten-for-one forward stock split), up 461% from a year ago. Both EPS and revenue figures surpassed the consensus estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our data center growth was fueled by strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.\n\nThe company provided its guidance for Q2, expecting revenue of $28.0 billion, plus or minus 2%.\n\nIn summary, growth-focused investors may find NVIDIA stock attractive, given the recent stock price appreciation driven by the AI boom and the expected upside potential.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company\u2019s cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\n\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It\u2019s worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META\u2019s revenue.\n\nIn addition, META shares aren\u2019t expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company\u2019s outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\n\nNvidia Outlook Remains Robust\n\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\n\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\n\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks \u2013 Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\n\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\n\nNonetheless, these stocks\u2019 runs certainly aren\u2019t over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It's easy to feel overwhelmed with so many different investment options out there, but focusing on stocks that are set to outperform the market over the next 12 months is an excellent place to start.\n\nLet's now take a look at one standout stock that could be a perfect fit for your portfolio.\n\nWhy You Should Pay Attention to Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.\n\nOn May 20, 2019, NVDA was added to the Zacks Focus List at $3.91 per share.

        "title": "NVIDIA and CrowdStrike have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares NVIDIA NVDA as the Bull of the Day and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Amplify Energy Corp. AMPY, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. GLDD and LendingTree, Inc. TREE.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nI last looked at NVIDIA as the Bull of the Day after another stunning beat-and-raise quarter, reported on May 22, launched the stock from $95 ($950 pre-split) to my price target of $140 ($1,400 pre-split).\n\nWe knew the new Grace-Blackwell \"super-GPU\" was coming, but apparently investors and analysts needed to hear it from Jensen himself that the demand and deliveries were going to be off the charts by Q4.\n\nTectonic Shift to AI Economy\n\nThe other huge dynamic we learned on the conference call with Jensen on May 22 essentially put to rest the idea that \"cannibalization\" was about to occur as datacenter and LLM-builders would stop buying older systems like the GH200 because they wanted to wait for the GB200.\n\nHere's what I wrote to my investor group on May 23 as we sat back and enjoyed the rocket launch...\n\nTAZR Traders\n\nYou know the good news on NVDA: Wall Street continues to capitulate to the \"tectonic shift\" that has occurred with AI/ML/DL as more price targets play catch-up to our $1200...\n\nEven as I raise mine to $1400 for the next 18 months.\n\nAnd even as everyone and their Grandpa wring their hands about the NVDA market cap being worth more than half the world.\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter @KevinBCook you got to see the stunning \"chapter and verse\" from Jensen on the conference call yesterday... with all the analysts trying to find a fly in the ointment.\n\nI used Otter.AI to transcribe the whole thing and will share more over the coming days... what a sermon Master Huang delivered!\n\nIt made me coin a new phrase about how he abolished the fear of \"cannibalization\" during this Global 2,000 -- plus nation-states -- deployment transition from GH200 to GB200 systems...\n\n\"Multiplicative Integration.\"\n\nJensen didn't say this, but this is what I felt he was talking about. I actually posted his final 5-paragraph \"mic drop\" because it captured the essence of the technological transformation we are in for science, industry, medicine, education, and society.\n\nJensen & Co. systems have \"the transition\" covered with TCO (total cost of operations) fully seamless -- and bootstrapped -- on the upgrades to the Blackwell platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorporations won't have to worry about how the current GH200 systems integrate with the new Blackwell systems because Jensen and his top-tier CUDA engineers have already built that seamless transition into everything.\n\n(end of TAZR commentary excerpt from May 23)\n\nHuang's Law > Moore's Law\n\nThen in the first week of June came the annual Computex conference in Taiwan. And Jensen made it clear that the Acceleration of GPU computing was driving down nearly all Costs, including Energy usage, and providing powerful platforms for Science, Smart cities, and Simulation.\n\nThe oddly capitalized words in my previous sentence make up a new handy acronym I devised for technology investors to memorize when trying to understand the revolution that NVIDIA has birthed: ACESx3 is for Acceleration-Cost-Energy-Science-Smart-Simulation.\n\nThis is how I remember the power of NVIDIA, and the exponential reasons for staying invested in NVDA shares. And all of these letters stand for one of the most powerful ACESx3 innovations for human kind: advances in medicine and cures for our worst diseases.\n\nAfter Computex, and the NVDA 10-for-1 stock split which took effect on June 10, I raised my price target to $200. I had already told investors (and savvy traders) in May that the gap up from $95 ($950 pre-split) was likely never going to be filled (barring WWIII).\n\nHere was my commentary for Zacks TAZR members...\n\nNVDA to $200\r\nPosted on 6/10/24\n\nTAZR Traders\n\nThis morning we taped the Zacks Ultimate Strategy Session (ZUSS).\n\nMy Top Stock Pick was, of course, NVIDIA.\n\nAnd I tried to cram a lot (too much) into my 10-minute segment, but of course got lost along the way.\n\nI neglected to reiterate the emerging potential of Jensen's roadmap to $1 trillion in annual revenues by 2030 (a slide I showed you from last November).\n\nAnd then I forgot to speak this key statement from my weekend notes that sums up my \"No Cannibalization, Just Multiplicative Bootstrapping Integration\" (that I introduced last week during Computex)...\n\n\"ALL OLD and NEW DGX-GPU systems BENEFIT FROM CUDA SOFTWARE UPGRADES, SUCH THAT ALL PREVIOUS GENERATION CHIP-SETS ACTUALLY GET FASTER!\"\n\nThis is way beyond the \"backward compatibility\" thesis, so it gets lost on most analysts.\n\nThis is built-in \"acceleration multiplicity.\"\n\nTo say that the NVIDIA stack of enlightened software that extracts the most from the accelerated hardware is \"an exponential event-horizon for enterprise and science\" is the understatement of the decade.\n\nWe may not like what Meta, Google, and Amazon do with this massive data-power over society, but the genie is long out of the bottle.\n\nNow, we're aboard the ETI (Exponential Technology Innovation) Rocket that I previewed in 2017 in my Technology Super Cycle thesis.\n\nAnd as NVIDIA CUDA-DGX-GPU acceleration has surprised almost everyone to rival Apple and Microsoft valuations, it's also deliciously ironic that the \"Agree to Disagree\" topic for this month's ZUSS was...\n\n\"Ben Rains and Kevin Cook will Agree To Disagree on whether the U.S. National Debt matters to the U.S. economy and the market.\"\n\nWhen I last addressed this debate with some degree of interest, it was 3 years ago here...\n\nWhy the National Debt is Irrelevant\n\nIn any case, let's buy all the NVDA shares we can below $120 because my new price target for 2026 is...\n\n$200!\n\nNo one had a $2,000 price target pre-split so just ignore the Wall Street noise and stick with Cooker on the ETI that has yet to be seen!\n\nCooker\n\nWhat About Gloomy Goldman on the AI Bubble?\n\nYou've probably heard the hub-bub by now that Goldman research says the \"ROI on AI\" is non-existent. And that means of course that AI is a massive bubble ready to pop.\n\nThat's some cute \"could happen\" analysis. But it ignores what the Fortune 1000, the Global 2000, and the 20 largest nation-states are really up to: investing deeply for the future they see 5 years from now where if you don't have your own deep learning, automation and LLM expertise, you will be mere gold dust against your competitors.\n\nAnd as I've been predicting since February, the sales estimates for NVIDIA were going to cross $150 billion and head to $200 billion very soon.\n\nWell it finally happened this month with an unnamed analyst posting a high-Street peg of $180 billion for next year.\n\nI think it might be Tim Arcuri from UBS because on July 8 he talked about his bull case seeing $204 billion for next year. Here's what I posted on Twitter/X that day...\n\nUBS analyst Tim Arcuri leads the bulls with the call today for $204 billion next year, despite Goldman handwringing about \"no ROI from all those GPUs yet.\" Still building the field of dreams AI factories for science and innovation!\n\nBottom line: As I've been saying for 2 years, the analysts are still way behind the curve of what is emerging for NVDA sales over the next 3-5 years. Join me in buying every dip below $120 and if $100 scares you, buy more.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nCrowdStrike is a premier cybersecurity firm focused on end-point threat detection and response.\r\n\r\nAnd before they became headline news this weekend, the Zacks Rank detected significant downward EPS estimates on June 8. On June 11, our Short List algorithm added CRWD shares and is currently posting a 30% gain (as of 7/22) after shorting at $380.\r\n\r\nWhy is CrowdStrike Such a Big Deal?\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike's co-founders George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch were inspired by shortcomings in previous-generation security software technologies. In 2011, they focused on leveraging the network effects of crowdsourced data from their customer base applied to modern technologies, including AI, cloud computing, and responsive databases to adaptively detect threats and stop breaches.\r\n\r\nThe company's Falcon platform has expanded its market opportunity beyond core endpoint protection through offering advanced innovations using machine learning and deep learning for real-time surveillance and mitigation.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike became a household name after being called on to remediate the Democratic National Committee breach in 2016. This week, it's a household name for a completely different (and not great) reason as one of their \"software upgrades\" brought airline travel to its knees over the weekend.\r\n\r\nFragile IT Systems?\r\n\r\nThis what Nassim Taleb might call an \"anti-fragile\" wake up call for modern IT systems with built-in dependencies and extra complexity. In response to many posts on Twitter/X about the massive shutdown for Delta Air Lines, with people sleeping on the terminal floor in Atlanta for four days, I wrote this...\r\n\r\nMy report last year \"State of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0\" highlighted the state-sponsored sophistication of cyber crime and terrorism... and how hard the cybersecurity firms would have to work to keep up. Now they are so busy trying to stay ahead of the bad guys that systemic fragility gets built in.\r\n\r\nI have been a CRWD bull since $50 in 2019, and even as the valuation pushed some limits recently. Now I'll be looking for a spot to buy it again soon, maybe at 10X sales. After the 30% drop, it's now trading about 12.8X next year's projected $5 billion topline.\r\n\r\nBut those numbers could be in jeopardy if customers reposition to other vendors. The good news is that most big enterprises won't just switch from a key embedded protection player like CrowdStrike. The bad news is that this will definitely hit earnings as the company makes remediations and invests more heavily to regain trust.\r\n\r\nState of Threat\r\n\r\nIf you want a copy of my report from last October, where I explain the impact of \"Cyber Crime 3.0\", just reach out to Ultimate@Zacks.com and tell 'em Cooker sent you.\r\n\r\nHere's how I praised the company then as one of my top cyber picks when it was still trading under $200...\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike: This $44 billion leader in \"edge\" security for mobile, IoT, and government / military applications has been surging to new highs since their August 31 earnings report. As many employees and senior management continue to work from home and remotely, the threat vulnerabilities are multiplied outside of enterprise firewalls. CrowdStrike's Zero Trust solution is intended to prevent breaches in real time on any identity, endpoint, or remote workload.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks #2 Rank is more expensive given the recent stock move, but with 35% topline growth this year -- and next year projected to tag $4 billion with another 28% advance -- it's going to remain on the top list for growth investors. It doesn't hurt that profits are following with an 83% jump to EPS of $2.82. And these are the guys, led by founder George Kurtz, who have deep experience in Europe and Asia and are watching every move that Russia and China make.\r\n\r\n(end of October report excerpt)\r\n\r\nBottom line: I just shared this so you can see how I approached the growth and valuation back then. It looks like we'll be getting another chance at the stock at better bargain levels. So let's wait for the EPS estimates (and price targets) to come down and look for a buying opportunity before or after their Q2 report in late Aug/early Sep.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nRotation Trade May Prompt Stock Gains for AMPY, GLDD, TREE\n\nAt the moment, renewed interest in smaller domestic firms has led to a rotation out of mega-cap technology companies that had dominated gains in Wall Street. Interest rate cut prospects sparked off by falling inflation ignited a long-awaited rally among small-cap stocks that not only raised interest among individual investors but also billionaires like Stanley Druckenmiller.\n\nThis calls for investors to place their bets on growth-oriented small-cap stocks such as Amplify Energy Corp., Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. and LendingTree, Inc. for stellar returns.\n\nBig Tech Lose Their Appeal\n\nMarket participants have recently begun to move out of the favored tech behemoths, or the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which have mostly fueled the market rally over the past year. The group, which consists of mega-caps such as NVIDIA, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Tesla has contributed to more than half of the broader S&P 500's return in the past year.\n\nHowever, these stocks have started to wobble as investors remain jittery about their stretched valuations and are drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble. They believe that AI-driven revolutionary technology has primarily inflated the price of these mega-cap tech stocks, making them a risky bet for now.\n\nSmall Caps Are Now Wall Street Darlings\n\nIn a dramatic market shift, investors favored small-cap companies and other earlier detested sectors, including energy, real estate and finance. Small-cap stocks, in particular, have gained prominence as interest rate cut expectations increased.\n\nWith consumer price pressures ebbing amid a contraction in both manufacturing and service sector activity in June, the odds of a Fed rate cut as early as fall rise. The CME FedWatch Tool presently shows that 91.7% of market participants expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September policy meeting, up from a probability of 52% a month ago (read more: Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV).\n\nInterest rate cuts, nonetheless, are a blessing in disguise for small caps. This is because any interest rate hike impacts small caps more than large caps due to a weaker balance sheet and higher debt levels. Notably, small caps have suffered for quite some time as the Fed kept its interest rates elevated to tame relentless inflationary pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump's improving prospects in the presidential race bolstered a small-cap rally since some of his policies, such as increasing tariffs and reducing taxes, bode well for smaller companies. Likewise, the Russell 2000 Index, which predominantly comprises small-cap stocks, has gained more than 6% month to date. However, the small-cap index continues to remain below its 2021 peak, a tell-tale sign that it has more room to scale upward.\n\nDruckenmiller Making a Bet on Small Caps\n\nBillionaire investor Druckenmiller was successful in predicting the unprecedented NVIDIA stock rally. He bought several shares of NVIDIA at the end of 2022 and sold many of them at the beginning of 2024 not before he made mammoth gains.\n\nSimilarly, Druckenmiller has now raised his bets on small caps, with the May filings showing that his Duquesne Family Office has acquired stakes in the Russell ETF, an indication that not only retail investors but also billionaires are hopeful about a small-cap rally soon. IWM has gained a solid 8% so far this year.\n\n3 Small Cap Stocks Set to Rally Hard: AMPY, GLDD, TREE\n\nGiven the positives, it's judicious for astute investors to place bets on small-cap growth stocks like Amplify Energy, Great Lakes Dredge & Dock and LendingTree. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAmplify Energy\n\nAmplify Energy is an oil and natural gas company. Amplify Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 17.4% over the last 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next quarters are 41.7% and 214.7%, respectively.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 24.1% over the last 90 days.

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 1.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +133.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.69 points to a change of +106.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.38 indicates a change of +25.7% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.7%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109%. The $117.75 billion and $152.44 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +93.3% and +29.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Nvidia Stock Has Pulled Back Over 10%. Here's What History Says Could Happen Next.",
        "content": "Anyone who thought Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) sizzling momentum would go on forever without a hitch should now know better. A hitch has unquestionably arrived.\n\nSure, the high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) stock is still up close to 140% year to date. However, Nvidia stock has pulled back over 10%. Here's what history says could happen next.\n\nA track record of pullbacks and rebounds\n\nNvidia has fallen by double-digit percentages from its high plenty of times since its stock began trading publicly in 1999. The first one came only days after its initial public offering. However, within a few weeks, Nvidia shrugged off the temporary setback and marched to a new high. NVDA Chart\n\nSeveral other pullbacks of 10% or more occurred during Nvidia's first year on the market. In each case, the stock bounced back. However, Nvidia's sell-offs weren't always short-lived. Between late 2001 and October 2002, shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker plunged nearly 90%. Nvidia didn't climb back to its previous high until December 2006. NVDA Chart\n\nAnd that wasn't Nvidia's longest trough. The stock market sell-off that began in late 2007 sparked another huge sell-off of Nvidia. Although the worst was over by the latter part of 2008, it took the stock over eight years -- until May 2016 -- to recover. NVDA data by YCharts\n\nHowever, Nvidia always eventually bounced back after a major decline. Given enough time, the stock has a 100% rebound rate historically.\n\nIs this time different for Nvidia?\n\nInvestors shouldn't automatically conclude that history will repeat itself. Just because Nvidia has come back from big pullbacks in the past doesn't mean that it will necessarily do so again. Could this time be different for Nvidia?\n\nNvidia has never had a market cap of over $3 trillion before a double-digit percentage sell-off until now. The company is clearly at a different stage than it's ever been. Some could argue that Nvidia's valuation makes things different now than in the past.\n\nI question that premise, though. Based on several valuation metrics (including price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow), Nvidia isn't as expensive as it's been at other times in its history.\n\nThe factors that contributed to Nvidia's lengthy downturns in the past aren't problems today, either. While many tech stocks trade at a premium, valuations aren't at the excessive levels seen in the dot-com boom. There is no financial crisis like we saw in 2007 through 2009. Overall, the macroeconomic conditions are pretty good for Nvidia right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's current double-digit decline is mainly due to concerns about China. Bloomberg reported last week that the Biden administration could further restrict exports of chipmaking equipment to China. Soon afterward, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that Taiwan should pay the United States for defending it against attack. Although these developments are concerning for Nvidia, they don't rise to the level of the issues that have caused extended declines for the stock in the past.\n\nLook to Nvidia's future instead of its past\n\nI think that history is on the side of a relatively quick rebound for Nvidia. But I'd also argue that investors should look to the company's future instead of its past. Nvidia's share price won't bounce back because it's always done so. It will bounce back if investors are convinced that growth prospects present a compelling case for buying the stock.\n\nOn that front, there's reason to be optimistic. Nvidia will soon launch new chips based on its Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang believes Blackwell will be the company's \"most successful product\" in its history. If he's right, the current pullback presents a great buying opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into 2 Hypergrowth Stocks That Have Little to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "Three decades ago, the advent of the internet changed the growth trajectory of corporate America forever. Since then, investors have been waiting for the next game-changing innovation, technology, or trend to rival what the internet did for businesses. After decades of patience, it appears as if artificial intelligence (AI) has been anointed as the next leap forward in innovation.\n\nThe rise of AI is all about the use of software and systems for tasks that would typically be undertaken by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching potential is the capacity for software and systems to learn and evolve without human intervention. Becoming more proficient at assigned tasks, as well as learning new skills, gives this technology a limitless long-term ceiling. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nYet in spite of the otherworldly growth forecasts attached to AI -- the analysts at PwC expect AI to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- not everyone on Wall Street is convinced of its upside.\n\nBased on Form 13F filings that detail the trading activity of Wall Street's smartest asset managers, prominent billionaire investors were big-time sellers of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock during the March-ended quarter.\n\nOver a half-dozen prominent billionaires have pared down their stakes in Nvidia\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence euphoria has largely been credited with pushing Wall Street's major stock indexes to fresh all-time highs, eight successful billionaire money managers chose to send shares of Nvidia to the chopping block during the March-ended quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis and adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (4,415,510 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (4,208,010 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa (3,480,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (3,045,050 shares)\n\nWhile simple profit-taking following Nvidia's stellar run-up might explain some of this selling activity, history and valuation are the likelier catalysts.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, it's been about 30 years since the internet began changing the growth trajectory for businesses and the U.S. economy. Since then, numerous next-big-thing innovations and trends have come and gone. While some of these technologies and trends have gone on to be wildly successful over the long run, they all endured an early stage bubble. All new technologies and trends need time to mature, and artificial intelligence isn't any different. If the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests it will, no company would take it on the chin more than Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also set to face growing competition for GPU real estate in high-compute data centers. What optimists seem to be overlooking is that even if Nvidia maintains its compute advantage, its inability to meet overwhelming demand is going to allow competitors to grab market share.\n\nMoreover, its four top customers (all members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") are developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Even though these internally developed chips lack the compute advantage of Nvidia's H100 GPU, they're cheaper and are going to take up valuable data center real estate.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is that Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is on par with the peak TTM P/S ratios seen from market leaders like Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nWhat's truly interesting is that while these prominent billionaire money managers were dumping shares of Nvidia, they were busy piling into two hypergrowth stocks that have little or nothing to do with AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPlug Power\n\nThe first supercharged growth stock that caught the attention of the billionaire asset managers who've been selling shares of Nvidia is hydrogen fuel-cell solutions company Plug Power(NASDAQ: PLUG). Nvidia's three biggest billionaire sellers were all buyers of Plug Power stock during the first quarter (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (3,800,039 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (3,439,975 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (546,925 shares)\n\nThe lure of Plug Power as an investment is the high-ceiling potential of renewable energy as it pertains to transportation and infrastructure. Management believes the company can generate $20 billion in sales by 2030, which would be one phenomenal growth rate considering the company reported $891 million in full-year sales in 2023.\n\nPlug Power is in the midst of expanding its green hydrogen network. Among other things, this involves improving the efficiency of its supply chain, increasing prices across its product and service portfolio, and meaningfully improving its margins.\n\nBut in spite of its rapid growth prospects, Plug Power's future is highly uncertain. It's been a cash-burning machine since its inception and has regularly turned to share offerings in order to keep the lights on. Last week, Plug announced a $200 million share offering that was priced well below where its stock had closed the previous day. With operating losses expected to continue for years to come, more share offerings seem likely.\n\nPlug Power also has to overcome a shift in sentiment toward clean-energy vehicles. Infrastructure limitations are one reason electric vehicle (EV) demand has weakened in recent quarters. With EV demand acting as something of a proxy for hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle demand, Plug may find that the market for its products is lukewarm, at best.\n\nSea Limited\n\nThe other hypergrowth stock that had Nvidia's billionaire sellers mashing the buy button is Singapore-based Sea Limited(NYSE: SE). Even though Sea has little to do with artificial intelligence, five of Nvidia's billionaire sellers were decisive buyers in the March-ended quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,527,446 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (678,308 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (338,720 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (190,432 shares)\n\nWhat makes Sea such an appealing investment is the company's trio of fast-growing operating segments.\n\nThe division consistently responsible for generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is Sea's digital entertainment segment, known as \"Garena.\" The biggest catalyst for Garena is Free Fire, which is one of the world's most-popular mobile games. During the first quarter, Garena had nearly 595 million quarterly active users, 8.2% of which were paying to play its games. This pay-to-play ratio is considerably higher than the industry average for mobile gaming.\n\nSea's second rapidly growing segment is SeaMoney, its digital financial services operations. Many of the countries Sea operates in are chronically underbanked, with businesses and consumers lacking access to basic financial services. SeaMoney offers solutions (loans) to this common problem in Southeast Asia.\n\nBut the most-promising of all operating segments is e-commerce platform Shopee, which operates in Southeastern Asia and Brazil. The $23.6 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) traversing its platform during the first quarter equates to $94.4 billion on an annualized run-rate basis. For some context on just how quickly Shopee is growing, GMV in the entirety of 2018 was $10 billion.\n\nIf these three operating segments continue to fire on all cylinders, Sea Limited can sustain annual sales growth of 15% (or greater), and deliver triple-digit annualized earnings growth through 2028, based on Wall Street's consensus forecast.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as heavyweight technology stocks rebounded from a recent rout, although Chinese markets lagged as sentiment towards the country showed little improvement.\n\nRegional markets tracked a strong overnight session on Wall Street, which was supported chiefly by a rebound in heavyweight tech shares. Focus was squarely on upcoming quarterly earnings from tech majors Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), due later in the day.\n\nU.S. stock index futures drifted lower in Asian trade, as sentiment still remained weak amid uncertainty over the U.S. presidential elections.\n\nTech supports Asian stocks, but barely\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 0.2%, while the broader TOPIX added 0.5% on strength in technology stocks. Regional chipmaking stocks in particular tracked a rebound in artificial intelligence major NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nTaiwan shares of TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker, surged 2.7% after losing nearly 7% in the past five sessions. Shares of the firm had taken little support from positive second-quarter earnings.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI added 0.3%. Producer price index inflation data showed factory inflation grew slightly in June.\n\nBut while tech-heavy indexes saw some relief on Tuesday, they were still nursing steep declines over the past week, as bets on interest rate cuts saw investors rotate into sectors more likely to benefit from an economic recovery.\n\nAsian stocks were also battered by weak risk appetite amid increased uncertainty over the U.S. presidential race, after President Joe Biden dropped out and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump said Harris will be easier to defeat. He was also seen polling ahead of Biden and Harris according to CBS and HarrisX data, although this was prior to Biden\u2019s pulling out.\n\nA rotation into economically sensitive sectors still remained in play on Tuesday. Australia\u2019s ASX 200 added 0.7% on gains in heavyweight banks and mining stocks.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open, as a weak rupee and optimism over the Indian economy kept the index and the BSE Sensex 30 near record highs.\n\nThe Indian government is also set to present its budget for 2024 later in the day, which may spark some volatility in local markets.\n\nChinese stocks lag as economic uncertainty, Trump fears persist\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Hang Seng index shed 0.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSentiment towards China showed little signs of improving despite a surprise interest rate cut by the People\u2019s Bank of China on Monday, with analysts stating that the cut was too small to make too much difference.\n\nThe Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party largely underwhelmed investors, as Beijing unveiled few details on plans for more stimulus.\n\nBut a main point of weight on Chinese markets was speculation over a Trump presidency. Trump has maintained a largely hardline stance against China, and could impose more trade restrictions, drawing ire from Beijing.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks buoyed by tech rebound; China lags\n\nCybersecurity firm Wiz walks away from $23 billion deal with Google, memo says\n\nAnalysis-Drug giants eye China for deals despite growing Sino-US tensions",

        "content": "Three Ridiculously Overbought REITs: Buy Now Or Wait?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOn July 11, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) came below street expectations at 0.1%. Over the past six trading days, large institutions have been selling large, big-winner tech stocks such as NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and redistributing money into interest-sensitive defensive stocks such as real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nThis flow of new money has caused many REITs to soar in price, which has been a boon for long-suffering REIT investors. The Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VNQ), with nine REITs in its top ten holdings, has risen 5.42% since the CPI was released.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY. Triple-net properties can put a check in your pocket every quarter\u2014a can\u2019t-miss opportunity for accredited investors.\n\nHowever, nothing goes straight up and many of these REITs are now in \"overbought\" territory, meaning they are temporarily overvalued. This can be seen by using technical analysis indicators such as the 14-period RSI and the Full Stochastic Oscillator. These are momentum indicators that analyze overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nA stock is considered overbought when the RSI moves over 70. The higher the number, the more overbought it is. When the Full Stochastic climbs above 80, it too signals an overbought stock.\n\nOverbought doesn't automatically mean the stock will crash tomorrow. It simply indicates that the stock has reached a level where the risk of correction now outweighs the potential for further appreciation. When stocks become overbought, many investors profit, causing share prices to decline.\n\nTake a look at three surging REITs whose technical numbers are now through the roof and could be ripe for pullbacks. Investors may want to wait for lower prices before making a purchase:\n\nFour Corners Property Trust\n\nFour Corners Property TrustInc. (NYSE:FCPT) is a diversified REIT based in Mill Valley, CA. Its focus is on owning net-leased restaurants, medical and dental services, automotive services, and other retail properties in the Sunbelt regions of the U.S.\n\nFour Corners was created in November 2015 with 418 restaurants spun out from Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI). As time has progressed, many of the Darden properties have been sold off, but Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants still make up about 47% of Four Corners' total rents. In 2023, Four Corners disposed of several underperforming Red Lobster properties.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past seven years, Four Corners has steadily acquired more diversified properties. Its most recent total portfolio was 1,115 long-term leased properties with 149 brands across 47 states. Almost 20% of its properties are now comprised of medical, retail, and auto service tenants. It has continued acquiring restaurants outside of Darden brands, such as Chili's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cheddar's, KFC, Taco Bell, and Burger King.\n\nIts latest acquisition was on July 18, when Four Corners announced the acquisition of a Buffalo Wild Wings property in Texas for $2.5 million.\n\nAs of May 2024, Four Corners had a very strong occupancy rate of 99.6% with a weighted annual lease term (WALT) of 7.6 years. Its portfolio is mostly located in suburban, fast-growing areas. Less than 6.4% of its rental income matures before 2027.\n\nOn July 8, JMP Securities analyst Mitch Germain initiated coverage on Four Corners with a Market Perform rating. No price target was announced.\n\nFour Corners has gained 7.26% since the CPI was released. However, at its recent close at $27.05, the 14-period RSI was at 82.54 and the Full Stochastic was at 93.22.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\nRealty Income Corp\n\nRealty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease REIT with over 15,450 properties worldwide. The \"Monthly Dividend Company,\" as it's widely known, is a member of the S&P 500 and an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nRealty Income remains one of the foremost REITs today and with good reason. Its total return since January 1995 is 1,246.32%. Its consistently increasing monthly dividend helps retirees and other income investors pay regular expenses.\n\nOn June 3, Realty Income announced it had revised its 2024 guidance for Normalized FFO from $4.17-$4.29 to $4.19-$4.28 per share. AFFO guidance was also increased from $4.13-$4.21 to $4.15-$4.21.\n\nOn July 18, UBS analyst Brent Dilts maintained Realty Income at Buy and raised the price target from $61 to $68.\n\nRealty Income has been a stalwart REIT for decades, and income investors enjoy its monthly dividend, which has increased for 107 consecutive quarters since the IPO in 1994. The forward annual dividend of $3.156 presently yields 5.47%.\n\nThe stock is up 7.75% since the CPI was released. However, at its recent close of $57.73, the 14-period RSI was recently at 78.30 and the Stochastic was 94.91.\n\nInvestors who wish to add shares might be wise to wait for a pullback in price.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

Those areas are Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, Washington D.C., Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Terrene's occupancy as of March 31 was 98.1%.\n\nTerrene has a superior long-term growth record. Its 14-year total return is 325.09%, or 409.55% if dividends were reinvested.\n\nLike the aforementioned REITs, Terreno has performed quite well since the release of the CPI, having gained 6.98% from July 11-18. Because of that success, the 14-period RSI reached 78.62, and the Stochastic was 82.15.\n\nMany REITs have had similar gains lately, and a few others, such as Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE:KIM) and Service Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SVC), now have very high RSI and Full Stochastic numbers as well. Investors should always be cautious when technical indicators reach overbought levels. An important reminder is to let the market come to you rather than chasing runaway prices.\n\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\n\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\n\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock is jumping in Monday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was up 4.1% as of 1:30 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nNvidia stock is gaining ground today thanks to news that it's developing a new, high-performance AI processor for the Chinese market. The stock is also getting a boost thanks to bullish coverage from analysts.\n\nNvidia's strategy in China has huge implications\n\nReuters published a report this morning suggesting that Nvidia is designing a new offshoot variant of its most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) for the Chinese market. Shipments of the B20 chip and related processor technology are expected to begin in China in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nConcerns about Nvidia's ability to sell advanced processors in the country due to restrictions enacted by the U.S. and other allies have been dragging on the company's stock recently. In addition to potentially creating a sizable short-term revenue stream, the move also signals that Nvidia does not appear to pivoting from China -- one of the largest markets for its hardware and services.\n\nWall Street bulls are weighing in on Nvidia\n\nIn a note published this morning, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar raised his one-year price target on Nvidia stock from $120 per share to $140 per share. The firm's lead analyst on the company cited favorable business trends and the launch of the AI leader's new Blackwell chip platform in October as catalysts for the increase. The first Blackwell processors are expected to deliver major leaps in performance over Nvidia's current high-end chips, which are already best-in-class.\n\nLoop Capital also published a bullish note on Nvidia stock, reiterating its buy rating and raising its one-year price target from $120 per share to $175 per share. Analyst Ananda Baruah thinks the company could be on track to deliver revenue from its data center segment that far exceeds Wall Street's expectations. Baruah thinks that data center revenue for 2025 could come in between $215 billion and $240 billion, while the average analyst estimate calls for sales of $145 billion. The analyst also thinks that sales for the compute segment could hit between $200 billion and $225 billion, ahead of Wall Street's target for sales of $132 billion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "It\u2019s not yet known exactly which economic policies of the Biden/Harris administration that Kamala Harris will be focused on if she becomes the Democratic nominee or wins in November.\n\nBut there is one business world concern that has clearly piqued her interest: artificial intelligence.\n\nThe current vice president has been called Joe Biden's \"AI czar\" and has been at the center of the White House approach to an issue likely to be a front-and-center worry for the next president \u2014 whether it's a Democrat like Harris or a Republican like Donald Trump.\n\nWhen Biden signed a sweeping AI executive order last October, Vice President Harris helped shape the approach and was onstage looking on. That order launched a government-wide effort to ensure that AI systems are safe in the years ahead.\n\nThe Harris record on technology is set to be one of many things under close scrutiny in the coming days as the vice president has quickly emerged as the Democratic frontrunner after Biden ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images)\n\nThe formal process to replace Biden atop the ticket is still being fleshed out, but the Biden campaign has already changed its name to \"Harris for President\" and endorsements have flooded in from party leaders and donors.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the last three years is unmatched in modern history,\" Harris said Monday as she took the reins of his campaign during an event during NCAA Sports Day at the White House.\n\nHarris rose in San Francisco politics alongside Big Tech companies in nearby Silicon Valley and may leverage her Silicon Valley connections for further donations and support. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman quickly endorsed Harris, as did Dmitri Mehlhorn, a former Hoffman colleague who is expected to remain influential in tech circles.\n\n\"I cannot wait to help elect President Harris,\" he told Yahoo Finance in a note.\n\nOther Democratic mega-donors in the tech world offered more cautious words. But the Harris campaign quickly touted a flood of grassroots donations \u2014 including nearly $50 million in the hours after Biden announced his plan to step aside and endorsed Harris.\n\nHarris\u2019s approach to economic policy overall is not likely to be materially different from Biden's.\n\n\"We do not see much policy impact from the Harris-for-Biden swap,\" wrote Tobin Marcus, the head of US Policy at Wolfe Research, in a note to clients. He added that \"there is not much room for leftward movement based on Democratic Presidential preferences.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's also true for AI, but Harris could bring a greater focus on that issue in the years ahead if she overcomes the long odds currently facing her to beat Donald Trump this fall and become the first female president in US history.\n\nA stark contrast with Trump on AI\n\nHarris has returned to AI often in recent years.\n\nIn a speech in London last November, she focused on \"the full spectrum of AI risk\" and made the case for a strong government role.\n\nIt was a speech that took on big companies, with Harris saying that \"in the absence of regulation and strong government oversight, some technology companies choose to prioritize profit over the well-being of their customers, the safety of our communities, and the stability of our democracies.\"\n\nBut Harris has also reached out to court business leaders around AI efforts. She convened CEOs and helped shepherd a wave of business world commitments to the Biden administration\u2019s plans. Top companies like Adobe (ADBE), IBM (IBM), and Nvidia (NVDA) signed on to take these voluntary steps.

(Leon Neal/Getty Images) (Leon Neal via Getty Images)\n\nStifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner offered a note of caution to clients, writing Monday that \"some might think tech could be a winner given her connections to Silicon Valley from her time as a Senator representing California. However, if she were to win the presidency, we doubt she would have the same relationship with the sector.\"\n\nIn any case, her stance on the issue also sets up a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.\n\nAI earned a mention in the GOP platform. Republicans promised to reverse Joe Biden's approach and replace it with a new outlook focused on \"human flourishing.\"\n\nAnd a recent Washington Post report uncovered planning from Trump allies to go even further. That plan is for a sweeping executive order from Trump if he wins.\n\nIt would reportedly launch a series of \"Manhattan Projects\" to develop military technology using AI, as well as stripping away regulations for businesses.\n\nHarris has been vocal in the other direction, that government agencies need to be very careful with AI.\n\n\"The American people have a right to know that when and how their government is using AI that it is being used in a responsible way,\" Harris told reporters in a call this March.\n\nHow AI could play in the campaign to come\n\nThe back-and-forth likely to come between the campaigns could also have immediate consequences in the 2024 money race.\n\nConcerns that Democrats will \"over-regulate\" AI was a prominent reason venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz recently gave in their announcement of support for Donald Trump.\n\nSome prominent Democratic tech givers have also withheld support for Harris, for now at least.\n\nNetflix co-founder Reed Hastings told the New York Times that \"Dem delegates need to pick a swing state winner\" and didn't back Harris while also pushing for an open selection process. Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures quickly agreed and added that \"coronations are bad for democracy.\"\n\nIn her AI work, Harris has also often focused on the intersection of AI and things like equity and discrimination.\n\n\"When a young father is wrongfully imprisoned because of biased AI facial recognition, is that not existential for his family?\" she noted in her London speech, citing other examples where AI might lead to bias. Vice President Kamala Harris delivers an address on Artificial Intelligence policy on Nov. 1, 2023, in London. (Carl Court/Getty Images) (Carl Court via Getty Images)\n\nThis area could become a hot campaign issue in the weeks ahead, with Republicans often mocking efforts to bring social issues into the AI conversation.\n\nIn a charge that will surely be repeated about Harris, the GOP platform charged that Biden's executive action \"imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP\n\nA prominent tech investor predicted that NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) could achieve a market capitalization of nearly $50 trillion within the next decade.\n\nWhat Happened: James Anderson, an early investor in companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), expressed his bullish outlook on Nvidia\u2019s future potential, reported the Financial Times on Sunday. He suggested that the chipmaker\u2019s market cap could potentially surpass the combined value of the current S&P 500.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.\n\nAnderson\u2019s optimism stems from Nvidia\u2019s role in the burgeoning demand for AI chips, which are crucial for training and running advanced generative AI models. This demand has propelled Nvidia\u2019s shares to soar by 168% since the beginning of the year, pushing its market value above $3 trillion.\n\n\"The potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions. This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" Anderson said.\n\nFor context, Anderson\u2019s prediction of Nvidia hitting $50 trillion market capitalization would be nearly twice as much as the U.S.\u2019s current gross domestic product (GDP), which stands at $27.36 trillion, or nearly thrice as much as China\u2019s GDP of $17.79 trillion, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nDespite this remarkable growth, Anderson views Nvidia\u2019s potential as even greater, provided that artificial intelligence continues to deliver for customers and Nvidia maintains its lead in the industry.\n\nSee Also: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\n\nAnderson, who now runs a $650 million fund at Lingotto Investment Management, believes that Nvidia\u2019s \u201cpersistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged that the path to this potential valuation would be volatile, with possible drawdowns of 35-40%. However, he expressed confidence in Nvidia\u2019s long-term prospects, stating that the company is at the forefront of solving serious problems in areas like autonomous driving, robotics, and drug discovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnderson projected that the actual growth in demand for data center AI chips was currently around 60% annually. Looking forward over the next decade, he estimated that sustained 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, could lead to earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 per share.\n\nTrending:Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield.\n\nAssuming a 5% free cash flow yield, this analysis suggests that Nvidia shares could potentially be valued at $20,000 in 10 years, implying a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned a probability of 10-15% to achieve this scenario, according to the report.\n\nWhy It Matters: The prediction from Anderson comes amid a broader context of excitement and caution in the market. The U.S. stock market has experienced a significant rally, largely driven by the promise of AI. This surge has drawn comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs and the Nasdaq Composite index rising by 70% since the end of 2022.\n\nSee Also: This Income Stock Has Outperformed The S&P 500 For Over A Decade\n\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic. Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has pointed out \u201cwarning flags\u201d in the market, suggesting that Nvidia might be in \u201cbubble-ish territory\u201d and hinting at a potential market pullback.\n\nEven Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has acknowledged Nvidia\u2019s exceptional performance but forecasts \u201cshort-term indigestion\u201d for the company\u2019s business as customers reassess their AI strategies.\n\nDespite these concerns, some analysts remain bullish. Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, has a price target of $200 on Nvidia stock, citing the company\u2019s pivotal role in the AI space.\n\nAnderson gained prominence during his nearly four-decade tenure at Baillie Gifford. He oversaw its flagship Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which initially invested in Nvidia in 2016. His leadership played a pivotal role in transforming the Edinburgh-based private partnership into an unexpected standout in the tech investment sector.\n\nRead Next:\n\nRory McIlroy\u2019s mansion in Florida is worth $22 million today, doubling from 2017 \u2014 here\u2019s how to get started investing in real estate with just $100 Gen Z and Millennial millionaires couldn't care less for stocks and bonds \u2014 Here's what they're buying instead.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Nvidia Could Be Worth Nearly $50 Trillion In A Decade, Says Early Tesla, Amazon Investor: Nearly 2X That Of US Or 3X Of China's Current GDP originally appeared on Benzinga.com",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence tidal wave continues to reshape the technology sector, with ripple effects felt across global markets. As AI's transformative power becomes increasingly apparent to society at large, savvy investors are scrambling to identify the companies best positioned to ride this technological tsunami to stratospheric heights.\n\nTwo names stand out as particularly strong buys for long-term investors: Semiconductor juggernaut Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and the upstart delivery technology firm Serve Robotics(NASDAQ: SERV). These companies, now intertwined through Nvidia's recent strategic investment, stand at the epicenter of the AI revolution, and their stocks could be primed for even more explosive growth in the coming years. Read on to find out more. Image Source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: The company at the center of it all\n\nNvidia, the undisputed leader of AI chips, has seen its fortunes soar as demand for its cutting-edge processors reaches fever pitch. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the lifeblood of AI systems worldwide, powering everything from autonomous vehicles to language models that can engage in human-like conversation.\n\nDespite a hefty 8% pullback in the chipmaker's stock last week, a mere hiccup in its astronomical rise, Nvidia's long-term prospects remain blindingly bright. The company's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 68.9 might make some investors balk, but this premium valuation reflects Nvidia's stranglehold on the AI chip market.\n\nWith global GDP potentially set to balloon by up to $4.4 trillion annually due to AI advancements, according to McKinsey's widely cited 2023 report, Nvidia stands to reap a king's ransom. Even more conservative estimates from Accenture and Goldman Sachs, which peg AI's annual impact at around $1 trillion, still represent a gold rush of epic proportions for the chip maker.\n\nNvidia's brain trust, on the other hand, seems to think these estimates are far too conservative. The chipmaker's CEO Jensen Huang has gone on record stating that AI could unlock $100 trillion in economic value in the coming years, thanks to the advent of AI-powered agents, auto factories, digital twins, and scores of other game-changing innovations.\n\nThe bottom line is Nvidia is a must-own stock for investors who want direct exposure to the AI revolution.\n\nServe Robotics: The AI-powered delivery disruptor\n\nServe Robotics, a relative newcomer to the public markets, has suddenly found itself thrust into the spotlight. The company's semi-autonomous delivery robots, already a common sight on the sidewalks of San Francisco and Los Angeles, represent the cutting-edge of last-mile-delivery innovation.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Serve Robotics sent the latter's stock into the stratosphere last Friday, as investors took note of the game-changing potential of this partnership. Nvidia's 3.7 million shares signal a strong vote of confidence in Serve's technology and growth prospects.\n\nServe Robotics' journey from Postmates subsidiary to independent public company has been nothing short of remarkable. Its recent public offering, which raised $35.7 million in net proceeds, has provided the company with a solid foundation to fuel its expansion plans.\n\nHowever, investors should note that Serve Robotics is not without its challenges. The company's revenue stream is currently highly concentrated, with a single customer accounting for a whopping 90% of its revenue in the first quarter of 2024. This concentration risk underscores the importance of Serve's efforts to diversify its customer base.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe AI revolution is not just coming. It's here, and it's reshaping industries at breakneck speed. Nvidia and Serve Robotics represent two sides of this technological coin: the established titan providing the computational muscle, and the nimble upstart applying that power to revolutionize last-mile delivery.\n\nFor investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom, this dynamic duo offers a potent combination of established market dominance and disruptive potential. While risks certainly exist, from Nvidia's lofty valuation to Serve's customer concentration, the potential rewards could be nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "What's Going On With Alibaba And Other Chinese Stocks On Monday?\n\nChina has made a surprising move to stimulate its economy by lowering key interest rates. The decision comes as the country faces several economic challenges, including weak growth in the second quarter, looming deflation, and a prolonged property crisis.\n\nChinese stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD), JD.Com, Inc (NASDAQ:JD), Baidu, Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ:BILI) are trading higher Monday.\n\nAlso Read: Alibaba and Peers Face Challenges as U.S. Tightens Semiconductor Export Rules\n\nOn Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) announced that it would cut the seven-day reverse repo rate to 1.7% from 1.8% and reduce the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.35% from 3.45%.\n\nAdditionally, China lowered the five-year LPR to 3.85% from 3.95%. These measures aim to boost economic activity and achieve the growth targets set during the recent plenum, Reuters reports.\n\nThe PBOC has also adjusted its lending programs. Starting in July, it will lower the collateral requirements for its medium-term lending facility loans.\n\nNow, banks will need to hold fewer long-term bonds, enabling them to trade more freely and supporting the central bank\u2019s efforts to stabilize long-term yields and prevent a bond bubble.\n\nFollowing the rate cuts, Chinese sovereign bond yields fell, with 10-year and 30-year yields dropping by up to 3 basis points before stabilizing. China\u2019s 30-year treasury futures for September 2024 delivery rose by approximately 0.3% in early trade on Monday.\n\nSeparate reports indicatedthat Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a new AI chip tailored to meet U.S. export restrictions for China, which will boost stocks like Alibaba and Baidu, which are keen on pursuing their AI ambitions.\n\nAlibaba stock lost 22% in the last 12 months as it battles macro and micro headwinds including cancellation of IPOs of its logistics and cloud business and intense domestic e-commerce rivalry from PDD. Baidu lost over 39% as its AI models strive to gain traction. JD.Com\u00a0lost 32% and Bilibili in the last 12 months. PDD gained 69%.\n\nPrice Action: BABA shares are trading higher by 1.66% to $76.52 in the premarket session at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read: Alibaba Faces Setbacks with AI Expert Departure Amidst Regulatory Pressures\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Eric Prouzet on Unsplash\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALIBABA GR HLDGS (BABA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Alibaba And Other Chinese Stocks On Monday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "2 Stock-Split Stocks That Can Crush Nvidia in the Return Column Over the Next 3 Years",
        "content": "Within the last two weeks, we've witnessed the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and growth stock-inspired Nasdaq Composite catapult to record closing highs. While excitement surrounding the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has played an undeniable role in sending the broader market higher, don't overlook the other key trend powering the indexes to new heights: Stock-split euphoria.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to adjust its share price and outstanding share count, all while having no effect on its market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic maneuver that's often effected with purpose. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties: Forward and reverse. Companies conducting forward-stock splits are aiming to make their shares more nominally affordable for retail investors and their employees. Meanwhile, businesses enacting reverse-stock splits are purposely increasing their share price, usually with the goal of maintaining minimum share price listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some companies completing reverse-stock splits have gone on to be wildly successful, most reverse splits are enacted from a position of weakness. Comparatively, high-flying stocks that need to reduce their share price to make it more nominally affordable for investors and employees are typically out-executing their competition. This disparity is why most investors tend to gravitate to companies enacting forward-stock splits.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen top-tier businesses have announced stock splits. However, the outlooks for these stock-split stocks differ meaningfully.\n\nWhile AI juggernaut Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has shouldered the load in sending the major stock indexes to fresh record closing highs, it's my belief that two other stock-split stocks are positioned to absolutely crush Nvidia in the return column over the next three years.\n\nThe going is about to get considerably tougher for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's stock has risen by 765% between the start of 2023 and the closing bell on July 16, 2024, which translates into a gain of more than $2.7 trillion in market value. This outsized gain is what convinced the company's board to approve a historic 10-for-1 stock split on May 22.\n\nOn paper, everything has gone Nvidia's way. The company's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) offers clear compute advantages over what few other AI-GPU options are available. As a result, Nvidia was responsible for roughly 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year, according to TechInsights.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's chips has overwhelmed its supply. This allowed Nvidia to rapidly increase the selling price of its chips, which drove its adjusted gross margin to a scorching 78.35% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nThough things seem great on the surface, history, competition, and valuation are all headwinds that suggest Nvidia could struggle mightily in the coming years.\n\nThe headwind I continually return to with Nvidia and artificial intelligence is that there hasn't been a single buzzy innovation, technology, or trend for 30 years that's escaped an early innings bubble. Investors consistently overestimate the adoption rate and utility of next-big-thing innovations, and I don't see AI bucking this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, no company is going to take it on the chin more than Nvidia.\n\nThis is a company that can also be hurt by competition -- even if it maintains its GPU compute advantages. Stalwarts like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices are rolling out competing chips to the H100 in AI-accelerated data centers. Moreover, all four of Nvidia's top customers, which account for around 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs. With demand swamping supply, Intel and AMD should have no trouble gaining market share in high-compute data centers. All the while, AI-GPU scarcity, and Nvidia's pricing power, will wane.\n\nThe final trouble spot is Nvidia's valuation. Although its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio isn't off the charts, its trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is on par with the peak TTM P/S ratios seen from the likes of Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.\n\nAll signs point to Nvidia's stock struggling mightily over the next three years -- and the following two stock-split stocks leaving it in the dust. Image source: Sirius XM.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nThe first stock-split stock with the tools and intangibles needed to handily outperform Nvidia in the return column over the next three years is satellite radio operator Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI).\n\nSirius XM is the only high-profile stock split of 2024 that's of the reverse-split variety. When Sirius XM completes its merger with Liberty Media's Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group, during the third quarter, a 1-for-10 reverse split will be conducted.\n\nWhat gives Sirius XM a high probability of outperforming Nvidia by the midpoint of 2027 is its abundance of competitive advantages.\n\nTo start with, it's the only licensed satellite radio operator. While it still competes for listeners with terrestrial and online radio providers, being the only licensed satellite radio operator gives it meaningful subscription pricing power.\n\nMore importantly, Sirius XM's operating model is markedly different than traditional radio providers'. Whereas online and terrestrial radio stations rely heavily on advertising to keep the lights on, Sirius XM brought in less than 19% of its $2.16 billion in first-quarter revenue from advertising (which traces back to its Pandora Media subsidiary). Advertising revenue can be prone to wild swings that are dependent on the health of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nComparatively, Sirius XM generated almost 78% of its sales from subscriptions in the March-ended quarter. Subscribers are far less likely to cancel their service than advertisers are to pare back their spending during an economic downturn. In short, Sirius XM is better-positioned than its radio peers for whatever the U.S. economy throws its way.\n\nThere's also a level of cost transparency with Sirius XM that won't be found with other radio operators. No matter how many subscribers Sirius XM adds over time, its transmission and equipment costs aren't going to vary much, if at all.\n\nLastly, there's an undeniable value proposition with Sirius XM. Shares are valued at just 12 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 34% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.\n\nSony Group\n\nThe other stock-split stock with all the necessary catalysts to absolutely crush Nvidia in the return department over the next three years is Japan-based consumer electronics powerhouse Sony Group(NYSE: SONY).\n\nOn May 14, the company's board announced plans to conduct a 5-for-1 forward-stock split. For the company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), the record date for this split is Sept. 30, with an effective date of Oct. 8. In other words, Sony's stock is still roughly two-and-a-half months away from becoming nominally cheaper.\n\nSony is probably best-known for its gaming prowess, even though sales of its flagship PlayStation 5 have tapered a bit since its release in late 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The good news is that its gaming segment has two catalysts to look forward to through 2027.\n\nFor starters, subscription revenue tied to PlayStation Plus has been climbing. PlayStation Plus is a multi-tiered service that gives subscribers the ability to game with their friends, and save their gaming data in the cloud. It's a high-margin service that's likely to keep subscribers loyal to the Sony brand.\n\nTo add to this point, Sony's next-generation console is liable to come to market sometime between late 2026 and early 2028. Since next-gen console sales have historically been a key revenue driver for Sony, it wouldn't be a surprise to see shares reacting positively well before the debut of a new console.\n\nBeyond gaming, Sony Group is one of the top suppliers of image sensors used in smartphones. Wireless companies upgrading their networks to support 5G speeds have fueled a steady device replacement cycle that's lifted sales for the company's Imaging and Sensing Solutions (I&SS) segment. I&SS segment sales are forecast to grow by 15% this year.\n\nSony Group's board also believes the company's shares are trading at a discount. On the same day its 5-for-1 forward split was announced, the board approved the repurchase of up to 30 million outstanding shares (on a post-split basis). For businesses with steady or growing net income, stock buybacks have a way of lifting earnings per share and making fundamentally sound companies look even more attractive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Soars 84%, According to Loop Capital",
        "content": "Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), more commonly known as Supermicro, is one the of market's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Its shares have rallied 2,290% over the past three years as its sales of AI servers skyrocketed.\n\nYet Supermicro remains a divisive stock among analysts. Susquehanna's Mehdi Hosseini expects it to drop 60% to $325, while Loop Capital's Ananda Baruah says it can soar 84% to $1,500. Can it really hit that Street-high price target? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHow fast is Supermicro growing?\n\nSupermicro controls a much smaller slice of the traditional server market than Dell Technologies(NYSE: DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise(NYSE: HPE). However, it carved out its own niche by selling high-performance servers.\n\nThat focus made Supermicro an ideal partner for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which initially granted it access to its high-end data center GPUs before its larger competitors. That partnership gave Supermicro a first-mover advantage in AI servers, and the growth of that business accelerated over the past few years as the AI market expanded.\n\nFrom fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021 (which ended in June 2021), Supermicro's revenue increased at an anemic compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of less than 1% as it struggled with pandemic-driven disruptions and supply chain constraints. But from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023, its revenue rose at a CAGR of 42% as its EPS skyrocketed at a CAGR of 134%.\n\nThat acceleration was driven by its brisk sales of dedicated AI servers, which generated about half of its revenue by the end of fiscal 2023. Bank of America estimates Supermicro's share of the AI server market will rise from 10% in 2023 to 17% in 2026 as the entire market expands 150%. Research and Markets expects the global AI server market to grow at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 27 times next year's earnings.\n\nThe bull case vs. the bear case\n\nThe bulls believe Supermicro will maintain its early-mover advantage in the AI server market, continue to grow its market share, and expand beyond Nvidia-powered AI servers through new deals with AMD and Intel.\n\nIn Loop Capital's latest investor note in April, it said Supermicro's business \"remains healthy\" and will profit from the expansion of the AI market. Loop Capital also co-managed a $1.7 billion senior unsecured convertible notes offering for Supermicro this February, so it might have a deeper insight into its core business than other Wall Street firms.\n\nStory continues\n\nAssuming Supermicro meets Wall Street's expectations and still trades at 27 times forward earnings, its stock price could nearly hit $1,100 by the beginning of fiscal 2026. To hit $1,500 by then, it would need to be trading at about 37 times forward earnings. That's not terribly expensive for a high-growth AI stock, but it's a bit pricey compared to traditional server makers like Dell and HPE, which trade at 24 and 13 times forward earnings, respectively. If Supermicro's growth unexpectedly cools off and it's revalued as a legacy server maker again, its stock could plummet.\n\nThe bears believe that could happen for two simple reasons. First, competition from Dell and HPE -- which are both expanding their AI server businesses -- could curb Supermicro's growth and crush its margins. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia also isn't exclusive, and its top competitors are buying up a lot of those data center GPUs. Second, the broader AI market could gradually cool off, and that slowdown might be exacerbated by tighter regulations, geopolitical tensions, and export curbs.\n\nDoes Loop Capital's price target seem reasonable?\n\nI'm optimistic about Supermicro's future, but I don't think it will hit $1,500 in three years. I believe its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, but the average price target of just over $1,000 seems more reasonable in this choppy market. Over the long term, Supermicro could soar past $1,500 if it maintains its lead in liquid-cooled high-end servers and expands its slice of the AI server market. That said, investors should buckle up and brace for a lot of volatility before it reaches that target.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

China has attempted to boost its struggling economy but cutting interest rates, while Nvidia is developing an AI chip for the Chinese market.\n\n1. Biden bows out of presidential race; Harris to replace?\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday bowed to what seemed inevitable, and dropped out of the race for re-election amid concerns about his age and health.\n\nBiden backed his Vice President Kamala Harris for the job, putting her in pole position for the nomination which is officially scheduled for the Democratic convention on Aug. 19-22.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination,\" Harris said in a statement. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party \u2014 and unite our nation \u2014 to defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThis talk of unity could see the party consider a virtual nomination ahead of the convention, and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the party would soon announce the next steps in its nomination process.\n\nGoldman Sachs in a note said they did not expect the Democrats' fiscal and trade policy agenda to shift meaningfully in the event that Harris is the nominee.\n\nHarris could consolidate Black support and bring into sharper focus the differences between the two sides on abortion rights, an issue that has proved significant in other polls.\n\nBut she also faces the full weight of history as she would become the first female and only the second black President, after Barack Obama.\n\n2.

On the other hand, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.7%.\n\nThe evolving political situation will remain in focus Monday, but there are more important earnings to digest, as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) feature in a busy week for earnings, kicking off results from the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023.\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are among some of the other big-name companies set to report during the coming week, while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is set to report later Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Nvidia developing AI chip for Chinese market - Reuters\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is developing a version of its flagship artificial intelligence chips for Chinese markets that will fall in line with U.S. export restrictions, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker will work with Inspur, one of its biggest distributors in China, on a chip tentatively called the \u201cB20,\u201d the news agency said.\n\nNvidia\u2019s current AI offerings are geared specifically towards falling in line with U.S. export restrictions on China. But recent reports suggested that its offerings in the country, such as the H20, were seeing weak demand amid heavy competition from local chipmakers, specifically Huawei.\n\nIncreased interest in AI development has sparked a revenue bonanza for Nvidia, boosting the company\u2019s valuation to make it among the most valuable companies on Wall Street.\n\n4. PBOC cuts rates to boost the Chinese economy\n\nThe People\u2019s Bank of China unexpectedly cut its benchmark loan prime rates further into record-low territory on Monday, in an attempt to support the country\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nThe PBOC cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.35% from 3.45%, while the five-year LPR, which is used to determine mortgage prices, was cut to 3.85% from 3.95%.\n\nThe cuts come just a week after softer-than-expected gross domestic product data for the second quarter ramped up concerns over slowing economic growth, increasing doubts that the central bank\u2019s full-year GDP growth target will be met.\n\nChinese officials had promised more stimulus during the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Third Plenum last week.\n\nSentiment surrounding Chinese markets remains weak though, amid speculation that Donald Trump will win a second term as U.S. president.\n\nTrump has maintained a largely negative stance towards China. His administration had imposed steep tariffs on China, sparking a trade war with Beijing in the late-2010s.\n\nA second term for Trump could entail a similar scenario, which bodes poorly for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\n5. Crude market to return to surplus next year - Morgan Stanley\n\nCrude prices rose Monday, boosted by a surprise Chinese interest rate cut [see above], which is aimed at boosting the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.2% to $78.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, have weighed on the market, especially following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThese gains may not last too long though, as although the crude market is currently tight, next year it will likely be in surplus, with Brent prices declining into the mid-to-high $70s range, Morgan Stanley said.\n\nThe tightness will hold for most of the third quarter, the bank said in a note dated on Friday, but equilibrium will return by the fourth quarter, \"when seasonal demand tailwinds abate and both OPEC and non-OPEC supply return to growth.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley said it expects OPEC and non-OPEC supply to grow by about 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025, well ahead of demand growth.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBiden/Harris, Nvidia's chips, Chinese rate cut - what's moving markets\n\nTaiwan June export orders miss forecast, China demand weakens\n\nChina to extend tariff exemptions for some US imports until 2025",

        "content": "By Fanny Potkin\n\nSINGAPORE - Nvidia is working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compatible with current U.S. export controls, three sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe AI chip giant in March unveiled its \"Blackwell\" chip series, which is due to be mass produced later in the year. Within that series, the B200 is 30 times speedier than its predecessor at some tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.\n\nNvidia will work with Inspur, one of its major distributor partners in China, on the launch and distribution of the chip which is tentatively named the \"B20\", two of the sources said.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as Nvidia has yet to make a public announcement.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment. Inspur did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWashington tightened its controls on exports of cutting-edge semiconductors to China in 2023, seeking to prevent breakthroughs in supercomputing that would aid China's military.\n\nSince then, Nvidia has developed three chips tailored specifically for the Chinese market.\n\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Edwina Gibbs)",

        "title": "Exclusive-Illicit chip flows to Russia seen slowing, but China, Hong Kong remain transshipment hubs",
        "content": "By James Pomfret and Michael Martina\n\nHONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Semiconductors and other restricted goods shipped through China and Hong Kong to fuel Russia's war effort fell by a fifth this year previously undisclosed U.S. Commerce Department data shows, but Hong Kong remains a global sanctions evasion hotspot.\n\nTransshipments through Hong Kong of Common High Priority Items (CHPL) \u2014 advanced components including microelectronics deemed by the U.S. and European Union as likely to be used for Russia's war in Ukraine \u2014 fell 28% between January and May, a U.S. Commerce Department official told Reuters.\n\nFor the same period, transshipments of those items through mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, fell 19%, the official said.\n\nReuters is reporting the previously undisclosed numbers for the first time.\n\nAsked about transshipment of dual-use goods through China into Russia, the Commerce Department referred Reuters to earlier statements outlining its efforts to \"restrict Russia\u2019s access to the technologies and other items that it needs to sustain its brutal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nBoth Hong Kong and China are seen by the U.S. government as key global nodes for Russia to source materials for its military, including semiconductors and drone parts.\n\n\"I think there's some cause for being at least optimistic that we have been able to slow down some of this trade,\" the official said, but added: \"China is still our number one concern.\"\n\nThe United States and its allies have accused China of supporting Russia's war in Ukraine, in part by exporting parts and equipment needed by Moscow's weapons makers.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Treasury imposed several rounds of sanctions on entities around the world with alleged commercial links to Russia's military, including shell companies in Hong Kong that had been diverting semiconductors.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dip in illicit flows was the result of several factors, including aggressive enforcement by U.S. authorities, as well as engagement with companies whose products are being transshipped.\n\n\"We are talking to any company whose items are showing up on the battlefield,\" the official said, without giving names.\n\nThe official declined to share the full data set with Reuters, citing the need to protect the department's access to the information. \"What I can say is we have confidence in the source related to imports into Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong government did not respond to questions from Reuters about the transshipment of goods into Russia, but said it \"does not implement, nor do we have the legal authority to take action on, unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt added, however, that it was \"enforcing vigorously\" sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council, pursuant to the instructions of China's Foreign Ministry, including those with regard to North Korea.\n\nChina's Customs Administration and Foreign Ministry gave no response to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\nThere was no response to Reuters' questions from the Russian embassy in Washington.\n\nA separate customs dataset from C4ADS, a Washington-based global security non-profit, showed that over 200 Hong Kong-registered firms shipped nearly $2 billion worth of goods to Russian buyers between August and December 2023.\n\nThe data, outlined in an upcoming report by The Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation (CFHK) and reviewed by Reuters, showed $750 million worth of CHPL items -- ranging from high-end chips by Nvidia and France's Vectrawave, to lower-end chips from Texas Instruments and Intel -- were shipped via Hong Kong between August and December 2023.\n\nSome of these restricted goods were shipped to sanctioned Russian firms, CFHK said.\n\nNvidia said in a response to Reuters questions that it halted sales to Russia in March 2022 and requires its customers to comply with all applicable U.S. laws.\n\nTexas Instruments told Reuters it \"strongly opposes\" the use of its chips in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of its products to Russia.\n\nIntel said it operates in strict accordance with U.S. export regulations and sanctions and holds suppliers and distributors accountable to the same standards.\n\nVectrawave did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Our research has highlighted numerous instances where Hong Kong-based companies have facilitated the transfer of sensitive technologies and commodities, undermining international security and stability,\" said Samuel Bickett, a lawyer and author of the CFHK report.\n\nHIGH-END CHIPS\n\nThe 2023 customs data from C4ADS showed that two of the Nvidia shipments, worth $1.58 million and $1.21 million, were shipped to a Moscow-based firm named \"Lotos\" by a consignor called Malachor Electronics with a secretarial address in a plush office building in Hong Kong's central business district.\n\nThe director of Malachor, Colin Stevenson, who has a listed United Kingdom address, could not be reached for comment.\n\nBetween August and December last year, a total of $17.6 million worth of Nvidia goods were shipped into Russia by Hong Kong consignors after being traded in countries including China, Taiwan, Turkey, Thailand, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates, according to customs records reviewed by Reuters.\n\nConsignments included \"Jetson TX2\" Edge AI systems, which are among the components used in drones the Ukraine government has discovered on the battlefield.\n\n\"Pre-owned Jetsons are available through many second-hand channels. Although we cannot track products after they are sold, if we determine that any customer is violating U.S. export controls, we will take appropriate action,\" said John Rizzo, an Nvidia spokesperson.\n\nRizzo did not give details about the shipments to Lotos.\n\nOther high-end consignments included two shipments worth $1 million each of semiconductors from Vectrawave that were labelled as microprocessors. Vectrawave is a maker of specialised semiconductors for high-tech communication and defense systems including radar.\n\nThe ease of setting up and registering new firms in Hong Kong has led to a proliferation of shipping and logistics firms and other intermediaries that have also facilitated restricted trade and monetary flows with Iran and North Korea, according to the CFHK report and an examination of Hong Kong companies registry filings by Reuters. Some of these have been sanctioned by U.S. authorities.\n\nReuters found shuttered offices on visits to industrial buildings in Hong Kong close to the city's Kwai Chung container port for consigners named in customs records and corporate filings. One firm, Align Trading, the consigner for the Vectrawave chips, had an address that was a mouldy room stacked with hundreds of Hong Kong companies registry letters.\n\nLi Yanqing, a Chinese director for Align, had a listed address in Jiujiang in southern China and could not be reached.\n\n(Reporting by James Pomfret and Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Max Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Don Durfee and Daniel Wallis)",

        "content": "The technology sector has been one of the best-performing industries so far this year largely thanks to rising euphoria around artificial intelligence (AI). Megacap technology behemoths have been the biggest beneficiary of the AI movement, and one stock in particular is having a bit of a moment right now.\n\nShares of semiconductor darling Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are up a whopping 145% so far in 2024 -- making it the top performer of the \"Magnificent Seven\" by a wide margin.\n\nConsidering the AI revolution is very much in its early days, there are many reasons to believe that Nvidia's best days are ahead. However, smart investors understand that stocks don't appreciate in value forever.\n\nLet's dig into what the future could hold for Nvidia, and what it will take for the outsize momentum to normalize.\n\nNvidia's chips are in high demand, but...\n\nGraphics processing units (GPUs), a type of semiconductor chip, have become some of the most in-demand products in the AI realm right now. GPUs are currently being deployed across a number of generative AI applications in robotics, autonomous driving, training large language models (LLMs), machine learning, and more.\n\nAt the moment, Nvidia is widely considered to be the market leader in GPU technology. The company's A100 and H100 chips are used by some of the world's largest businesses, including Tesla and Meta Platforms.\n\nMoreover, the pace at which Nvidia is innovating is equal parts inspiring and impressive. Earlier this year, the company showed off its next-generation chips, known as Blackwell. According to management, demand for Blackwell is already outpacing supply -- a good indication that promising business results will continue.\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's sales and profits can be tied to the company's chip business, it's important for investors to realize that a fair amount of competition is on the horizon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n...competition is coming\n\nNvidia's closest direct competitors are Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. While each of these companies are much smaller than Nvidia, I see one big reason why their respective businesses could begin to experience some momentum.\n\nNamely, investors should be paying close attention to Nvidia's supply-and-demand trends. On the surface, rising demand can be considered a positive. In essence, when businesses witness surging demand for products and services, they can attain lucrative pricing power. This can help accelerate sales while also serving as a catalyst for abnormally high margin expansion. Subsequently, soaring profits and cash flow tend to be the net result -- which helps companies reinvest into the business and other growth initiatives. This is precisely what is going on with Nvidia right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is one drawback to outsize demand, though. If demand is so high that companies are having trouble fulfilling backlog, customers will begin looking for alternative solutions. Considering demand for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs is already outpacing supply capacity, I think this is where AMD and Intel can make a move.\n\nIn addition to AMD and Intel, Nvidia also has a number of tangential competitors.\n\nAmazon may be best known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing infrastructure, but the company has several other opportunities that could pose a threat to Nvidia. In particular, as part of its deals with AI start-ups Anthropic and Hugging Face, Amazon will be integrating more of its own homegrown training and inferencing chips into its cloud services.\n\nThis exact strategy is taking shape at Meta as well. While Meta is currently a big user of Nvidia GPUs, the company hasn't been shy about its own ambitions. Similar to Amazon, Meta is developing its own chip -- dubbed Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA).\n\nThe underlying thesis for the MTIA chip is that it can help Meta internalize more of its technology stack and rely less on external vendors. In theory, this could lead to significant cost savings in the long run while also opening up new revenue opportunities.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nConsidering Nvidia's lead in the GPU space and its unparalleled pricing power, the company is experiencing a unique period of accelerating revenue and profits. However, there are a number of direct and indirect competitors emerging that I think will take a toll on Nvidia's chip business.\n\nFor this reason, I think it's highly likely that Nvidia will eventually lose its pricing power and experience a slowdown in revenue growth. Ultimately, if Nvidia begins to experience decelerating sales, the company's margins should contract and profits will likely start to decline as well.\n\nWhile I do not think Nvidia will suddenly experience some sort of existential crisis, it's reasonable to say that the company cannot thrive on its GPU business forever. Investors looking at chip stocks may want to consider some of the alternatives explored above, as many of these businesses remain underappreciated in the broader chip realm.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock in the Second Half of 2024?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has dropped 13% over the past month. The company's share price has fallen alongside declines in fellow chip stocks like Advanced Micro Devices, ARM Holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and ASML Holding NV.\n\nOn July 17, these companies' stocks fell victim to reports that the Biden Administration was considering imposing more stringent sanctions on China's access to advanced chips. Then, a massive outage for cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike on July 19 caused mayhem worldwide, crashing countless systems and exasperating the tech market sell-off.\n\nWhile falling stock prices can be concerning, they can also create attractive investment opportunities. A tumbling share price has boosted the value of Nvidia's shares, with its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio declining 13% in 30 days. Meanwhile, the company maintains massive potential over the long term as it continues to profit from its dominant role in tech and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo, here's why it's not too late to buy Nvidia stock in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe victim of a recent sell-off\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has dipped 4% since Monday, July 15, amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China. A Bloomberg report on Wednesday described a proposed measure called Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), which would allow the U.S. to \"impose controls on foreign-made products that use even the tiniest amount of American technology.\"\n\nMore stringent restrictions illustrate the increasingly strained relationship between the U.S. and China. Wall Street has grown concerned that the situation could disrupt the supply chain in the chip market, leading chip companies to eventually lose access to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's foundry services. As a result, companies like Nvidia, which outsources its manufacturing to TSMC, have seen their stock prices take a hit.\n\nHowever, long-term-minded investors shouldn't be too worried, with domestic manufacturing options in the works. TSMC, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Samsung, and are building chip plants in the U.S., increasing the country's foundry capacity and lowering the market's reliance on the Greater China region and, more specifically, Taiwan.\n\nThe new facilities are expected to open before the end of the decade, with Intel's Ohio plant set to be operational between 2027 and 2028. Meanwhile, the company is opening factories in other overseas regions, including an $18 billion investment in a plant in Ireland.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's business will likely be secure over the long term. The company's prominent role in tech and the chip market far outweighs recent geopolitical issues, making its stock an attractive option after a sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is powering multiple industries with its hardware\n\nChip stocks have captivated Wall Street since the start of 2023, and for good reason. Sectors across tech increasingly require powerful hardware to take their products to the next level, making companies like Nvidia critical to the industry's future. And few chipmakers have achieved Nvidia's nearly unrivaled dominance.\n\nThe company emerged as the biggest threat in AI last year, achieving an estimated 70% to 90% market share in AI chips thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs). Virtually every major tech company has become a client of Nvidia, with its chips used by Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and ChatGPT Developer OpenAI.\n\nHowever, the company was a prominent figure long before the recent boom in AI. As a leading chipmaker, Nvidia's hardware powers dozens of industries. Its chips can be found running consumer products like laptops, custom-built PCs, cloud platforms, video game consoles, e-commerce logistics, and self-driving technology.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia is the exclusive supplier of chips to Nintendo's Switch console, the third-best-selling game console of all time. The partnership has catapulted Nvidia's chips into mainstream use, with 141 million units sold. Meanwhile, a sequel to the Nintendo Switch is expected to launch before the end of March 2025, which could offer Nvidia a boost in earnings.\n\nNvidia has growth catalysts throughout tech thanks to the high demand for its hardware, which will likely see its stock rise for decades. As a result, it's not too late to buy Nvidia's stock this year -- the stock could be a worthwhile investment after the recent price dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stock-Split Fever: 2 Recent Stock-Split Stocks and 1 That Could Be Next",
        "content": "This has been another year of high-profile stock-split announcements, including Walmart, ChipotleMexicanGrill, and LamResearch. And while stock splits do not change the underlying fundamentals of a company, they can boost interest in stocks. Moreover, there is some research to suggest that stock-split stocks outperform the market.\n\nHere are three stocks that have already split this year -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) -- plus one more that may split sometime soon, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's sky-high valuation could be a warning sign\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): There's no way to talk about stock-split mania without discussing Nvidia. Simply put, the stock market has gone gaga over Nvidia -- taking the company from a market cap of $280 billion to over $3 billion in just under two years.\n\nAs a result of its skyrocketing stock price, Nvidia's board of directors authorized a 10-for-1 stock split in May of this year, bringing the company's stock price down from over $1,200 to around $120.\n\nThat stock split, like all common stock splits, did not change any of the company's fundamentals.Similar to running a pizza cutter across a freshly baked pizza, a stock split simply divides what already exists into smaller, more manageable pieces; it doesn't create more pizza.\n\nUltimately, investors need to pay attention to Nvidia's fundamentals -- now more than ever. To put it bluntly, the company's stock is nearing levels that should give investors pause.\n\nTake the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, for example. Nvidia stock has a lifetime P/S ratio of 8.4x. That's much higher than the average stock, which trades with a P/S ratio closer to 3x.However, within the tech industry, P/S ratios of 6 to 10 are common.\n\nYet, what is truly concerning is that Nvidia's current P/S ratio isn't anywhere close to that range -- it's 37x. Accordingly, investors today are paying about 4 times above its long-term historical P/S average. NVDA PS Ratio ChartNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nSo, even after Nvidia's enormous revenue growth (company revenue has nearly tripled from $25 billion to $70 billion over the last two years), much of the rise of Nvidia's stock is coming from investors paying higher prices. In short, investors are paying up for future growth and hoping that the company can meet -- or beat -- rising sales expectations.\n\nThat's a risky proposition, meaning investors might want to look elsewhere for a better value.\n\nBroadcom's first-ever stock split could juice an already supercharged stock\n\nWill Healy(Broadcom): Broadcom just executed its first stock split. The technology giant has dramatically benefited from artificial intelligence (AI), and its stock has increased by more than 80% over the last year. Despite those gains, it is not necessarily too late to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom leverages AI in two ways. Its business-to-business chip solutions segment designs specialized semiconductors for its clients, and as such, it creates chips to support AI. Also, amid a growing enterprise software business, it can underpin a client's software needs.\n\nThose capabilities appeared to bolster its stock gains, particularly over the last year. That growth, in turn, likely prompted the 10-for-1 stock split it initiated on July 12.\n\nStill, investors should remember that Broadcom has been a growth stock throughout its history. The former Avago Technologies launched its IPO at a split-adjusted price of just $1.50 per share in 2009. During that time, the stock price grew by more than 100-fold. So massive was its growth that its dividend, now at $2.10 per share annually, is 40% higher than the original IPO price!\n\nDespite such increases, investors have to look past a critical financial metric. In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended May 5), net income of $3.4 billion dropped 53% yearly. That may deter investors, especially since that contributed to the P/E ratio rising to 69.\n\nAdmittedly, the high P/E ratio makes it expensive, and the stock is likely not invulnerable to a downturn should market sentiment change.\n\nHowever, investors should keep in mind that revenue rose 39% yearly over the same period, and the company used some of the revenue increase to invest in itself when it increased operating expenses by 150%. Such actions could increase profits in the long term, taking the stock price higher over time.\n\nAdditionally, the split could help as the lower nominal price makes whole shares more affordable, a factor that should add to its considerable long-term gains.\n\nTech giant Microsoft is becoming an increasingly obvious stock-split candidate.\n\nJustin Pope (Microsoft): Tech giant Microsoft hasn't split its stock in recent memory, but that could soon change. The company frequently split during the 1990s until the infamous dot-com bubble popped in 2000. Shares plunged and took nearly two decades to recover.\n\nBut Microsoft has now risen to levels few may have predicted. Technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence have continued to fuel non-stop growth over the past decade: MSFT Chart\n\nNow, shares are much higher than they were years ago. Investors and employees sitting on massive investment returns from holding stock may not want to sell in $400 to $500 increments. A stock split would lower the share price and give them some flexibility. It would also make it easier for those buying stock to build a position without having a lot of money for big purchases.\n\nA potential stock split may become more sensible over time. Analysts believe Microsoft will grow earnings by an average of over 16% annually for the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 34, which is reasonable considering Microsoft's anticipated growth.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nShares are poised to climb higher on strong earnings growth over the coming years, so a split only makes sense.

        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared more than 500% over the past three years, prompting investors to wonder if it would be ripe for a slowdown 2024. But enthusiasm about this artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader continued, and the stock surged nearly 150% in the first half. This is as the company reported triple-digit gains in earnings and prepared for the launch of a whole new architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year.\n\nMeanwhile, to make this high-flying stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split a few weeks ago. This brought the per-share price down from more than $1,000 to about $120. Now, as the second half of the year starts to unfold, investors are wondering if the stock performance slowdown some anticipated will happen -- or if this top stock will continue to roar higher and even reach $200. Is Nvidia heading to $200 in the second half? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy Nvidia has skyrocketed\n\nFirst, a quick bit about why Nvidia stock has skyrocketed in recent years -- after all, there are plenty of chipmakers out there. Nvidia's success is due to the top performance of its graphics processing units (GPUs), or chips used to power AI tasks. They are recognized as the fastest around, and on top of this, the company has developed an entire ecosystem of products and services, meaning customers can rely on Nvidia for all of their AI needs.\n\nNvidia's AI portfolio is available through the major cloud companies, making it easy to find and access these top products and services.\n\nAll of this has helped Nvidia's revenue to soar to records quarter after quarter. In the most recent three-month period, Nvidia reported $26 billion in total revenue, driven by AI demand. This is more than double the company's full year revenue as recently as in the 2020 fiscal year. So the AI boom has driven enormous growth at Nvidia, and that's why investors have piled into the stock.\n\nNow, let's consider the company's share price, about $121 as of this writing. Wall Street's average estimate calls for a 10% gain within the coming 12 months, but at least one of the most bullish analysts predicts the stock will advance 65% to $200 within that time period. Hans Mosesmann, a Rosenblatt analyst, recently raised his price target to that level from $140 -- that would bring Nvidia to almost a $5 trillion valuation from $2.9 trillion right now. Today, the market's most valuable company is Microsoft, with a market cap of more than $3.2 trillion.\n\nNvidia's triple-digit growth\n\nThough this may seem like a big potential jump, especially if we look at market value, it's important to remember that Nvidia continues to grow in the triple digits. The company predicts revenue of about $28 billion in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of more than 100% from the year-earlier period. And Nvidia has a huge catalyst ahead, the release of its Blackwell architecture and chip -- demand already has exceeded supply and Nvidia expects this trend to continue into next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this means it's very possible Nvidia could reach $200 a year from now. What about in the second half of this year though? Nvidia is likely to gain, maybe even in the double digits, buoyed by optimism about the Blackwell release and ongoing growth. But I wouldn't expect the stock to reach $200 so quickly. Some investors may wait to monitor the Blackwell release and see how it translates into earnings growth.\n\nWhat does all of this mean for you as an investor? It actually doesn't matter whether Nvidia reaches $200 this year, next year, or a bit later. What's most important is Nvidia's ability to maintain its AI leadership and generate earnings growth over time -- if the company can do this, there's reason to be optimistic about long-term stock performance. And, right now, considering Nvidia's solid AI platform and plans for annual innovation, there's reason to be optimistic about this top AI stock over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia Stock and Buying an Index Fund That Could Soar Up to 5,655%, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the hottest investment themes on Wall Street this year, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the quintessential AI stock due to its leadership in machine learning processors. But certain Wall Street analysts see a substantial opportunity taking shape around Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) due to the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nGautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra at Bernstein believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, $500,000 by 2029, and $1 million by 2030. That forecast ultimately implies 1,415% upside from its current price of $66,000. Last year, Cathie Wood estimated Bitcoin could reach $1.5 million by 2030, but she upped that figure to $3.8 million following approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Her latest forecast implies 5,655% upside from the current price.\n\nSeveral successful hedge fund managers sold shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, while simultaneously buying shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust(NASDAQ: IBIT), one of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nKen Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 2.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake 68%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. David Shaw at D.E. Shaw sold 1.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 38%. Meanwhile, he started a small position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Israel Englander of Millennium Management sold 720,004 shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 35%. Meanwhile, he started a rather sizable position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust, such that it ranks as his twelfth-largest holding excluding options contracts.\n\nThe three billionaires mentioned above are noteworthy because they run the three top hedge funds as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Readers should not interpret their trades to mean Nvidia is a bad investment, but rather that diversification has merits. Here's why the iShares Bitcoin Trust is a worthwhile long-term holding for risk-tolerant investors.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs are unlocking demand from institutional investors\n\nAt any given moment, Bitcoin's price is determined by supply and demand. However, its supply is limited to 21 million coins, so demand is ultimately the driving force behind price action. In other words, demand for Bitcoin would need to increase substantially for its price to reach $1 million, and even more substantially for its price to reach $3.8 million.\n\nBernstein and Ark Invest believe that demand will come from spot Bitcoin ETFs, a brand new asset class approved by the SEC earlier this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin by holding the cryptocurrency as the underlying asset, and they eliminate traditional sources of friction that may have kept retail and institutional investors out of the market, as detailed below.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs let investors add Bitcoin exposure through existing brokerage accounts. That eliminates the complexity of maintaining a separate portfolio with a cryptocurrency exchange. It also simplifies tax reporting because most brokerages link directly to tax preparation software. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are often cheaper. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has an expense ratio of 0.25%, meaning investors will pay $25 per year on every $10,000 in the fund. But Coinbase charges 0.4% to 0.6% per transaction for orders under $10,000, meaning investors get hit with higher fees twice -- once when they buy, and again when they sell.\n\nBernstein and Ark Invest expect Bitcoin to follow different trajectories over the next decade, but they agree on one thing: Demand from institutional investors will drive the forecasted gains.\n\nWe are still in the early stages of adoption, but institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is evident in recent Forms 13F filed with the SEC. As mentioned, the top three hedge funds -- Citadel Advisor, D.E. Shaw, and Millennium Management -- have started positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. Several major investment banks, including JPMorganChase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo, have also bought into spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nHowever, most institutional investors have very small positions at the present time, meaning their stakes represent inconsequential portions of their portfolios. But Bernstein analysts Chhugani and Sapra believe institutional investors are \"in the process of evaluating 'net long' positions as they get comfortable with the improving ETF liquidity.\"\n\nSimilarly, Cathie Wood at Ark Invest believes institutional investors will eventually put a little more than 5% of their portfolios into spot Bitcoin ETFs. For context, institutions had nearly $120 trillion in assets under management last year, so Ark's forecast implies that those investors will allocate more than $6 trillion to spot Bitcoin ETFs in the future. Should that happen, Wood says the price of Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million.\n\nHistory says Bitcoin will reach a new high between April 2025 and October 2025\n\nBernstein is also bullish on Bitcoin because of the halving event that took place in April 2024. \"We believe a new cycle commencing with halving is not a coincidence, but driven by unique demand-supply dynamics,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note.\n\nTo elaborate, Bitcoin block subsidies -- newly minted Bitcoin awarded to miners for solving cryptographic puzzles to verify transaction blocks -- are reduced by 50% every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain. Those halving events happen about once every four years, and the most recent one took place in April.\n\nThat is significant because Bitcoin has gone through three halving events before, and it's price has always reached a new peak 12 to 18 months later, as shown in the chart below.\n\nHalving Date Peak Return Time to Peak Return November 2012 10,485% 371 days July 2016 3,103% 525 days May 2020 707% 546 days\n\nSource: Fidelity Digital Assets.\n\nAs shown above, post-halving returns have diminished with each subsequent halving event, simply because each subsequent halving event has a smaller impact on the total supply. But history suggests Bitcoin will peak sometime between April 2025 and October 2025.\n\nA word of caution for investors\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future returns, and price targets should never be taken for granted. Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and its limited track record means that forecasting its performance is essentially impossible.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin has declined by more than 50% on several occasions and similar drawdowns are plausible (if not probable) in the future. Investors comfortable with those risks should consider buying a position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust today. Adding exposure to the cryptocurrency is a great way to diversify a portfolio overloaded with AI stocks like Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Bitcoin Trust right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Bitcoin Trust, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and iShares Bitcoin Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Every Chip Stock Investor Should Hold a Position in Intel, and We Were Just Reminded Why",
        "content": "The prospect of tighter U.S. restrictions on exports to China and recent comments from presidential candidate Donald Trump knocked some of the wind out of chip stocks. Semiconductor stocks slid as the Biden administration floated the prospect of tougher trade restrictions on the industry while Trump suggested that if elected, he would want Taiwan to pay the U.S. for its defense. Taiwan, home to leading foundry operator Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), captures about 62% of the revenue generated globally by chip foundries, according to TrendForce.\u00a0 Concerns about the future led to a sell-off in TSMC as well as stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), which depend on TSMC's fabs for production and also reported significant sales to China.\n\nOne of the few stocks that responded positively to this news from the presidential candidates was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), whose stock price spiked sharply higher in Wednesday trading before pulling back for a modest gain. And while that surge of enthusiasm waned quickly, it was a reminder of why serious semiconductor industry investors should have at least some Intel stock in their portfolios.\n\nThe state of Intel\n\nAdmittedly, Intel's heyday is likely long behind it. It lags behind AMD on the chip design side of the business, and its new third-party fab operation, Intel Foundry Services (IFS), is behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process technology.\n\nHowever, Intel has the advantage of location: Most of its foundries are outside of East Asia. Thus, when political figures raise the prospect of trade restrictions or say things that intensify concerns that China could invade Taiwan, investors look to Intel as a safer bet.\n\nThe supposition that China will invade Taiwan is speculation. What is not speculated is that the chip foundry industry is concentrated in Taiwan. To this end, the U.S. and other Western governments are offering chipmakers tens of billions of dollars worth of subsidies to build more advanced fabs in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nSuch subsidies benefit Intel and its plans to build state-of-the-art fabs. Additionally, since it is buying the most advanced chip-manufacturing equipment from ASML, its potential to catch up to its competitors rapidly is better than some might assume.\n\nMaking sense of Intel's financials\n\nAs a result of its investments in building out manufacturing capacity, Intel's financials are improving, but still struggling. In the first quarter, its revenue rose 9% year over year to $13 billion. That was a notable improvement from its 14% revenue decline in the full year of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid heavy investments in its future, it spent 15% more on operating expenses. Despite that increase, its Q1 net loss shrank to $381 million, a small fraction of the $2.8 billion it lost in Q1 2023.\n\nManagement did not forecast significant revenue growth for Q2. Consequently, its stock has fallen by more than 30% so far this year. Also, if there's no political turmoil regarding Taiwan, investors should not expect the semiconductor stock to outperform the S&P 500 anytime soon.\n\nStill, this stock trades now at a price-to-sales ratio of less than 3 -- a massive discount to its peers. INTC PS Ratio Chart\n\nHowever, the ultimate measure of Intel's low valuation is its price-to-book-value ratio of 1.4. This means its total market cap is only 40% more than the market value of its assets. According to the Stern College of Business, the average book-value multiple in the chip industry is above 7, implying Intel stock is significantly oversold.\n\nIntel as a hedge\n\nGiven its current position, Intel is a vehicle investors can use to hedge their positions in chip stocks more closely tied to China and Taiwan, and shares bought now could eventually turn out to have been a low-cost investment in an industry leader.\n\nAdmittedly, Intel stock is unlikely to beat the indexes anytime soon, and its massive investments in itself are no guarantee it will catch up to its peers competitively.\n\nHowever, it is likely to close much of the gap over time, and its current and future operations in the U.S. and Europe protect the semiconductor industry from possible turmoil in East Asia. When one also considers its low valuation, an Intel position can protect chip stock investors and possibly produce significant returns in the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller is one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of $6.2 billion as of this writing, according to the \"Real-Time Billionaires List\" from Forbes. And he was able to pad his numbers with an extremely timely investment in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Druckenmiller bought over 580,000 shares of Nvidia for his investment firm Duquesne Family Office. As of the first quarter of 2024, he's reduced his stake in Nvidia down to about 176,000 shares. But that's after riding his position to enormous gains. NVDA Chart\n\nDruckenmiller swapped out shares of one of the most valuable companies on earth -- Nvidia -- with shares in something that's on the other end of the spectrum entirely. A May filing revealed that Duquesne Family Office had purchased a position in the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM), roughly valued at $700 million right now.\n\nMost investors are aware of the S&P 500 -- an index of 500 of some of the largest companies on the stock market. But fewer are aware of the Russell 2000 index, which is for small-cap stocks. In short, Druckenmiller expects shares of smaller companies to generally perform well from here.\n\nThere's good reason to believe this. According to Yardeni Research, valuations for large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks were comparable before the pandemic. But right now, the average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22, whereas the forward P/E for the S&P SmallCap 600 is about 15 -- more than 30% cheaper.\n\nSmart investors see this valuation gap between the big companies and the small ones. The small ones are being overlooked and are consequently cheap, which creates an opportunity that Druckenmiller apparently wants to exploit.\n\nIt may have been a timely bet. As the chart shows, performance for the Russell 2000 is quickly perking up, with the corresponding exchange-traded fund (ETF) jumping 13% in just the past month. IWM Chart\n\nFor investors looking to follow Druckenmiller's moves, they could buy shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF like he did. But remember that this is a bet on small-cap stocks in general. He likely made a generalized bet because he has too much money to invest. He can't pick individual small-cap stocks because he would acquire too big of a stake, running into regulatory issues and potentially moving the market.\n\nBy contrast, most regular investors can buy top small-cap stocks without worrying about controlling too much of the company. Identifying the best ideas in the small-cap space might be a better way to imitate Druckenmiller in this case. And I have three ideas for investors to consider: Xometry(NASDAQ: XMTR), Driven Brands(NASDAQ: DRVN), and PubMatic(NASDAQ: PUBM).\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Xometry\n\nXometry operates an online marketplace for the manufacturing industry and powers it with its artificial intelligence (AI) software. Without getting into the weeds, I believe that the numbers suggest that its AI-powered platform offers players in this space something special.\n\nAt the end of 2019, Xometry only had 11,500 active buyers total, and less than 300 of these spent more than $50,000 annually. But as of the first quarter of 2024, the company had 58,500 active buyers, with nearly 1,400 spending more than $50,000 annually. That's a lot of traction in a short time for a small platform. And it suggests that the platform is good enough to attract users.\n\nXometry has less than $500 million in annual revenue in a space valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars -- upside potential is likely if it's true that its platform offers users something better than what they're used to.\n\nThe company isn't profitable yet. But it's getting closer to positive cash flow with scale, which is why this is an interesting idea now. Once it's profitable, more investors will likely take notice, giving an advantage to investors today who noticed the improvement beforehand. XMTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\n2. Driven Brands\n\nDriven Brands is a company that uses a roll-up strategy in the automotive space. It operates several different chains, including car washes, mechanic shops, and windshield repair. The idea is that by rolling up a bunch of companies under one parent company, it can benefit from brand recognition and economies of scale.\n\nThere are admittedly headwinds for Driven Brands right now. For example, in the first quarter of 2024, its car wash division accounted for 25% of revenue, but revenue in this segment was down about 8% year over year. And management only expects about 4% top-line growth for its business as a whole this year, which isn't very exciting.\n\nDriven Brands has an enterprise value of $5 billion (for the record, this is technically a mid-cap stock, not a small-cap stock). And in 2024, management expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of at least $535 million. That means the company is valued at just 9 times its profits.\n\nI mentioned enterprise value and EBITDA because these are metrics commonly used for companies with high levels of debt. Driven Brands has $2.9 billion in long-term debt, mostly because of its roll-up strategy. That's a heavy load, but it explains why it's cheap right now: Interest rates are up, lowering investor appetite for companies with debt.\n\nI like Driven Brands because it operates boring businesses that are always in demand. And its strong adjusted profits make me comfortable with its debt. But if interest rates drop, I believe the market will give it more credit than it's giving it now. Economists believe it's increasingly likely that interest rates will drop before the end of 2024, which is why this is an idea to consider right now.\n\n3. PubMatic\n\nFinally, PubMatic is a programmatic advertising-technology (adtech) company that's as financially secure as any small-cap stock around. For investors worried about the economy, this is a small player that can press on through hard times.\n\nRegarding its financial fortitude, PubMatic has $174 million in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. The company doesn't have long-term debt and doesn't plan to. Moreover, it generates positive cash flow.\n\nPubMatic is in a good place competitively as well. The company partners with publishers to get ad space sold. There are a lot of small players here. But with PubMatic's supply optimization product, it helps its customers go from many software providers to just two or three, leaving itself in the mix, of course.\n\nDigital advertising is facing a slowdown as consumer spending cools. But this is routine from a macroeconomic perspective. Whether it's next week or next year, spending will rebound, and digital advertising will perk up, to PubMatic's benefit. And thanks to its financial fortitude, it can afford to calmly wait things out until then.\n\nPubMatic's growth rate has accelerated recently, so I think this business will bounce back sooner rather than later. And that's why PubMatic joins Xometry and Driven Brands as smaller, undervalued companies I believe investors should consider buying now, following Druckenmiller's current conviction for small-cap stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Xometry right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Xometry, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Xometry wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other profitable stocks.\n\nThe stock market has a long history of generating wealth for investors. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.\n\nInvestors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. You can also discover some undervalued value stocks by reading 11 Oversold Value Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has seen several major events since 2000, including the dot-com boom and fall, the 2008 financial crisis, a tech boom with trillion-dollar values, and the 2020 pandemic crisis. The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market.\n\nAccording to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.\n\nAs interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar. To satisfy market demand, businesses are making significant investments in AI. AI's impact on altering work patterns was highlighted by Satya Nadella du. According to them,:\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the most profitable stocks, we looked at the 20-year annualized returns of publicly traded companies in the US market from 2004 to 2024 and selected and ranked those with the highest 20-year annualized returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\n20-Year Annualized Return: 39.81%\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) tops the list for being one of the most profitable stocks over the past 20 years, delivering exceptional returns to investors. Bullish analysts are highly optimistic about NVIDIA's future prospects. NVIDIA has recently achieved significant milestones across various sectors, particularly in AI and cloud computing. GeForce NOW, its cloud gaming platform, has reached over 30 million users and added popular games like \"Resident Evil Village.\" In AI, NVIDIA AI Enterprise has gained traction, helping businesses implement AI solutions. In the automotive sector, NVIDIA's system-on-a-chip is deployed in NIO's self-driving cars.\n\nThe NVIDIA Partner Network has expanded, recognizing 14 partners for AI achievements across industries. Additionally, NVIDIA leads in generative AI development, and five leaders were honored by the Silicon Valley YWCA for their contributions, underscoring the company's leadership and diversity commitment.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recorded revenue of $26.0 billion in Q1 2025, marking an impressive 262% surge year-over-year. The non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.12, up 461% year-over-year. The stellar performance was largely driven by the Data Center segment, which reached a record $22.6 billion in revenue, up 23% quarter-over-quarter and 427% year-over-year. This growth was fueled by strong demand for NVIDIA's Hopper-based GPUs, particularly for generative AI training and inference across cloud providers, consumer internet firms, enterprises, and other sectors. NVIDIA's upcoming Blackwell platform, designed for trillion-parameter-scale generative AI, is anticipated to further accelerate data center revenue starting in Q4. Additionally, Networking revenue surged over triple digits year-over-year to $3.2 billion which was driven by increasing AI infrastructure needs.\n\nIn Q1 2024, there were 186 hedge fund holders in the company, up from 173 in the previous quarter. Citadel Investment Group held the largest position in the company with 207,354,000 shares worth $18,735,678,024.\n\nNVIDIA stock holds a \"Strong Buy\" rating from 40 analysts. Among the 39 analysts providing 12-month price forecasts, the average target is $125.64, ranging from $62 to $200. This suggests a potential decrease of -2.06% from the current stock price of $128.28.\n\nOverall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the most profitable stocks of the last 20 years. You can visit 20 Most Profitable Stocks of the Last 20 Yearsto see the other profitable stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA andJim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stakes were already elevated for technology giants heading into this earnings season. They just got a lot higher after the worst week for the Nasdaq 100 Index in three months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nZuckerberg Calls Trump\u2019s Response to Shooting \u2018Badass\u2019 From ATMs to Flights, Epic IT Crash Leaves Trail of Chaos CrowdStrike\u2019s Global Outage Doesn\u2019t Have to Be a Recurring Nightmare Travel Chaos Mounts as Airlines Resume Flights After Outage How a Routine CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World\u2019s Computers\n\nAfter driving the rally in US stocks for most of the year, Big Tech slammed into a wall this week. Investors rotated from high-flying megacap shares to riskier, lagging parts of the market, spurred by bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, the threat of more trade restrictions on chipmakers and concern that the hype around artificial intelligence may be overblown. AI darling Nvidia Corp. sank 8.8% this week, while Amazon.com Inc. dropped 5.8%.\n\nWith Wall Street projecting that the tech behemoths\u2019 profit growth is poised to slow, traders are plowing this year\u2019s winnings into cheaper areas \u2014 like small-capitalization stocks caps that stand to benefit from lower borrowing costs, and sectors like health care, where earnings are expected to perk up. It\u2019s all heightening the focus on next week, when major tech companies start reporting quarterly results.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of reasons to think tech will be less friendly over the coming year,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cAt these levels, everything has to go right.\u201d\n\nHeading into the key stretch of announcements, the Nasdaq 100 is up 16% this year after this week\u2019s 4% tumble, its steepest since April. The S&P 500 Index is up about 15% in 2024, with much of the advance generated by the largest tech stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. kicks off earnings for the cohort Tuesday, along with Tesla Inc. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. Amazon and Meta Platforms Inc. are due the following week. The entire group has benefited from AI-fueled optimism and investors will want some reassurance that the technology will move the needle for profit and revenue gains.\n\nAn \u201cepic\u201d reversal from Big Tech will continue unless the companies can convince analysts to raise their sales estimates for the second half of the year and 2025, Goldman Sachs strategists including David Kostin wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\n\u201cIf these companies can\u2019t generate meaningful profits and revenue from AI, and you remove the impact of that idea, then the stocks go back to where they were a year ago,\u201d said Samana at Wells Fargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe five biggest US technology companies \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon \u2014 are facing tough comparisons with the stellar earnings cycles of the past year. Profits for the group are projected to rise 29% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n\nWhile still strong, that\u2019s down from the past three quarters, when growth for the group ranged from 44% to 49%. The overall message from Wall Street: Expect results to show the companies are still booming, but not to the extent seen last year.\n\nGoogle, Tesla\n\nThere are other themes investors will be drilling down into starting next week.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet, for example, will give a glimpse into the health of the digital advertising market. The search giant is projected to deliver profit of around $23 billion on revenue of $70.7 billion in the second quarter, up 25% and 14%, respectively, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnd with electric-vehicle demand mired in a slump, money managers will be keenly interested in Tesla\u2019s announcement. The carmaker\u2019s profit is projected to shrink 37% in the second quarter to $1.7 billion, while sales are expected to decline 1% to $24.6 billion.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t dampened the mood for the stock, which is up almost 70% from an April low. Tesla investors are pinning their hopes on Elon Musk\u2019s promised robotaxi service. After the company postponed an event initially scheduled for next month, investors will be looking for details on Tesla\u2019s earnings call about progress on the self-driving car initiative.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings Inc., the cybersecurity company responsible for a global IT outage on Friday, isn\u2019t expected to report earnings until late next month.\n\nWay Up\n\nDespite the latest declines, stocks like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are still sitting on big gains. Nvidia, which is expected to report late next month, has more than doubled this year while Facebook\u2019s owner has advanced more than a third. As a result, valuations for many remain stretched. Nvidia is priced at 37 times projected profits for the next 12 months, while Microsoft and Apple both trade at more than 31 times.\n\nThe average valuation for the S&P 500 is 21 times. The benchmark for small-cap shares, the Russell 2000 Index, trades at about 26 times estimated profits.\n\nThe tech sector is the only segment where valuations are above historical averages and analysts have still been revising estimates higher, according to Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. That\u2019s created a situation where misses are likely to be punished, she said.\n\n\u201cA miss in tech is to be classified as an unforgivable sin in the market right now because expectations are so high,\u201d she said.\n\n--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 20 Years?",
        "content": "There's one stock that everyone wants to talk about: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). And for good reason. The stock has gained nearly 1,000% in less than two years, meaning a $10,000 investment in late 2022 would be worth almost $100,000 today.\n\nWhile nobody can predict what will happen, there are two paths forward for Nvidia. One path is promising; the other is downright terrifying. Let's dive in and see which is more likely. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bull case: Nvidia is Apple circa 2004\n\nThe bull case for Nvidia goes something like this: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the story of the next 20 years. It will bring changes to the way people interact on a level equal to or exceeding those brought on by the smartphone in the mid-2000s. Therefore, the best historical comparison for Nvidia is Apple in 2004.\n\nBack then, Apple's hot new product was -- wait for it -- the iPod. Remember that? The company wouldn't debut its first iPhone for another three years.\n\nNevertheless, Apple was already well on its way to becoming the world's largest company. In 2004, its stock grew by more than 200%, making it the top performer in the S&P 500.\n\nFrom 2004 until today, its market cap has surged at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. A $10,000 investment made 20 years ago would be worth $4.8 million today. AAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nIt would be incredibly difficult for Nvidia to repeat that performance, but it is possible. AI is a fascinating new technology, and 20 years is a very long time, giving the company plenty of runway to live up to the lofty expectations surrounding its stock.\n\nBut what about the bear case?\n\nThe bear case: Nvidia is Oracle circa 2000\n\nThis is the bear case for Nvidia: AI is a promising technology but overhyped. Due to elevated valuations in AI stocks, a stock market bubble has formed, and when it pops, Nvidia's stock will feel the pain. In short, Nvidia today is like Oracle in 2000.\n\nTo recap, the 1990s were full of hope for the internet. In particular, the stock market went gaga for internet stocks. Valuations soared, not just for brand-new companies but also for legacy tech companies that were cashing in on the internet craze.\n\nIn particular, Oracle, whose business revolved around facilitating the transition from mid-century mainframe computers to modern servers for enterprise clients, saw its stock skyrocket in the late 1990s.\n\nUnfortunately for Oracle, expectations ran far ahead of actual sales. At its peak in 2000, its stock traded with a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 24, far above its lifetime average of 5.  ORCL PS Ratio Chart\n\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, Oracle experienced an 85% drawdown. The stock has taken over 20 years to recover its pre-bubble high. Those who bought in the summer of 2000 and held through 2020 would have made almost no money on their investment.\n\nStory continues ORCL ChartORCL data by YCharts.\n\nIt's a lesson that even companies with the most promising technological innovations and solid business models don't necessarily make great investments.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nOn the one hand, Nvidia's P/S ratio has a scary resemblance to Oracle's in the run-up to its crash in 2001. ORCL PS Ratio Chart\n\nThat should give pause to any Nvidia bull. Simply put, the stock is so expensive now that some moderation must occur.\n\nEither the company's sales will continue to grow like a weed to bring down the ratio, or the stock price will have to come down. Factors such as increased competition, market saturation, or a slowdown in AI and semiconductor spending could decrease Nvidia's P/S ratio.\n\nMy gut tells me it's the latter, although the party could continue for some time. Either way, I recommend caution with Nvidia stock.\n\nUnlike many of its mega-cap peers, the company lacks a well-diversified business model. Its stock is performing well because AI and semiconductor spending has gone through the roof, but that trend may taper off -- particularly if the economy deteriorates or enters a recession.\n\nMoreover, if the demand for AI and semiconductor technology were to decline, Nvidia's stock could be in for a rough ride -- perhaps as bad as Oracle's 23 years ago.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Things Every Nvidia Investor Must Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become the hottest stock on the market due to its incredible rise thanks to unprecedented demand for artificial intelligence (AI). With the stock recently up around 160% this year, its rise has made many investors a lot of money.\n\nHowever, if you're going to be an Nvidia investor, there are three things you must know that could affect your perspective on the stock.\n\n1. Nvidia is historically a cyclical company\n\nAlthough Nvidia has some software products, it's not a software company. Its primary product is its graphics processing units (GPUs), which enable its users to train AI models. Because GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, they are effective at complex computing tasks. Combine that with the ability to hook hundreds or thousands together, and it makes sense that Nvidia's GPUs are flying off the shelf.\n\nHowever, times aren't always peachy at Nvidia.\n\nThe chip industry is known to be cyclical, as demand rises and falls based on a secondary trend. Nvidia's last two cyclical cycles were tied to cryptocurrency, and the company saw significant revenue drawdowns after the cycle was complete. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHowever, Nvidia has always emerged a stronger company from its various cyclical drawdowns. This is key, as investors must weigh this success against the backdrop of another drawdown that is eventually coming.\n\nOnce AI computing demand is built out, Nvidia will undoubtedly see a drop in demand. The problem is, nobody knows if that's in the next quarter, next year, or the next decade. If it doesn't occur for a while, investing in Nvidia now could be smart. But investors could be in trouble if it's right around the corner.\n\n2. Nvidia's valuation is incredibly high\n\nAfter a run-up like Nvidia's, it's no surprise that the stock has a premium price tag attached to it. But just how expensive is it?\n\nBecause Nvidia is a mature company, using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a smart idea. Additionally, because Nvidia is experiencing significant change, the forward P/E ratio is also a useful metric, as the two combined show what expectations are built into the stock over the next 12 months. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nA valuation of 47 times forward earnings is incredibly expensive, especially considering the S&P 500 trades for around 22.7 times forward earnings. Because of Nvidia's premium status and top-tier execution, seeing the stock trade at a 30 times earnings multiple when the pandemonium has settled down isn't out of the question. But for Nvidia to reach that valuation, it must grow its earnings by 151%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile some may think that's easy, especially considering that Nvidia grew its earnings per share by 629% in Q1 of FY 2025 (ending April 28), it will start reaching quarters with tougher comparison figures. As a result, its growth rates won't look as impressive, even though they will still be rapid.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow its earnings by 60% over the next 12 months. So it's not out of the question that the company must continue growing at its current pace for two years to return to a reasonable valuation.\n\nThat's a long time of sustained strong growth. But is it realistic?\n\n3. AI demand isn't going away\n\nAlthough it seems like all anyone has talked about is AI this and AI that, it's because AI will be a life-altering product like the internet. Technology has barely scratched the surface of how AI can assist in daily tasks, and to power the next wave of innovation even more computing power will be needed.\n\nFurthermore, a GPU used in a data center lasts around five years, so eventually it will need to be replaced. This will fuel another wave of demand for Nvidia's GPUs, which could further extend Nvidia's growth.\n\nAs an investor, Nvidia's valuation scares me. But there is a case to be made that the stock could still be worth the price you're paying today if the growth extends out for another few years.\n\nIf you keep that in mind, Nvidia stock may be for you. Otherwise, if you invest in an index fund, you'll still have heavy Nvidia exposure because it makes up about 6.7% of the S&P 500.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Right Now",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has grown rapidly over the past few years as companies developed new algorithms to analyze data more efficiently. The rise of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been driving companies to explore new ways to create content, automate tasks, and replace human workers.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global AI market could still expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6% from 2024 to 2030. That's why many AI-driven stocks -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) -- rallied over the past year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut in the first quarter of 2024, some closely followed billionaire hedge fund managers sold those three high-flying AI stocks. Let's see how many shares they sold -- and whether it makes sense for long-term investors to follow that lead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia, the leading producer of high-end data center GPUs for processing complex AI tasks, is still one of the market's hottest tech stocks. However, several prominent billionaire investors -- including Philippe Laffont, Ken Griffin, and Israel Englander -- significantly reduced their positions in Nvidia in the first quarter of 2024. Laffont and Griffin both sold 68% of their shares, while Englander reduced his fund's stake by 35%.\n\nThose sales seem premature considering the market's demand for Nvidia's data center GPUs is still outstripping its available supply and giving it tremendous pricing power. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 46% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 53%. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that still trades at less than 50 times forward earnings.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nBillionaires are also taking profits in Super Micro Computer, a leading maker of dedicated AI servers. Richard Driehaus, Ken Griffin, and Cliff Asness reduced their stakes in Supermicro by 41%, 8%, and 73%, respectively, in the first quarter.\n\nThat profit-taking is a bit surprising because Supermicro is still firing on all cylinders. It already generates over half of its revenue from dedicated AI servers, and analysts at Bank of America expect its share of that market to grow from 10% to 17% over the next three years. According to Research and Markets, the global AI server market could continue to expand at a CAGR of 26.5% from 2024 to 2029.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 58% and 52%, respectively. At 27 times next year's earnings, it still looks like an undervalued growth stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, rallied over the past year as its core advertising business recovered. But in the first quarter, several big billionaire investors backed away. Lee Ainslie and Ken Griffin reduced their positions by 51% and 47%, respectively.\n\nBack in 2022, Meta's ad sales were throttled by Apple's privacy-oriented iOS changes, competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and other macro headwinds. But in 2023, its ad sales accelerated as it rolled out new AI algorithms to counter Apple's changes, expanded its Reels short video platform to widen its moat against TikTok, and attracted more spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that wanted to target overseas consumers.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Meta's revenue and EPS to increase at CAGRs of 14% and 21%, respectively. That outlook is bright and its stock seems reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings, but its big investors might be worried about a slowdown in spending from its Chinese advertisers and tougher competitive headwinds in the advertising market.\n\nShould investors follow suit?\n\nHedge fund managers have different priorities than retail investors. Instead of focusing on long-term multibagger gains over the course of several decades, hedge fund managers tend to focus on generating stable annual returns to satisfy their wealthy clients. To do so, they'll likely trim their winning positions more prudently than growth-oriented retail investors.\n\nSince the end of the first calendar quarter of March 31, Nvidia's stock has rallied 40%. However, Meta's stock has risen less than 1% while Supermicro's stock has declined 13%. So for the short-term investors chasing billionaire trades, selling Nvidia seemed like a mistake but it was smart to follow their lead and take some profits in Meta and Supermicro.\n\nBut if you're a patient long-term investor who plans to hold these AI stocks for at least a few more years, I don't think there's any reason to follow those short-term trades. Nvidia will continue to sell the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Supermicro's share of the AI server market will keep growing, and Meta will continue to use its AI algorithms to craft more effective targeted ads across its social media platforms. Therefore, all three stocks could still generate big multibagger gains for investors who don't get too distracted by the near-term noise and the periodic institutional selling.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "During the mid-1990s, the arrival of the internet opened new doors for corporate America and altered its growth trajectory forever. But for more than a quarter of a century, professional and everyday investors have been pondering which transformative innovation would be next to rival what the internet did for businesses. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be the anointed answer to this long-standing query.\n\nWith AI, software and systems oversee tasks that would previously have been assigned to humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching potential -- PwC believes artificial intelligence can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- is the capacity for software and systems to learn and evolve without human intervention.\n\nAlthough AI stocks have been virtually unstoppable over the last 18 months, a shift in AI euphoria may be brewing, with Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) being the culprit behind it. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's operating ramp has been virtually flawless\n\nBefore I dig into the negatives, let's give credit where credit is due. Semiconductor titan Nvidia was able to harness its first-mover advantage to become the leading provider of graphics processing units (GPUs) in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nBased on an analysis from the researchers at TechInsights, Nvidia accounted for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million GPUs that were shipped to enterprise data centers last year. For those of you wondering, this represents a cool 98% market share.\n\nOn top of its first-mover advantage, Nvidia holds clear-cut compute advantages over its competition. While Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) are attempting to play catch-up to Nvidia's in-demand H100 GPU, Nvidia is readying to roll out its next-generation GPU architecture, known as Blackwell. In June, CEO Jensen Huang also teased the successor to Blackwell, known as Rubin, which is expected to hit the market in 2026.\n\nThe demand for Nvidia's chips has also overwhelmed their supply. When an in-demand good is in tight supply, it's not unusual for the sales price of said good to meaningfully increase. Nvidia has been able to boost its H100 to (at one point) north of $40,000 per chip. The end result is a notable expansion in the company's adjusted gross margin to 78.35% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nThe AI revolution has lifted Nvidia's shares by 706% since the start of 2023, which has boosted its market cap by more than $2.7 trillion. It's this historic scaling from one of Wall Street's most influential businesses that compelled the company's board to complete a 10-for-1 stock split in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia's glory days may prove to be short-lived.\n\nNvidia's own forecast is an ominous warning of challenges to come\n\nNo matter how high the bar has been set, Nvidia has hurdled Wall Street's revenue and profit forecasts in each of the previous five quarters. But the company's adjusted gross margin forecast for the fiscal second quarter provides an ominous warning for Wall Street and investors that shouldn't be ignored.\n\nNvidia's second-quarter guidance calls for its adjusted gross margin to come in at 75.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This would mark a 235 to 335 basis-point decline from the 78.35% adjusted gross margin reported in the fiscal first quarter.\n\nIn one respect, a 75.5% adjusted gross margin is about 10 percentage points higher than where things stood in early 2022. A 75% to 76% adjusted gross margin is still phenomenal for a business the size of Nvidia. NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nOn the other hand, this represents the first expected decline in adjusted gross margin since the summer of 2022. More importantly, it looks to be a clear warning that the otherworldly pricing power Nvidia has enjoyed is beginning to dissipate.\n\nIntel and AMD haven't been shy about their desire to chip away at Nvidia's hardware monopoly in enterprise data centers. Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator chip in April, with plans of a ramped up commercial launch during the third quarter. Meanwhile, AMD has been beefing up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is considerably cheaper than the H100 GPU.\n\nAlthough some aspects of the Gaudi 3 and MI300X offer competitive edges over Nvidia's H100, the latter holds a clear-cut compute advantage. The problem for Nvidia is that it's nowhere close to meeting the demand of its customers. As a result, Intel and AMD shouldn't have any trouble finding a strong market for their AI-GPUs in the coming months.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia's top four customers by net sales -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- are internally developing AI-GPUs for their respective data centers.\n\nSimilar to Intel and AMD, these in-house chips are unlikely to rival the compute capacity of Nvidia's H100 or Blackwell architecture. But they are going to take up valuable real estate in AI-accelerated data centers. The development of these AI-GPUs also provides a pretty clear message that America's most influential businesses aim to reduce their reliance on Nvidia's hardware going forward.\n\nThe bulk of Nvidia's growth over the last five quarters can be traced to its pricing power. With Intel and AMD set to flood the market with additional chips, and four \"Magnificent Seven\" companies developing AI chips for internal use, the AI-GPU scarcity that's fueled Nvidia's adjusted margin ramp is going to disappear. Nvidia's forecast decline in adjusted gross margin likely speaks to these pricing pressures, which I believe will only grow stronger in subsequent quarters. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut wait -- there's more\n\nIn addition to Nvidia's own forecast seemingly portending trouble, history hasn't been all that kind to next-big-thing innovations, technologies, and trends.\n\nWhen examined over long periods, some hyped trends have made investors considerably richer (e.g., the internet), while others ended up face-planting (e.g., 3D printing and cannabis stocks). But one thing every single next-big-thing innovation or trend has had in common since the mid-1990s is that they all endured a bubble-bursting event early in their existence.\n\nTo be clear, there's no way to precisely forecast when the music will stop or the euphoria will fade when it comes to a game-changing technology or buzzy trend. But when looking in the rearview mirror, there hasn't been a single instance for three decades where investors didn't overestimate the adoption and/or utility of a new technology or trend.\n\nWhile some investors might be of the opinion that artificial intelligence has the ability to buck this unwritten rule, the reality is that most businesses lack a well-defined blueprint for how AI is going to increase sales and profits. This, by definition, demonstrates an overestimation of adoption and/or utility of this game-changing technology.\n\nI strongly believe there's a path for artificial intelligence to meaningfully improve global productivity and provide consumption-side benefits when looking 10 or 20 years into the future. But over the next year or two, I expect it to become painfully apparent to Wall Street and everyday investors that most businesses have no real plan to generate a return on their AI investments.\n\nWith history as my guide, and Nvidia's guidance as my confirmation, I fully expect the AI bubble to burst sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy for \"One of the Largest Investment Opportunities in Human History,\" According to Certain Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "In June, Swiss investment bank UBS published a report that estimated artificial intelligence (AI) will add $1.2 trillion annually to the global economy by 2027. The analysts divided the AI value chain into three layers:\n\nThe enabling layer includes companies that provide the chips and data center infrastructure needed to train models and build applications. Annual revenue will reach $516 billion by 2027. The intelligence layer includes companies that provide data management tools and AI models that support application development. Annual revenue will reach $255 billion by 2027. The application layer includes companies that use large language models and other machine learning models to build AI products. Annual revenue will reach $395 billion by 2027.\n\nThe report also predicted that \"AI will be the most profound innovation and one of the largest investment opportunities in human history.\" The application layer probably offers the greatest monetization potential over time, but UBS believes companies in the enabling layer will be the biggest beneficiaries during the next three years.\n\nChipmakers Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and server manufacturer Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) fall into that category.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like AI applications. Forrester Research recently wrote, \"Nvidia sets the pace for AI infrastructure worldwide. Without Nvidia GPUs, modern AI wouldn't be possible.\"\n\nNvidia has cemented its leadership and enhanced its ability to monetize AI by branching into other product categories. Its portfolio includes adjacent hardware, like central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as subscription software and cloud services that support AI application development.\n\nToshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs sees that as a key differentiator. \"We believe Nvidia will remain the de facto industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive advantage that spans hardware and software capabilities,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"Nvidia's annual introduction of new products and platforms sets a pace of innovation that keeps it at the forefront of the industry.\"\n\nWall Street expects Nvidia to grow non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share at 38% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 66.7 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this semiconductor stock today.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom provides a broad range of IT solutions, but the company is best known for its leadership in data center networking chips (for switches and routers) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Specifically, Broadcom holds 80% market share in data center networking chips and at\u00a0least 55% market share in ASICs. Demand for AI should be a tailwind in both cases.\n\nSwitches and routers move information between data center servers and other networks, and their ability to do so depends on semiconductor throughput. Due to the enormous amount of data involved, fast chips are essential where AI applications are concerned, and Broadcom has the fastest chips on the market. JPMorgan Chase says spending on data center networking chips will grow 20% to 30% annually over the next few years.\n\nASIC refers to bespoke silicon designed for specialized use cases like AI. For instance, Broadcom helps Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms build custom AI chips, and it recently announced a third (unnamed) customer that could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent ByteDance, according to various analysts. ASICs represent less than 10% of AI chips today, but UBS says the market will outpace GPU sales in the coming years, such that ASICs account for 30% of AI chips by 2027.\n\nWall Street expects Broadcom to grow non-GAAP earnings per share at 21% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends October 2027). That estimate makes its current valuation of 36.7 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a few shares of Broadcom stock today.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer builds high-performance computing platforms for data centers. Its portfolio includes servers and storage systems optimized for use cases like analytics and AI, as well as server management software and server subsystems (chassis, motherboards, power supplies) that can be assembled into complete solutions.\n\nSupermicro is the leader in AI servers, and its market share is climbing due to its in-house manufacturing capabilities and modular approach to product design. To elaborate, the company can quickly build a broad range of servers featuring the latest chips by using common building blocks, and it assembles most of those servers internally in Silicon Valley. That enables rapid prototyping and product roll-out.\n\nIndeed, Supermicro can usually bring new technologies to market before its competitors, often two to six months\u00a0earlier. Hans Mosesmann at Rosenblatt Securities recently highlighted that advantage. \"Super\u00a0Micro has developed a model that is very, very quick to market. They usually have the widest portfolio of products when a new product comes out from Nvidia or AMD or Intel.\"\n\nSupermicro accounted for 10% of AI server sales in 2023, but Bank of America analysts expect that figure to reach 17% by 2026. Tom Blakely at KeyBanc is even more optimistic. He thinks Supermicro could capture a 23% market share in AI servers by 2025. Either way, those forecasts bode well for shareholders. JPMorgan Chase says the AI server market will grow 460% between 2023 and 2027.\n\nWall Street expects Supermicro's non-GAAP earnings per share to increase 41% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends June 2026). That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 42.3 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. As a caveat, investors should watch competitors like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to ensure Supermicro maintains its market share. But I believe Supermicro shareholders will be rewarded with market-beating returns over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Jensen Huang Just Sold Nvidia Stock. Should You?",
        "content": "It's always encouraging when a company's leader buys shares or when the company itself launches a share buyback program. This suggests management is confident about what's ahead, and that may encourage us to get in on the shares, too. When the opposite happens, though, and a chief executive officer sells shares, we might wonder if leadership is losing faith -- and whether we should follow the move.\n\nEarlier this week, the scenario unfolded at one of today's most-talked-about companies: artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Chief executive officer Jensen Huang sold almost $44 million worth of shares from July 15 through July 17, adding to sales earlier in the month. Nvidia stock has soared in recent times, rising nearly 150% in the first half -- and that's after the stock's quadruple-digit increase over the previous five years.\n\nAfter Nvidia's incredible run, should you follow Huang's move and lock in profits? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPutting Huang's decision into context\n\nFirst, it's important to put Huang's decision into context. It came as part of his Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, an agreement allowing insiders to sell a set number of shares at a fixed time. Insiders schedule such transactions at times when they don't hold important news about the company that could potentially spur share movement. All of this means Huang's sale of the 360,000 shares is simply a pre-scheduled transaction and isn't indicative of a particular sentiment about where the stock price is heading.\n\nOn top of this, it's important to note that Huang still holds an enormous number of Nvidia shares even after his recent transactions. As of the company's definitive annual proxy statement, reporting ownership as of March 25, Huang held more than 93 million Nvidia shares.\n\nStill, you may be wondering why Huang is selling shares even on a predetermined basis. We don't know the answer to this. But, considering his enthusiasm about Nvidia's prospects and the growth we've seen at the company so far, it's likely a move to lock in profits here and there -- without impacting the size of his holding by very much.\n\nNow let's get back to our question: Should you follow Huang's move? If you don't yet own Nvidia shares, Huang's transactions aren't a reason to avoid the stock -- as mentioned above, they aren't a sign of troubles or headwinds.\n\nNvidia's track record of growth along with its future prospects make it a great stock to buy and hold for the long term. The company is set to release its Blackwell architecture later this year along with its most powerful chip ever -- demand is surpassing supply, an indication that this new product could supercharge Nvidia's already strong growth. Nvidia also promises to update its chips on an annual basis, a pledge that could ensure the company's AI chip dominance for the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet your investment strategy guide you\n\nBut what if you hold a significant number of Nvidia shares? Should you then lock in profits? This depends on your investment strategy. It's likely Nvidia has a lot of fuel in the tank to power the stock higher in the years to come. But if you have a significant holding and would like to invest in other areas or are seeking to free up cash for other purposes, now is a fine time to follow Huang's move and sell some of your shares.\n\nReducing a holding doesn't necessarily reflect a loss of enthusiasm about a particular stock -- it instead could offer you the funds you need to further diversify your portfolio and score a bigger win over time.\n\nAll of this means that whether you decide to hold on to all of your Nvidia shares or, like Huang, let a few go, this top stock still could play a big role in the growth of your portfolio as the exciting AI story develops.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): Analysts Are Divided. Is It Overvalued?",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA), the leading AI chipmaker in the world, has seen its market value surge 2,742% in the last five years. On the back of these stellar gains, Wall Street analysts are divided on the prospects for Nvidia stock today. While some analysts argue that Nvidia\u2019s valuation is expensive, others make the case that the company still has a long runway to grow, which justifies its premium valuation. I am neutral on the outlook for Nvidia stock, as I believe the current valuation reflects the economic reality facing the company.\n\nAnalyst Optimism on Innovation and Market Dominance\n\nNvidia still has the backing of analysts who believe in its innovation and market competitiveness. For example, Morgan Stanley (MS) recently upgraded its rating on Nvidia and set a price target of $144, citing their confidence in the company\u2019s ability to stay at the top of the AI chip industry.\n\nBlackwell chips, which are faster and more versatile compared to existing AI chips, are expected to attract strong demand from big tech companies, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as these companies accelerate their AI investments.\n\nEach Blackwell chip is expected to be priced between $35,000 and $50,000, contributing positively to Nvidia\u2019s profit margins, given that H100 and H200 chips \u2013 Nvidia\u2019s best-selling products today \u2013 are priced between $25,000 to $40,000.\n\nEdward Jones analysts also pointed out recently that Nvidia\u2019s massive share in the AI chip market and its comfortable lead in the GPU market highlight the company\u2019s competitive advantages.\n\nNvidia has successfully transitioned from a gaming-oriented chip developer to one focused on data centers. This new focus has allowed the company to expand its horizons and cater to the growing demand for data center GPUs. The CUDA platform \u2013 an AI development standard across various domains that allows developers to optimize processor performance while easily creating robust AI applications \u2013 has also been a growth driver in recent times and is expected to contribute positively to Nvidia\u2019s growth in the future.\n\nAccording to many Wall Street analysts, Nvidia\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain engineering talent is also a key differentiator, as it positions the company to be at the forefront of innovation.\n\nConcerns About Growth, Sustainability, and Valuation\n\nThough analysts are generally positive about Nvidia stock, some are questioning the sustainability of earnings growth as well as current valuation levels. For instance, New Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia due to its extended valuation. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu believes there will be limited upside from here unless Nvidia boosts the outlook beyond 2025 meaningfully, which is not likely to happen anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is currently valued at a forward P/E of 47x, which does not scream overvaluation, but this may change if growth decelerates in the foreseeable future.\n\nDA Davidson analyst Gil Luria is bearish on Nvidia, as he believes the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs will decline in the next 18 months as tech giants such as Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) are likely to develop their own chips. Barclays (BCS) analyst Blayne Curtis also noted recently that Nvidia\u2019s long-term outlook is not as rosy as it seems, given that some of its biggest customers are already looking for a solution to reduce their dependency on Nvidia chips.\n\nBeyond Analyst Remarks\n\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, evident from its industry-leading gross margin and leading market share. According to Mizuho Securities, Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips, which gives the company pricing power. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia\u2019s gross margins came to 78% compared to just 41% for Intel (INTC) and 51% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nThese competitive advantages will help Nvidia report strong earnings growth in the next few quarters, but some risks are looming on the horizon. Last November, at the DealBook Summit, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang admitted that he wakes up every morning in fear that the company will fail due to increasing competition.\n\nAMD, with its Radeon Instinct GPUs, is trying to capture a share of the growing data center market, and the company\u2019s acquisition of Xilinx in 2022 has helped it gain traction in the AI and machine learning field. Intel is also making inroads into the data center market with its Habana Gaudi AI processors, which are designed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s data center GPUs.\n\nThe biggest threat to Nvidia\u2019s AI dominance comes from big tech giants who are focused on reducing their reliance on Nvidia\u2019s products.\n\nGoogle, wanting to be self-sufficient when it comes to sourcing advanced AI chips, has developed an in-house AI chip series called Tensor Processing Units. These chips are already used in Google\u2019s data centers. Amazon has also developed its own AI chips called Inferentia and Trainium, targeting AWS customers who use Nvidia GPUs for AI applications. In addition to these tech giants, Microsoft and Meta have also announced investments in their own AI chips.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nBased on the ratings of 41 Wall Street analysts, NVDA stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with 37 Buy ratings and four Holds. The average Nvidia stock price target is $140.85, which implies upside potential of 11.5% from the current market price.\n\nThe Takeaway: Nvidia Seems Reasonably Valued\n\nNvidia is enjoying competitive advantages, which justifies the premium valuation it trades at. However, competition in the AI chip market is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years, with rival chipmakers and big tech companies aggressively investing in AI chips to grab a share of this booming market. Because of this looming threat, Nvidia seems fairly valued today, with no margin of safety to attract new investors at the current stock price.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "What's Going On With Intel Stock On Friday?\n\nU.S. Chips Act beneficiary Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) had a positive week till Thursday, while Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 5% and 15%, respectively.\n\nOn Wednesday, the broader semiconductor sector lost over $500 billion in stock market value as reports indicated that the U.S. is intensifying its advanced semiconductor embargo against China.\n\nThis was followed by Presidential candidate Donald Trump attacking global contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM). Investors leveraged the opportunity for profit booking.\n\nNow, let us take a look at the positive pointers for Intel. Last week, reports indicated Intel CTO Greg Lavender targeting $1 billion in software and developer cloud subscription revenue, possibly reaching this before 2027.\n\nIn 2021, Intel generated over $100 million in software revenue after CEO Pat Gelsinger recruited Lavender from VMware.\n\nLavender expects Intel\u2019s upcoming Gaudi 3 chip to help it secure a strong position in the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia leads the AI accelerator market with a share of 70% \u2013 95%, as per Mizuho Securities. Intel expects the Gaudi 3 chip to generate $500 million in revenue in late 2024. Morgan Stanley expects the total Gaudi shipment in 2025 to generate $2 billion\u2014$3 billion in revenue for Intel.\n\nIntel and AMD are competing for dominance in the AI PC market.\n\nIntel aims to ship chips for over 100 million AI PCs by 2025, including over 40 million in 2024.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, DNB Asset Management, which manages approximately $88 billion in assets, made notable adjustments to its U.S.-traded big tech holdings. They reduced their stake in Nvidia and more than doubled its investment in Intel.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Intel processors accounted for 64% of all x86 CPU tests, while AMD processors made up 33%, as per Statista. Focusing on laptop CPUs, Intel dominated with 75% of benchmark test results for the same period.\n\nIntel trades at a forward P/E multiple of 32.57 versus AMD at 45.46 and Nvidia at 46.3, as it lacks the AI chip moat due to a decade of underinvestment leading to a technology gap as per Forbes.\n\nIntel\u2019s Price/Sales of 2.67 is a stark contrast to AMD at 11.15 and Nvidia at 37.85. Intel stock lost over 2% in the last three months, above 24% in the last 6 months.\n\nIntel has a consensus price target of\u00a0$39.82 based on 33 analysts\u2019 ratings. The\u00a0most recent analyst rating was on July 16, when Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C J Muse reiterated Intel with a Neutral rating and a $40\u00a0price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts noted that Intel is experiencing a slow recovery in its PC and data center segments. Customers are delaying server demand recovery, prioritizing AI infrastructure over traditional servers.\n\nPrice Action: INTC shares are down 5.10% at $33.09 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nINTEL (INTC): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Intel Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday?\n\nARM Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) shares are trading higher after Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson upgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised its price target from $107 to $190.\n\nThe upgrade comes as the broader semiconductor sector has seen a selloff this week following Donald Trump\u2019s verbal attack against contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S.\u2019s plans to intensify advanced semiconductor sanctions against China.\n\nAI chip stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 9% and 18% this week.\n\nAt the Computex forum in Taipei, Arm CEO Rene Haas said he expects 100 billion Arm devices worldwide to be AI-ready by the end of 2025.\n\nArm Holdings plans to showcase its AI chip in 2025 and launch it commercially by fall 2025. Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm\u2019s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world\u2019s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm\u2019s major customers.\n\nArm\u2019s clients choose the company over Intel Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm\u2019s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm\u2019s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of\u00a0$112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "A staggering national deficit will likely need America's leaders to brainstorm ways to address it.\n\nBut is introducing and enforcing an unrealized capital gains tax \u2014 as President Biden has suggested he would do \u2014 the proper approach?\n\nTo outspoken economist and author Stephen Moore, it\u2019s more than a bad idea. If introduced, it\u2019s an excuse for investors to \"run for the high grass,\" Moore told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see the video above or listen here.)\n\nMoore is no stranger to how tax policies evolve under political and administrative changes. He helped former President Donald Trump write his tax cut plan in 2016. He remains an economic adviser to Trump and is a senior visiting fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nAt present, the capital gains tax only applies to an asset when it is sold. Under Biden\u2019s proposed plan, a 25% unrealized capital gains tax would apply to taxpayers with a net worth above $100 million, even if they do not sell them.\n\nThat essentially means that come tax time, investors would owe money on assets they're holding on to long term if they appreciated in value.\n\nAdditionally, the regular capital gains tax rate would rise from 24% to 40% and intends to target corporations and high-net-worth individuals to ensure they pay their \u201cfair share\u201d as Biden likes to say.\n\nBut experts beyond Moore have cried foul as it could stunt investing in public markets and possibly private markets.\n\nVenture capitalist heavyweight Marc Andreessen cited the proposed tax as a \u201cfinal straw\u201d in an interview with TechCrunch (a sister publication to Yahoo Finance), sending him to enthusiastically back team Trump.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a venture firm, you\u2019re getting strips of your portfolio pulled away from you every year. You\u2019re out of business,\u201d Andreessen told TechCrunch. \u201cThis makes startups completely implausible.\u201d\n\nBlackrock's CEO Larry Fink doesn't think tax hikes of any kind are what the country needs right now.\n\n\"We can\u2019t see debt as a problem that can be solved only through taxing and spending cuts anymore. Instead, America\u2019s debt efforts have to center around pro-growth policies, which include tapping the capital markets to build one of the best catalysts for growth: Infrastructure. Especially energy infrastructure,\" Fink said in his latest annual shareholder letter.\n\nBut while accountants could count themselves among the potentially lucky bunch under such policies, for Moore, they are \u201cgoing to depress the stock market,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you raise the tax on stocks, then the value of the stocks goes down.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024.

        "title": "Do More U.S. Restrictions on China Make AMD a Risky Bet?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have declined more than 14% in the past week. The chipmaker's shares suffered heavy losses following a Bloomberg news that the U.S. government is reportedly planning to tighten restrictions on chip exports to China. The United States already prohibits the sale of high-end chips above a certain capability threshold in China.\r\n\r\nAMD shares declined 10.2% on Jul 17 on the heels of the Bloomberg report. It further declined by 2.3% to close at $155.77 on Jul 18. Year to date, AMD shares have gained 5.7%, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 20.8%.\r\n\r\nThe Biden administration\u2019s tightening plan sent shockwaves throughout the semiconductor industry. Apart from AMD, shares of NVIDIA NVDA, Micron Technology MU, Marvell Technology MRVL and ASML dropped 7.09%, 6.3%, 10.1% and 12.7%, respectively, on Jul 17. On Jul 18, while both NVIDIA and Marvell shares recovered slightly, both MU and ASML continued their drop along with AMD.\r\n\r\nAmong these semiconductor bellwethers, Marvell has the most exposure to China, 45% of total revenues, followed by ASML, NVIDIA and AMD, generating roughly 41%, 20% and 15% of revenues, respectively. Micron generates close to 10% of revenues from China. (Read More: Chip Stocks Tumble as US Plans to Tighten China Restrictions).\n\nYear-to-Date Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD Stock Suffers From Stiff Competition\n\nAMD is suffering from stiff competition from NVIDIA. Both stocks have been the darlings of investors, driven by the massive proliferation of AI that has created a strong demand for GPU chips required to power AI models.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, the challenging macroeconomic environment and rising uncertainties over the upcoming Presidential elections don\u2019t bode well for AMD stock, given its smaller size and GPU market share. These factors have also made investors skeptical of its ability to dethrone NVIDIA. \r\n\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s strategy to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline intensifies competition for AMD. \r\n\r\nAMD\u2019s near-term prospects further suffer from weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments. \r\n\r\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year over year. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenues are expected to be flat, while the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Embedded revenues is currently pegged at $845.89 million, indicating a 45.7% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming is pegged at $657.24 million, suggesting a massive 165.4% decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimate Revisions Witnessing Upward Movement\n\nAMD expects second-quarter 2024 revenues to be $5.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 6% and sequential growth of approximately 4%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.71 billion, indicating 6.54% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 67 cents per share, up a penny over the past 30 days.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\n\nAMD\u2019s Robust Portfolio Aids Long-Term Prospects\n\nAMD\u2019s long-term prospects are bright, given robust spending on AI chips.\r\n\r\nGartner expects revenues from AI semiconductors to hit $71.25 billion in 2024, up 33% over 2023. For 2025, revenues are expected to reach $91.96 billion, up roughly 29% over the 2024 estimate. More importantly, in 2024, AI chips revenue from compute electronics is projected to total $33.4 billion, which will account for 47% of total AI semiconductors revenue. \r\n\r\nThis bodes well for AMD as its portfolio expansion initiatives are making it well-positioned in the data center market as well as in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\r\n\r\nNew offerings like the Instinct MI325X accelerator are helping to expand AMD\u2019s footprint in the data center market. AMD has launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\r\n\r\nAMD is also benefiting from its strong partner base. At Computex, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\r\n\r\nThe recently announced Silo AI acquisition expands AMD\u2019s AI ecosystem. The company has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem. In the past 12 months, it has spent $125 million on a dozen of acquisitions. Nod.ai and Mipsology are some other notable acquisitions in the recent past.\n\nAMD Stock Overvalued\n\nAMD\u2019s Value Style Score of F indicates a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nAMD stock is trading at a premium to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Its forward 12-month P/E of 35.54X is higher than the industry\u2019s 34.56X.\n\nP/E Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD\u2019s near-term prospects are dull, given the weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments amid stiff competition from NVIDIA. AMD has a Growth Style Score of D, which makes the stock unattractive for growth-oriented investors.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. However, investors who already own the stock may expect the company's growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.

        "title": "4 Solid Stocks to Gain From as Bitcoin Resumes Bull Run",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency rally that began in 2023 and continued into the first quarter came to a sudden halt in April. Bitcoin (BTC) particularly has been in focus as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency witnessed an unprecedented rise at the beginning of this year.\n\nThe rally gathered pace in the second half of January, days after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a historic move that will allow both retail and institutional investors a regulated and accessible way to invest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nOn Mar 14, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,750. However, the crypto rally stalled after that. Even the Bitcoin halving event in April, which takes place once in four years, failed to boost the price of the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half, aiming to cap the total number of Bitcoins at 21 million. This decrease in the rate at which new Bitcoins are created boosts demand for the cryptocurrency, often leading to a rise in its price.\n\nBitcoin has since been on the decline, with the price falling to $53,513 at the end of June. However, Bitcoin defied the bearish trend and started rebounding last week. On Jul 18, Bitcoin was trading above $63,500.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has jumped 5.2% after declining 1.6% in the past month.\n\nNeedless to say, Bitcoin still has a lot of potential, with the cryptocurrency gaining 157% in 2023 and 51.3% year to date.\n\nA number of factors are responsible for Bitcoin\u2019s recent surge. The unsuccessful assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump has made investors increase their bets on the chances of Trump winning the election in November.\n\nTrump is also believed to be more welcoming to the crypto industry and his campaign has started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced in June that the central bank now plans to cut interest rates only once this year, instead of the three cuts previously expected.\n\nHowever, even a single 25 basis point rate cut has been well-received, especially since many had thought that there would be no rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe latest FOMC \"dot plot\" indicates a projected total 1% decrease in interest rates by 2025, potentially taking the Fed funds rate to 4.1% by the end of next year.\n\nMarkets are now expecting a rate cut in September, which could benefit the cryptocurrency market. Lower interest rates usually help growth-oriented assets like technology stocks, consumer goods and cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have narrowed our search to four crypto-oriented stocks that have strong potential for 2024. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.

        "content": "Polen Capital, an investment management company, released its \u201cPolen Focus Growth Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.11% (gross) and -0.31% (net) compared to 8.33% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 4.28% for the S&P 500 Index. Generative AI (GenAI) remains the dominant market narrative in the second quarter. The portfolio does not own NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies that are presently benefitting from the demand for AI hardware. However, with the portfolio\u2019s extensive investment in software and IT services, the firm anticipates that GenAI's long-term economic gains will go to these industries. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) offers graphics and compute and networking solutions. The one-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -7.41%, and its shares gained 166.01% of their value over the last 52 weeks.\u00a0On July 18, 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $121.09 per share with a market capitalization of $2.979 trillion.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"In the second quarter, the dominant narrative in markets continued to be generative AI (GenAI). If it wasn't immediately evident from NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) meteoric rise to among the largest companies in the world, one need only look so far as the Semiconductor and Technology Hardware industries as a gauge of sentiment, collectively accounting for greater than 70% of the Russell 1000 Growth (\"the Index\") and 85% of the S&P 500 headline return quarter to date.\n\nOur Portfolio has no exposure to NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies currently benefiting from demand for foundational AI Hardware. The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple, and Salesforce.\n\nFor the second quarter in a row, NVIDIA represented the top detractor to relative performance as the stock climbed another 37%, bringing the year-to-date return to +150%. As of this writing, NVIDIA is the third largest company in the world, but for a brief moment, it surpassed Microsoft to become the largest company in the world. Yet again, the company delivered blowout results that surpassed already lofty expectations, reinforcing the narrative that NVIDIA is the only obvious \"AI winner\" due to the amount of revenue it is currently generating\u2026\u201d (Click here to rad the full text)\n\nStory continues\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in 5th position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

        "title": "Generac, and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013July 19, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Generac GNRC, as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global Holdings HTZ, asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Generac is a company that designs and manufactures power generation equipment and other engine-powered products. Its primary focus is on backup power solutions, including residential, commercial and industrial generators. Generac also produces portable generators, pressure washers, transfer switches, and other power-related products. The company\u2019s offerings ensure reliable power during outages and serve various energy needs across different sectors, emphasizing innovation, reliability, and efficiency in power management.\n\nUnusually Active Hurricane Season Predicted\n\nHurricane experts are forecasting an abnormally strong hurricane season with more than twenty named storms likely to form from now until end of the year. Warm ocean temperatures are the main ingredient needed for devastating hurricanes. Forecasters believe that out of the named storms up to seven will be classified as \u201cmajor hurricanes.\u201d\n\nStronger hurricanes spurred on by climate change are contributing to Generac\u2019s bottom line and are likely to do so well into the future. Beyond hurricanes, the United States power grid has displayed in vulnerability in recent years. For example, Houston, Texas residents recently lost power for several days. More and more these multi-day outages are becoming common place in states like Florida, Texas, and California. Fortunately for investors, GNRC has the remedy.\n\nRelative Price Strength\n\nOn Wall Street, strength tends to beget strength. Said alternatively, the trend is your friend until the end when it bends. That\u2019s good news for GNRC shareholders. The stock has doubled the performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past six months and the momentum is only likely to continue as hurricane season arrives.\n\nA Stealth AI Energy Play\n\nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has caused a spurt in the construction of energy-intensive data centers. This is likely to spur demand for power consumption/backup power in the near future, which is expected to put pressure on the aging power grids.\n\nBottom Line\n\nHurricanes seem to be more prevalent than ever before. Backup power generation firm Generac is set to cash in.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Hertz Global Holdings is a multinational company primarily engaged in the car rental industry. As one of the world\u2019s largest car rental providers, Hertz operates in over 150 countries, offering rental services for a wide range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and SUVs.\r\n\r\nThe company caters to both leisure and business travelers, providing short-term and long-term rental solutions. In addition to car rentals, Hertz has expanded its services to include equipment rental and fleet management solutions. Hertz is known for its extensive fleet of vehicles and a global network of rental locations, making it a prominent player in the transportation sector.\n\nPoor Fleet Allocation\n\nRecently, Hertz announced it would cut its TeslaEV fleet by 20,000 vehicles, or roughly 33%. Surprisingly, Hertz could not turn a profit renting out the wildly popular TSLA EVs. The failed EV fleet acquisition underscores car rental industry issues, including, poor visibility, weak economics, and tight margins.\n\nEarnings Growth is Moving in the Wrong Direction\n\nIn bull markets (and any market for that matter), investors gravitate towards companies with strong and positive earnings growth. Unfortunately for Hertz investors, HTZ EPS has been declining for several quarters.\n\nTo make matters worse, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest -184.62% earnings growth for the current quarter and -24% for full-year 2024.\n\nIndustry Disruption\n\nBlockbuster Video\u2019s management team famously scoffed at the idea of sending DVDs in the mail (and later streaming) and refused to acquire Netflix. The rest is history \u2013 Blockbuster went bust, and NFLX went on to have a meteoric rise and become a Wall Street darling.\n\nUnfortunately for Hertz, innovation is beginning to disrupt the industry. Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that allows individuals to rent out their personal vehicles to others. The platform connects car owners with people in need of short-term rentals, providing a diverse selection of cars to choose from. Turo offers an alternative to traditional car rental services, allowing for a more varied and unique selection of vehicles.\r\n\r\nBoth car owners and renters can benefit from the flexibility and convenience provided by Turo\u2019s platform, often offering users a more personalized and local experience. I like to think of it as Airbnb, but for cars. While Turo may not be in a position to put HTZ out of business, the platform is beginning to disrupt the industry and acts as a negative tailwind.\n\nRelative Weakness\n\nHertz price action matches its sinking fundamental picture. While most stocks uptrend and soar to new heights, HTZ shares are stuck in the mud. Investors should avoid relatively weak stocks such as HTZ.\n\nBottom Line\n\nHertz is struggling from poor economics, industry disruption, and low visibility. Avoid laggards such as HTZ.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nChip Stocks Tumble as U.S. Plans to Tighten China Restrictions\n\nIn a significant development for the semiconductor industry, the Biden administration is reportedly planning to tighten restrictions on chip exports to China. This news, first reported by Bloomberg citing people familiar with the matter, has sent shockwaves through the market.\n\nFollowing the Bloomberg report, shares of major semiconductor companies took a nosedive, with NVIDIA Corp., Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and Marvell Technology, Inc.\n\nThe Biden Administration's Plan\n\nThe proposed measures are part of a broader strategy to curb China's access to advanced semiconductor technology, which is deemed critical for both commercial and military applications. The U.S. government aims to maintain technological superiority and safeguard national security interests by tightening export controls.\n\nCiting the sources, Bloomberg revealed that a key component of this plan involves the Foreign Direct Product Rule (\u201cFDPR\u201d), a regulation first introduced in 1959 that allows the United States to control the sale of products made using American technology, regardless of where they are manufactured.\n\nThis provision could be applied to companies such as Tokyo Electron and ASML Holding NV, which play crucial roles in the global semiconductor supply chain. According to the Bloomberg report, the Biden administration has been discussing this measure with allies in Tokyo and The Hague, emphasizing the potential for its implementation if these countries do not tighten their restrictions on China.\n\nImpact on US Chip Makers\n\nThe restrictions under discussion could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. semiconductor industry. Companies like NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell, which have significant exposure to the Chinese market, are likely to feel a significant impact. China is a major consumer of semiconductors, accounting for a substantial portion of global demand. Any disruption in this market can lead to substantial revenue losses for these companies.\n\nNVIDIA is already witnessing the heat of earlier bans on selling its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. The country usually accounted for more than 20% of its total revenues. However, from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 onward, China\u2019s contribution to NVIDIA\u2019s total revenues has dropped to the high-single-digit range.\n\nMarvell has a larger exposure to the Chinese market from where it generates around 45% of its total revenues. For Advanced Micro Devices, China accounted for 15% of its 2023 total revenues.\n\nThe broader implications of these restrictions extend beyond individual companies. The semiconductor industry is highly interconnected, with complex global supply chains. Any disruption in one part of the chain can have cascading effects on the entire industry. The heightened restrictions could lead to supply-chain disruptions, increased production costs, and delays in product development and delivery.\n\nMoreover, these restrictions could accelerate China's efforts to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency. The Chinese government has been investing heavily in its domestic semiconductor industry to reduce dependence on foreign technology. While this transition will take time, the new restrictions could provide additional impetus for China to expedite its semiconductor development initiatives.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe tightening of chip access restrictions on China is set to have profound implications for U.S. chip makers' long-term growth prospects. Companies like NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell have seen their valuations skyrocket over the past year, driven by the booming demand for AI and advanced computing technologies. These optimistic projections have fueled significant investor enthusiasm, with expectations of explosive growth in revenues and market share.\n\nHowever, the recent plunge in these chip stocks, spurred by the Biden administration's plans to impose stricter export controls, highlights the fragility of this optimism. Investors now seem to be increasingly concerned that these companies may face substantial headwinds due to the enhanced restrictions on chip exports to China, a critical market for their products. The potential disruption in supply chains, coupled with limited access to a lucrative market, poses a significant risk to the growth trajectories of these semiconductor giants.\n\nCurrently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices and Marvell each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Best-Performing Sector of the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The real estate sector has been one of the worst-performing parts of the stock market recently. Although the S&P 500 is up by 50% since the start of 2023, rebounding nicely from the 2022 bear market lows, the real estate sector, as indicated by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ), is up by just 6% in the same period. Even including dividends, real estate has underperformed the S&P 500 by 37 percentage points over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile this has certainly not been a fun time to be a real estate investment trust (REIT) investor, there's good reason to believe that things are about to turn around. With that in mind, here's why real estate has performed so poorly as a sector, why things might be about to get better for REITs, and why now could be a great time to get some exposure.\n\nWhy has the real estate sector performed so poorly?\n\nThe biggest reason real estate has underperformed is the rising-rate environment of the past couple years.\n\nWithout getting too deep into an economics lesson, the key point to know is that when risk-free interest rates rise (Treasury securities, for example), it tends to put pressure on income-oriented investments like REITs. Think of it this way: When instruments like Treasuries pay more, the yields investors expect from \"riskier\" investments tend to rise as well. Since yield and price have an inverse relationship, rising yields put downward pressure on REIT prices, even when the underlying business is doing well.\n\nNot only do rising rates generally put pressure on income-focused investments, but they also make it more expensive to borrow money. While this can affect businesses in all sectors, REITs tend to be more reliant than most on debt to grow their business, similar to how most homeowners use a mortgage when buying a home.\n\nIt also hasn't helped that the surge in AI investment has caused investor sentiment to shift in favor of massive tech stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). We've already started to see some money rotate out of the high-flying AI winners and into income-based stocks like REITs just based on recent inflation data, and this could accelerate once the Federal Reserve actually starts to cut rates.\n\nLast but certainly not least, we've seen some headwinds specific to certain property types. One big example is the communications REITs: American Tower(NYSE: AMT) and Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI). Both are experiencing a challenging growth environment, and since they're both among the largest REITs, they have a disproportionate drag on the index. Plus, some sectors have dealt with oversupply headwinds, such as office and self-storage real estate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould a major turnaround be right around the corner?\n\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't raised interest rates in 2024, but investor expectations have certainly changed. At the beginning of the year, the median expectation was for a total of six rate cuts in 2024, but the inflation data and Fed officials quickly told a different story. And that's the biggest reason why real estate has underperformed so far this year.\n\nHowever, the latest inflation data indicates that it might actually be time for the Fed to start seriously considering rate cuts. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the first rate cut is clearly expected in September, a total of three are expected by the end of the year, and the median expectation is now for six total cuts by July 2025. In other words, the falling-rate cycle is set to begin -- just a little later than originally anticipated.\n\nAs rates fall, investor money could start to flow out of risk-free instruments like Treasuries, money market funds, and savings accounts, and into high-yielding stocks like REITs. And if the recent market activity is any indicator, we could also see a bit of a rotation out of the high-flying megacap tech stocks that have largely led the market's performance.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but...\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there's no way to know for sure how REITs will perform for the rest of 2024 and beyond, or if the Fed will actually start cutting interest rates. If inflation data for the next few months doesn't look great, it's entirely possible rates could stay higher for longer than expected.\n\nHaving said that, investing in REITs when the real estate sector is down by 25% from its all-time high, as it is now, has historically been a very strong entry point for long-term investors. There are some excellent values in individual REITs right now, but if you'd rather get broad exposure to the sector to hold for the long run, an ETF like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF could be a fantastic addition to your long-term portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Real Estate ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Real Estate ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard Real Estate ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Today\u2019s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores the recent stock market selloff, and why the healthy selling represents a wonderful opportunity for investors. The episode then turns its attention to three highly-ranked Zacks tech stocks\u2014Spotify Technology S.A. (SPOT), Shopify (SHOP), and Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT)\u2014trading at least 20% below their highs to consider buying before earnings.\n\nThe Nasdaq\u2019s mid-week tumble sent it below its 21-day moving average for the first time in months. Massive selling across semiconductors and other standout 2024 growth areas fueled the fall, with Nvidia, Taiwan Semi, Constellation Energy, and others leading the way lower.\n\nThe Nasdaq fell 0.7% on Thursday, as Wall Street continued to take profits from stocks that are still up 30%, 40%, 50%, or more YTD. A healthy pullback was needed and the Nasdaq is still trading solidly above its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if Nvidia and other large-cap tech stocks get a bit more of a haircut in the coming days and weeks. Thankfully, the selling likely sets up a strong rally in the back half of the year since the market desperately needed a cooldown, with the Nasdaq already down from heavily overbought RSI levels to below neutral.\n\nInvestors who can stomach the possibility of more near-term selling and volatility should start buying great stocks on sale right now.\n\nSpotify Technology S.A. (SPOT) Stock \u2013 Q2 2024 Earnings July 23\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) changed the music industry forever and it is thriving amid competition from Apple and a few other tech titans. SPOT grew its monthly active users by 19% YoY in Q1 to 615 million, with paid Premium Subscribers up 14% to 239 million.\n\nSpotify in June announced its second set of price hikes in the last year-plus to match its rivals, keep up with inflation, and boost profits. Spotify has also streamlined its business, helping it reach a potential inflection point for profits. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nSpotify\u2019s adjusted earnings outlook has skyrocketed over the past 12 months, up 723% for FY24 and 215% for FY25, landing it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Spotify is projected to grow its revenue by 18% in 2024 and 15% in FY25, doubling its sales in five years. Spotify is also projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$2.95 a share last year to +$5.02 in 2024 and surge another 44% next year.\n\nSpotify\u2019s impressive earnings outlook is helping improve its valuation levels. Spotify is trading around 13% below its early June highs and over 20% below its 2021 records. Any pullback to SPOT\u2019s 200-day moving average would mark a fantastic buying opportunity for Spotify.

        "title": "Blackwell Demand to Benefit Both Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. Is It Time to Buy Both Stocks?",
        "content": "According to recent reports out of Taiwan, the demand for graphic processing units (GPUs) based on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) next-generation Blackwell architecture is so robust that the chipmaker has increased its Blackwell orders at its primary semiconductor contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, by 25%.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the demand for Blackwell chips and the impact it could have on both Nvidia and TSMC.\n\nInsatiable demand for Blackwell\n\nA report from Taiwan's Economic Daily News indicates that TSMC is soon about to start Blackwell GPU production using its 4-nanometer technology and that due to customer demand, Nvidia increased its order by 25%. The publication also states that demand for Nvidia terminal server cabinets also surged, with shipments now expected to rise to 60,000 units, up from a prior estimate of 40,000. Most of the terminal shipments are expected to be Nvidia's GB200 NVL36 model, which includes 36 GB200 Superchips, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs, at a cost of around $1.8 million.\n\nThe news follows analyst reports from earlier this month that channel check data -- independent stock analysis that examines a company's distribution channels --\u00a0was indicating very robust demand for Blackwell-based chips and rack-scale systems. Analysts from UBS, Keybanc, and Wolfe Research all cited stronger-than-expected Blackwell demand as reasons for raising their Nvidia price targets.\n\nUBS took its target from $120 to $150, believing the chipmaker could generate $5 in earnings per share next year. Keybanc, meanwhile, raised its target price from $130 to $180, believing the company could generate $200 billion in data center revenue in 2025. Wolfe upped its target from $125 to $150 saying its sees 50% or more GPU growth for the company.\n\nWhile channel check data\u00a0is not perfect, where there is smoke there tends to be fire, and with so many sources citing strong Blackwell demand and cloud computing companies racing to build out artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, it seems pretty safe to say that demand for Blackwell GPUs and rack-scale systems does indeed look insatiable.\n\nGiven this, both Nvidia and TSMC look poised to show very strong growth next year.\n\nCan investors still buy Nvidia and TSMC stock?\n\nShares of both Nvidia and TSMC have had strong runs. TSMC stock is up over 300% the past five years, while Nvidia stock is up over 2,500%, which is just incredible. However, both stocks are still reasonably valued. Nvidia currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 43 times, while TSMC trades at about 27 times. Given their strong growth prospects, these multiples are not expensive.\n\nStory continues NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIn fact, investments in these stocks are both bets that the demand for GPUs to help build out AI infrastructure will continue to grow strongly. With Nvidia looking to push its architecture innovation to about once a year, demand and pricing should remain strong well into the future.\n\nNvidia is already working on its successor to Blackwell, called Rubin, which it plans to launch late next year. The company has a wide moat due to its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, so together with its continual innovation push, I don't see any company threatening its leadership position anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, should continue to benefit from Nvidia's success and the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout, as well as competitors chasing Nvidia and looking to develop their own GPUs. The company also looks poised to take some price hikes, while it continues to improve its production technology. It is looking to move down to 2-nanometer production technology, which will allow for increased speed and lower power consumption of the chips. Smaller chips also allow more to be put onto a wafer, saving costs and increasing capacity.\n\nTSMC's largest customer, Apple, has reportedly already been planning to lock up all its 2-nanometer production capacity, which shows that the company is not just riding Nvidia's coattails. With companies battling it out to get capacity and use TSMC's latest technology, the company finds itself in a strong position moving forward.\n\nAll in all, the Blackwell demand news helps counter the argument that AI chip demand could evaporate after the initial rush of orders. With this risk seemingly off the table for now, this looks like a great opportunity to buy both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Chip-Related Stocks to Buy After Export Restriction Fear Sparks Sell-Off",
        "content": "Semiconductor stocks sold off recently after Bloomberg came out with a report that the U.S. was looking to enact tighter export restrictions to keep China from gaining access to advanced chip technology. The report noted that the restrictions would extend to foreign semiconductor equipment manufacturers that use U.S. technology, such as ASML and Tokyo Electron, as well.\n\nInvestor worries only intensified as former President Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to office, said that Taiwan should pay for its own military defense. Taiwan manufactures over 90% of the world's advanced chips, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association, and China considers the autonomously governed island as its territory.\n\nWhile these reports add risk to the space, they often tend to be noise more than anything else. With the boom in artificial intelligence (AI) chips, companies in the space have a long runway to grow without shipping advanced chips or equipment to China.\n\nLet's look at three stocks to consider following this sell-off. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nAs the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom to date, any sell-off in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) looks like a buying opportunity at this point. The company has seen its sales skyrocket over demand for its graphic processing units (GPUs), which are being used to build out the infrastructure that powers AI applications. Meanwhile, analyst channel checks and reports out of Taiwan indicate that demand for its newest chips based on its latest Blackwell architecture is insatiable, with the company looking to gain more production capacity from its contract manufacturers.\n\nAt this point, with Nvidia looking to push innovation and its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform being the de facto software program that developers learn to program on, there appears little threat to its dominant market position in the GPU space. And if AI is still in its early days and the infrastructure buildout continues, then Nvidia still has a lot of growth in front of it.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 43 times based on 2024 estimates and only 32 times based on 2025 estimates, Nvidia's stock is inexpensive, given the growth in front of it and its long-term prospects. As such, this recent sell-off looks like a good buying opportunity. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nWhile Nvidia is the king of GPUs, Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) is the leader in central processor units (CPUs), which act as the brain for computers when performing functions. Unlike Nvidia, it doesn't sell chips, but instead licenses its technology to other semiconductor companies that design their chips based on its architecture. It has also started a subscription service for customers to have broad access to its intellectual property called Arm Total Access.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis has helped lead the company to take a dominant share in the smartphone market, where nearly all smartphones are powered by chips using its technology. With the advent of AI, the company could be set to benefit from a nice smartphone upgrade cycle, as users scramble to upgrade their smartphones to be able to run the latest AI applications.\n\nHowever, Arm also set its sights on other markets as well. The company is making a big push into the personal computer (PC) market, with a goal of being in 50% or more of new Windows-based PCs in the next five years. The company is also reportedly looking to set up an AI chip division to help majority owner SoftBank, which owns 90% of the company, built out its data center operations using its chips.\n\nTrading at 99 times 2024 earnings estimates and 74 times 2025 earnings estimates, Arm stock is not cheap. However, its high-margin, licensed business model is extremely attractive, as the company is able to reap the benefits of its design wins for years on end. In fact, the company has boasted that almost half its royalty income comes from Arm products initially released between 1990 and 2012. As such, the recent pullback could be a good time to consider adding a position in the stock. ARM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, is the leading contract manufacturer for semiconductors in the world. While the issues surrounding Taiwan could have a direct impact on the company, given the importance of Taiwan, TSMC specifically, it is in the best interest of the U.S. and its allies to protect Taiwan in any conflict or else face a global catastrophic disruption in the supply of semiconductor chips.\n\nMeanwhile, TSMC is a big beneficiary in the AI chip race, as it supports Nvidia and its competitors producing its chips. The company is building out its own capacity, as well as indicating that it could increase prices.\n\nWith demand currently outstripping supply, especially for its more advanced 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technology, the company is positioned to ride the AI demand wave well into the future. At the same time, it is also pushing into 2-nanometer technology.\n\nTrading at just over 26 times the 2024 earrings consensus and 20 times the 2025 consensus, TSMC looks attractively priced after the recent sell-off. As such, now looks like a good opportunity to buy the stock.

        "title": "Prediction: This Stock Will Benefit Even More Than Nvidia From the AI Boom",
        "content": "When you think of artificial intelligence (AI) winners, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the first to come to mind. The company holds 80% of the AI chip market, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) powering some of the most important workloads out there. Nvidia's earnings have climbed in the triple digits in recent quarters thanks to this dominance, and its stock's performance has followed.\n\nBut my prediction is that another company will benefit even more than Nvidia from the AI boom over the long run. This particular company not only wins when it launches a new product, but it also scores a victory when Nvidia and any of the world's top chip designers release something new.\n\nIn addition, this company has reported soaring earnings in recent years -- and this year, its stock has even been outperforming Nvidia's. It's advanced more than 180%, while Nvidia's climbed 140%. Let's take a closer look at this current and future AI winner. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA 30-year-old business\n\nThe company I'm talking about is Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), a maker of servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions that you'll find throughout AI data centers. Supermicro has been around for more than 30 years, but its business truly took off in recent times, thanks to the AI boom.\n\nFor example, Supermicro's liquid-cooling technology garnered only about 1% market share over most of the company's history. Now, the company expects as much as 30% of all data center operations to use liquid cooling within the coming two years. AI's intense computational power generates significant heat, and this is set to continue as capabilities increase -- but liquid cooling solves the problem.\n\nThe popularity of Supermicro's products and liquid-cooling features have helped revenue to soar. The company recently posted its first $3 billion quarter -- a level of revenue that it reported for a full year as recently as 2021. Demand for its full rack scale solutions continues at record levels, the company has said in its latest earnings report.\n\nAnalysts are expecting the AI market to grow from about $200 billion today to more than $1 trillion by end of the decade, so demand for Supermicro's products is likely to continue climbing.\n\nIncreasing revenue opportunities\n\nBut why could this company benefit even more from the AI boom than Nvidia? Nvidia's revenue opportunities increase every time it releases a new product -- and that's the same for most companies. Supermicro, however, sees its revenue opportunities increase each time the biggest chip companies, such as Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, release a new chip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis happens because Supermicro integrates these chips into its products, creating something new for its customers. To ensure this new wave of revenue happens sooner rather than later, Super Micro works closely with the chipmakers to monitor their release schedules. This way, it's ready to customize products for its customers as quickly as possible.\n\nThis strategy has worked. Supermicro has a growth rate that's five times faster than its industry over the past 12 months.\n\nLooking ahead, the company should benefit as Nvidia releases its new Blackwell architecture and chip, set for later this year. But as mentioned, Supermicro's sales also will climb as other chipmakers launch products, so its fortunes aren't tied to just one chip company. Meanwhile, Nvidia's successes are tied to its ability to remain well ahead of rivals.\n\nThat's why I predict that Supermicro, boosted by growth across a range of major AI players, will benefit more from the AI boom than chip giant Nvidia.\n\nWhat does this mean for investors? If you're looking for a solid long-term AI stock, Supermicro could be a safer bet than Nvidia -- and it's demonstrated its ability to offer returns that are particularly strong.\n\nOn top of that, Supermicro, trading for only 24x forward earnings estimates, compared to 43x for Nvidia, looks dirt cheap, considering its growth so far and what may lie ahead. So now is a great time to get in on this player, which could become one of the biggest winners of the AI growth story.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split: Here Are the 3 Likeliest Candidates to Become Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "We're witnessing something of a rarity on Wall Street at the moment. While it's perfectly normal for investors to be captivated by a next-big-thing technology or trend, it's uncommon for two of these trends to present at the same time.\n\nSince 2024 began, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)and stock-split euphoria have been responsible for driving the market's major indexes to record levels. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an action that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count. Keep in mind that these actions are purely superficial and have no effect on a company's market cap or its underlying operating performance.\n\nAlthough stock splits come in two varieties -- forward and reverse -- investors undeniably gravitate to the former. Whereas reverse-stock splits, which are designed to increase a company's share price, are typically effected from a position of weakness, forward-stock splits are conducted by businesses firing on all cylinders. A forward split aims to make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors and employees.\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2024, around a dozen phenomenal businesses have announced a stock split -- but none have been more impactful or anticipated than that of AI colossus Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia sets the stage for other high-flying stocks to follow\n\nAlthough a handful of high-profile businesses announced their intention to split before Nvidia, including Walmart with its 2-for-1 split and Chipotle Mexican Grill with its historic 50-for-1 forward split, Nvidia's stock split was, by far, the most anticipated.\n\nWith its stock trading near $1,000 per share, Nvidia's board announced a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, which went into effect after the close of trading on June 7.\n\nThe nearly 800% rally (equating to $2.8 trillion in market cap) in Nvidia's stock since the start of 2023 rests entirely on its innovation within AI-driven data centers. Its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) quickly became the go-to chip in high-compute data centers. TechInsights estimates that Nvidia accounted for 98% of the 3.85 million AI GPUs shipped last year.\n\nThe world's leading AI hardware company is also enjoying jaw-dropping pricing power. With demand for AI GPUs easily outpacing supply, Nvidia has been able to dramatically increase the selling price of its chips. The end result has been a 13.8-percentage-point boost in its adjusted gross margin in just the last five quarters (through April 28).\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia has a software advantage that's working in its favor. The company's CUDA platform is a tool kit used by developers that helps them build large language models. Whether it's hardware or software, Nvidia has the tools to keep its customers contained within its ecosystem and loyal to its products.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ingredients were in place for Nvidia to announce a stock split in May. But there are three other companies that appear likely to follow in its footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCostco Wholesale\n\nAs I've previously opined, the most logical candidate to become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is warehouse club retailer Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST). Costco hasn't split its stock since January 2000, and a single share will set investors back close to $843 as of the closing bell on July 12.\n\nThe reasons Costco has outperformed for so long has everything to do with its size and membership-driven operating model.\n\nSimilar to Walmart, Costco is able to use its size and deep pockets to its advantage. Being able to buy products in bulk reduces the per-unit cost of each item. This allows the company to undercut local shops and even national grocery chains on price. At a time when inflation is front-page news, Costco is giving its members a value proposition that few other stores can match.\n\nThe company's membership model is particularly important. Last week, Costco announced plans to increase the annual cost of its base and executive membership fees by $5 and $10, respectively, to $65 and $130. Membership fees generate exceptionally high margins and provide the buffer that allows Costco to undercut competitors on price.\n\nFurthermore, it's only natural for consumers and businesses to want to maximize their membership rewards. This means they're likelier to stay within Costco's ecosystem of products and services when doing their shopping.\n\nFICO\n\nAnother stock that appears likely to mirror Nvidia and conduct a sizable stock split in the not-too-distant future is FICO(NYSE: FICO), the company previously known as Fair Isaac.\n\nFICO's board has approved four stock splits since going public in 1987. However, the company's last split occurred all the way back in March 2004. What's more, each prior split for FICO occurred with its stock priced below $100. As of the closing bell on July 12, a single share of FICO was tipping the scales at almost $1,589!\n\nFICO is the company behind the popular credit scores used to determine the worthiness of prospective borrowers. Although FICO's scores segment remained busy when the Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate at a historically low range of 0% to 0.25%, the true value of the company's solutions has come with the Fed hiking interest rates at the fastest clip in four decades. Economic uncertainty and big changes in monetary policy are what makes FICO's solutions worthwhile to businesses.\n\nFICO's other core operating segment (software) provides various software solutions for companies. This includes analytics and advanced decision-making tools involving customer management, fraud detection, and marketing. The dollar-based net retention rate for FICO's software division was a healthy 112% in the March-ended quarter, which signals that existing clients are spending 12% more this year than they were in the previous year.\n\nEli Lilly\n\nThe third likely candidate to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is the world's largest publicly traded pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY).\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in 1952, Eli Lilly has completed four stock splits, the last of which occurred in October 1997! Although its stock ran in place for about two decades following its last split, a complete revamp of its product portfolio and pipeline has sent its shares into the stratosphere. As of the closing bell on July 12, a single share of Eli Lilly was setting investors back almost $949.\n\nThe primary catalyst behind Eli Lilly's jaw-dropping gains is its glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which include Mounjaro and Zepbound. GLP-1 therapies are a revolutionary new treatment designed to help people lose weight. (Mounjaro is a type 2 diabetes therapy -- occasionally prescribed off-label for weight loss -- that's sold under the brand name Zepbound for weight loss) This is a sizable addressable market, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noting that roughly 42% of American adults are obese. Sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound collectively totaled more than $2.3 billion in the first three months of 2024.\n\nEli Lilly's pipeline is making waves, too. For instance, there's the possibility of label expansion opportunities for tirzepatide, the scientific name for Mounjaro and Zepbound. Positive top-line data from a late-stage readout in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity, coupled with the drug's existing safety profile, suggest considerable sales upside is still to come.\n\nDon't be surprised if Eli Lilly announces a stock split when it releases its second-quarter operating results in August.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia and Broadcom Completed 10-for-1 Stock Splits. History Says the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Do This Next",
        "content": "UBS analysts estimate that artificial intelligence (AI) spending will approach $1.2 trillion annually by 2027. Semiconductor companies Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) have already benefited from that opportunity, and enthusiasm about their ability to monetize AI has driven both stocks higher.\n\nSince November 2022, shares of Nvidia and Broadcom have advanced 765% and 300%, respectively. That period coincides with the existence of ChatGPT, the generative AI application that sparked the spending boom forecasted by UBS.\n\nBoth semiconductor companies recently completed a 10-for-1 stock split, the purpose of which was to make shares more affordable. Historically speaking, stock splits have been good news for shareholders. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHistory says Nvidia and Broadcom shares will move higher by mid-2025\n\nIn hindsight, good investments often share two qualities: The companies in question have a competitive advantage and compelling growth prospects. In some cases, those qualities lead to share-price appreciation so significant that a company splits its stock. That rarely happens by accident to poor or mediocre companies. In that sense, stock splits can be roundabout indicators of worthwhile investments.\n\nResearch from Bank of America supports that conclusion. Companies tend to outperform the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the year following a stock-split announcement, according to analysts at the investment bank. \"Historically, stocks have notched 25% total returns in the 12 months after a split is announced, compared to 12% for the broad index.\"\n\nWe can apply that information to Nvidia and Broadcom to make an educated guess about their future performance.\n\nNvidia announced its 10-for-1 stock split after market close on May 22, 2024. Its share price has increased 16% since the opening bell on the following day, leaving implied upside of 9% through May 2025. Broadcom announced its 10-for-1 stock split after market close on June 12, 2024. Shares have declined 9% since the opening bell on the following day, leaving implied upside of 34% through June 2025.\n\nPast performance is never a guarantee of future results, but history says there are more gains in store for Nvidia and Broadcom shareholders in the coming months. Coincidentally, Wall Street analysts have come to a similar conclusion. Nvidia's median 12-month price target of $132 per share implies 13% upside from its current share price of $118. And Broadcom's median 12-month price target of $200 per share implies 28% upside from its current share price of $156.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, relying too heavily on predictions and price targets is dangerous. Warren Buffett once wrote, \"Short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place.\" Rather than guessing at how Nvidia and Broadcom will perform in the near term, investors should focus on fundamentals like financial results and valuations.\n\nNvidia is the market leader in artificial intelligence chips\n\nNvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry standard in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The company accounted for 98% of data-center GPU sales last year, and it holds at least 80% market share in AI chips, according to analysts.\n\nThe company has reinforced its dominance by expanding into other hardware categories like central processing units (CPUs) and networking equipment, as well as software and services that streamline the development of AI applications. Jim Kelleher at Argus recently wrote, \"In our view, Nvidia stands out because it participates in so many parts of the AI economy.\"\n\nNvidia reported better-than-expected financial results in the first quarter. Revenue surged 262% to $26 billion on strong demand for AI hardware, and non-GAAP net income increased 462% to $15.2 billion. Triple-digit growth will persist forever, but AI spending across hardware, software, and services is forecasted to increase at 37% annually through 2030, and Nvidia should continue to benefit.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Nvidia to grow adjusted earnings per share at 38% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends January 2027). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 65.6 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. Predicting short-term movements following the stock split is impossible, but I believe Nvidia can beat the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\nBroadcom is the market leader in custom silicon and networking chips\n\nBroadcom provides a broad range of semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. But the company is best known for its dominance in data-center networking chips. Harlan Sur at JPMorgan Chase estimates its market share at 80%.\n\nBroadcom also dominates the market for high-end, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), specialized silicon built for complex workloads like AI. Currently, Broadcom co-designs custom machine learning chips with Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, but the company recently landed a third customer that could be Amazon or Apple, according to William Stein at Truist Securities.\n\nBroadcom reported strong financial results in the second quarter. Revenue increased 43% to $12.5 billion on record AI product sales, and non-GAAP net income rose 20% to $5.4 billion. The company is well positioned for future growth given that demand for AI chips should be a tailwind for its networking and custom-silicon businesses.\n\nIndeed, Goldman Sachs analysts recently wrote, \"Alongside Nvidia, we view Broadcom as a critical piece to the ongoing AI infrastructure build-out.\" Bank of America analysts expressed a similar opinion, calling Broadcom a \"top AI pick\" due to strength in ASICs and networking chips.\n\nWall Street expects Broadcom to grow adjusted earnings per share at 21% annually through fiscal 2026 (ends October 2026). That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 35.9 times adjusted earnings look tolerable. Patient investors should consider buying a position in Broadcom today, provided they plan to hold the stock for at least three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Big Short Investor Loves This Tech Stock. Here's How Much You'd Have If You Bought $2,500 Of Nvidia Ten Years Ago\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nSteve Eisman is one of the investors who predicted the financial collapse of 2008 and profited via a strategy known as \"the Big Short,\" where he bet against subprime mortgages. That's why so many follow his market moves, and it just so happens he's a big fan of tech stocks like Nvidia. Why? Calculating what your shares would be worth today if you invested $2,500 in Nvidia 10 years ago would explain everything.\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\n\nToday, Eisman is a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman. In a recent appearance on Bloomberg Television, Eisman expanded on his belief that the tech sector is set for sustained growth due to continued consumer demand for innovations like phone apps and AI enhancements in computing. He told Bloomberg that this demand is spurring \"the biggest refresh cycle in history.\"\n\nHe believes this cycle means \"You have to own the big, large-cap, tech stocks\" such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Nvidia. Eisman also volunteered that he owns \"a lot\" of Nvidia. Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) is one of the world's leading providers of graphics processing units (GPUs), important components in gaming computers that enhance the player experience. GPUs have recently become essential in AI development because they can be used as semiconductors.\n\nIn addition to this crossover usage in semiconductors, Nvidia is expanding the use of their GPUs into data center applications. This is due to Nvidia GPUs' ability to handle heavy workloads and complex tasks. As computer gaming, data centers, cloud storage, and other digital information solutions increase in complexity, their dependence on GPUs will only grow.\n\nAll these potential applications for Nvidia GPUs have created a perfect environment for Nvidia's stock to surge. Since the third quarter of 2023, Nvidia's stock has recently closed at $129.24. Nvidia's current market cap is estimated at a massive $3.2 trillion, and heavy hitters like Eisman think there is still room for more growth.\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.\n\nPerhaps the most amazing aspect of Nvidia's bull run is that it was trading for around $0.47 per share in July 2014. Here is what your shares would be worth if you'd bought $2,500 worth of Nvidia shares in July 2014. A $2,500 investment would have bought you 5,319 shares of Nvidia stock. If you'd held on to your shares, they would be worth $687,446.80 today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's a substantial profit for an initial investment that wasn't much larger than one year's lease payments for a new car. No wonder Steven Eisman is such a big fan of Nvidia. The good news is that opportunities like Nvidia still exist even if you can't get Nvidia for pennies on the dollar anymore. It shows that great things can come from small beginnings, even when it comes to investment portfolios.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Nvidia does not exist alone in the marketplace. The more successful a company like Nvidia is, the more competitors it will draw. Despite Nvidia's recent boom, regulatory changes, market conditions, or other unforeseen challenges could stop its momentum or cause its stock price to fall.\n\nDisclosure: Estimated dividends and share prices fluctuate daily. There may be some variance between the current and estimates when this article was written.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "content": "Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR recently announced that Telxius, a leading global connectivity provider, has opted to leverage Juniper Converged Optical Routing Architecture (CORA) and PTX Series Packet Transport Routers to upgrade its network infrastructure. Telxius is aiming to scale its core and edge network infrastructure to 400G, thereby enhancing network capacity and boosting connectivity to metro networks and data center interconnects.\r\n\r\nWith the growing digital economy, there is an increasing proliferation of high bandwidth intensive applications among customers. Frequent network upgrades to address this surge in demand is a challenging task, as it immensely raises operational costs and also complicates network architecture.\r\n\r\nJuniper\u2019s solution effectively addresses this issue. The company\u2019s offerings include CORA, a flexible, sustainable and automated solution that utilizes IP (Internet Protocol) over DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) technology. By integrating IP routing and optical transport functions into a single network layer, the solution reduces complexity in network architecture, simplifies operations, significantly reduces energy consumption and maximizes routing platform capacity. \r\n\r\nThe solution facilitates seamless upgrades to higher bandwidths, accommodating increasing data traffic without major infrastructure overhauls. By eliminating the need for separate IP routers and optical transport systems, IPoDWDM reduces equipment-related costs and space requirements.\r\n\r\nTelxius boasts an extensive global footprint, delivering connectivity across Spain, the Americas and other parts of Europe. Its network includes more than 100,000 km of fiber optic submarine cables and terrestrial backhauls, offering a wide array of capacity, colocation and security services. Migration of key architecture to Juniper\u2019s CORA and PTX will free up a significant amount of reserved bandwidth for Telxius and ensure a seamless extension to 400G capacity. \r\n\r\nJuniper\u2019s solution will offer enhanced network scalability and bandwidth efficiency while optimizing power and space utilization.

The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compares to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%.\n\nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%.\n\nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\n\nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\n\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. \r\n\r\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. \r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. \r\n\r\nIt is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. \r\n\r\nThreads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nAmgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024. \r\n\r\nThe addition of Horizon\u2019s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide. \r\n\r\nHowever, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position. \r\n\r\nInnovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x. High customer satisfaction and a 91.7% recurring revenue model reduce financial risk. \r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Galaxy Gaming here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), GE Aerospace (GE) and BHP Group Limited (BHP).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "DELL Loses 11% in a Week: Should Investors Buy the Dip?",
        "content": "Dell Technologies DELL shares have dropped 11% in a week. Its prospects have suffered from sluggish PC sales, as well as reports that the U.S. administration will tighten trade restrictions on the chip industry due to China concerns.\r\n\r\nPer IDC\u2019s latest report, DELL is the only vendor that witnessed a shipment decline in the second quarter of 2024. Apple\u2019s AAPL 20.8% estimated year-over-year shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by Acer Group, Lenovo and HP HPQ, whose shipments are expected to have increased 13.7%, 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively. DELL is likely to have declined 2.4%.\r\n\r\nLenovo still leads the market with a 22.7% share trailed by HPQ and DELL at 21.1% and 15.5%, respectively. However, both Dell Technologies and HP lost market share, per IDC data.\r\n\r\nMoreover, President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to impose harsher trade restrictions on China to limit the manufacture of powerful semiconductors has been detrimental to Dell Technologies, as well as other chip stocks like NVIDIA NVDA, AMD, ASML and Micron.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the recent dip in DELL shares presents an entry opportunity for investors. Year-to-date, Dell Technologies shares have returned 63.6%, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 35.7% and the Zacks IT Services industry\u2019s gain of 25.8%.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDell Stock Rides on Strong Portfolio, Partner Base\n\nDELL\u2019s outperformance can be primarily attributed to the strong demand for AI servers driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI (GenAI) applications.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDell AI Factory launch has been a key catalyst. It combines Dell Technologies solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Hugging Face.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies\u2019 robust AI-optimized portfolio has been helping it win enterprise clients rapidly. Its latest PowerEdge XE9680L is an 8-way GPU server with 12 Gen5 PCIe slots and direct-to-chip liquid cooling that improves overall power efficiency by 2.5 times, making it very suitable for enterprises deploying AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies has added the PowerScale F910 to its AI-optimized portfolio, thereby expanding storage capabilities. DELL expanded its networking portfolio with the new PowerSwitch Z9864 with 51 terabits per second of throughput for AI workloads.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Dell Technologies is benefiting from an expanding partner base. NVIDIA has played a pivotal role in developing the Dell AI Factory. The collaboration integrates Dell Technologies\u2019 portfolio with NVIDIA\u2019s AI Enterprise software platform and Tensor Core GPUs, enhancing compute power and simplifying AI application development and deployment for faster time to value.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies is collaborating with NVIDIA to build an AI Factory for Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, which is planning to build a supercomputer by fall next year. It is going to assemble half of the racks for this supercomputer, while the other half will be built by Supermicro.\r\n\r\nDell Technologies and Ericsson are collaborating to develop tailored network cloud infrastructure plans and advise communications service providers on their cloud transformation journeys. The commercial introduction of Ericsson Cloud RAN software on Dell PowerEdge servers with continuous testing and lifecycle management is noteworthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong AI Shipment to Aid Top-line Growth\n\nDell has shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the last three quarters. It expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2025, driven by a strong portfolio of AI-optimized solutions and an expanding partner base.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 2025, Dell expects revenues between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion, indicating growth rate of 8% year over year at the mid-point of $95.5 billion. It expects the Infrastructure Solutions Group to grow by more than 20%, fueled by AI.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dell Technologies Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nDell Technologies Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $96.76 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 9.43%.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStrong top-line growth, along with stringent cost control, is expected to fully offset a 150 basis point decline in gross margin for the fiscal year. Dell expects operating expenses to decline by low single digits for the fiscal year, thereby benefiting the bottom line. Earnings are expected to be $7.65 per share (+/- 25 cents), up 7% at the mid-point for fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for Dell\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.82 per share, up 2% over the past 60 days and indicating 9.68% year-over-year growth.\n\nEstimate Revision Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nDell\u2019s robust portfolio and expanding partner base are key drivers. Its strong liquidity, with a cash balance of $7.3 billion, is noteworthy as it makes dividend payout more sustainable.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Value Style Score of B suggests that DELL is undervalued at this moment.\n\nP/E Ratio (F12M) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is trading at a significant discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 14.43X compared with the Zacks IT Services industry\u2019s 31.52X, making the stock an attractive pick for investors.

        "title": "Here's Why We Think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Might Deserve Your Attention Today",
        "content": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nHow Fast Is NVIDIA Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nIn business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that NVIDIA grew its EPS from US$0.19 to US$1.73, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The good news is that NVIDIA is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 42.5 percentage points to 60%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for NVIDIA's future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre NVIDIA Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince NVIDIA has a market capitalisation of US$2.9t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$114b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes NVIDIA Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nNVIDIA's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching NVIDIA very closely. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAlthough NVIDIA certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with more skin in the game, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have strong insider backing.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Over three decades on Wall Street, Jim Covello has learned how painful it can be to bet against an inflating tech stock bubble. The market has a way of minting riches, month after month, even after it\u2019s clear the latest breakthroughs aren\u2019t playing out quite as expected.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCanada\u2019s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can\u2019t All Stay US Floats Tougher Trade Rules to Rein In China Chip Industry Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO High-Flying Chipmakers See Worst Plunge Since 2020: Markets Wrap Biden Faces Intensified Calls to Step Aside While Ill With Covid\n\nIt happened with dot-com companies in the late 1990s and more recently with cryptocurrencies. And Covello, the head of equity research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., says it\u2019ll likely happen with artificial intelligence, too, making it dangerous, if not outright foolish, to start wagering against the likes of Nvidia Corp.\n\nAnd yet, he has no doubt that the reckoning is coming. It might not be this year or even next year, for that matter, but at some point, he says, it\u2019s happening. As he sees it, the hundreds of billions of dollars companies are plowing into AI won\u2019t set off the next economic revolution \u2014 or even rival the benefits of the smartphone and the Internet. And when that becomes clear, all the stocks that have surged on the back of its promise will come sliding down, too.\n\n\u201cMost technology transitions in history, particularly the ones that have been transformational, have seen us replace very expensive solutions with very cheap solutions,\u201d said Covello, who first made a name for himself at Goldman as a tech stock analyst. \u201cPotentially replacing jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite.\u201d\n\nCovello is emerging as a leader of a small but growing cohort of market watchers who are casting doubt on a crucial tenet of the rally that\u2019s added nearly $16 trillion to the S&P 500 since late 2022: The idea that the dazzling power of large-language models will usher in the next great stage of capitalism, one where corporate profits will boom as more and more work is handed over to intelligent machines, boosting efficiencies and accelerating growth.\n\nThere are plenty of believers. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s chief executive officer, has said he\u2019s convinced that AI will unleash extraordinary changes, potentially as transformative as those brought by the printing press, the steam engine and electricity. State Street Corp.\u2019s chief investment strategist, Michael Arone, said it\u2019s bringing a \u201cprolonged and unprecedented productivity miracle.\u201d Even inside Covello\u2019s own firm, senior global economist Joseph Briggs estimates AI will ultimately automate a quarter of all work tasks and provide a boost to the pace of economic growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch speculation, in turn, has set off a very concrete boom as the world\u2019s biggest tech companies invest heavily in a bid to extend their dominance to the newest sphere. That\u2019s been a bounty for companies like Nvidia, Broadcom Inc. and Super Micro Computer Inc. that provide the hardware needed to power AI models. Even utilities have seen sales jump amid soaring demand from electricity thirsty data centers.\n\nThe problem though, the skeptics say, is that the commercial hopes for the technology may be significantly overblown, creating the risk of a stock-market correction if the tech Goliaths rethink their massive investments.\n\n\u2018The Last Sucker\u2019\n\nDavid Bahnsen, founder and chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, has been preparing for that scenario. He has avoided Nvidia and other large tech stocks, anticipating what he sees as a potential \u201cdisaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way we make money is to not be holding the bag when the last sucker places that trade on Cisco in March of 2000,\u201d he said, referring to the precipitous drop that the hardware company\u2019s shares suffered after the dot-com bubble burst. \u201cA lot of people are going to lose money if they don\u2019t trade out.\u201d\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been few signs of that. While tech stocks tumbled Wednesday on worries chipmakers will be pulled more deeply into a US-China trade war, they are still holding near record highs. Nearly half of the S&P 500\u2019s advance since it bottomed out in October 2022 have been concentrated in just six stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms.\n\nNvidia, which alone has added nearly $2 trillion in market value this year, remains one of the most popular stocks on Wall Street: Sixty four of the analysts who follow the chipmaker are still advising clients to buy it \u2014 even after a nearly 140% jump this year. Only one says to sell.\n\nThe payoff from all that AI investment so far, though, has been relatively modest.\n\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have collectively pumped more than $150 billion into capital expenditures in the last four quarters, with much of that for computing capacity to train their own large-language models and run workloads for customers.\n\nMicrosoft, which has been infusing OpenAI\u2019s technology across its product line, said in April that AI services contributed 7 percentage points to the 31% expansion of sales from Azure and other cloud services in its fiscal third quarter, without giving the dollar amount.\n\nAmazon, with projected sales of more than $600 billion this year, has said only that its AI business has a \u201cmulti-billion dollar revenue run rate.\u201d On Alphabet\u2019s first quarter earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat acknowledged \u201can increasing contribution from AI\u201d to Google Cloud revenue.\n\nTo bulls like Adam Gold, whose largest position is Nvidia shares, the focus on some of those numbers is premature. The Katam Hill chief investment officer notes that companies like Meta \u2014 which doesn\u2019t charge users \u2014 are already seeing sales growth by using AI to improve algorithms for ad placement and engagement.\n\n\u201cThese are the smartest, best capital allocators in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re building these data centers to drive profitability in out years.\u201d\n\nFor some of the customers of the cloud-computing giants, the gains have been less evident. In May, Salesforce Inc. shares tumbled after the software company projected the slowest quarterly sales growth in its history despite long touting the potential for AI to boost sales. According to a survey conducted by San Francisco-based Lucidworks, fewer than half of companies investing in AI have yet to see a significant return.\n\n\u2018Bubbles Take Time\u2019\n\nCovello is doubtful that most ever will. He has followed the tech industry\u2019s ups and downs since joining Goldman in 2000 after stints with SG Cowen and Smith Barney. He specialized in semiconductor-equipment companies, wracking up awards year after year as the sector\u2019s top analyst, before being promoted in 2015 to the firm\u2019s director of Americas equity research.\n\nTo get an adequate return on the approximately $1 trillion of AI infrastructure investment he expects to see over the next several years, companies would need to be able to use it to solve increasingly complex tasks.\n\nAs he sees it, AI has shown the promise of making some jobs like coding more efficient, but not by nearly enough to justify the expense.\n\nIf significant uses don\u2019t start to become apparent in the next year and a half, Covello says, the stock-market tide will turn. Yet he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s nearing that stage yet, with the continued buildout likely to keep driving investors into stocks like Nvidia.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important lessons I\u2019ve learned over the past three decades,\u201d he said, \u201cis that bubbles can take a long time to burst.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit Interviewing Trump on His Plans for the US Economy What Americans Invest In Now\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The S&P 500 has continues to edge higher.\n\nA softer-than-expected inflation report for June fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September. Several major investment advisory firms sifted their forecasts for Fed rate cuts and stock downgrades.\n\nThe CPI report showed only a slight 0.06% increase in core inflation, excluding food and energy prices. The data suggests a deceleration in inflation since the beginning of the year. A notable slowdown in the previously high housing services inflation hints at diminishing inflationary pressures.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe moderation in core CPI elements has led analysts to believe that the inflation trend is on a downward trajectory. Discrepancies exist between the CPI and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. But, the overall pattern indicates a sustained reduction in inflation rates.\n\nEarlier in the week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shared his concerns about achieving a balanced economic \u2018soft landing.\u2019 This involves managing inflation without undermining the employment market.\n\nThe recent cooling of the labor market has lessened the threat of wage-driven inflation. But it also raises concerns about potential increases in unemployment. In the past, the robust labor market granted the Fed the leeway to wait for clear signs of easing inflation before making policy changes. However, current conditions suggest that delaying rate cuts could carry greater risks.\n\nWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) economists project that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September, followed by an additional 25 basis point cut in December. Evercore also expects a rate cut in September.\n\nAs a result of this improving macro backdrop, valuations are becoming stretched. And analysts are forced to cut ratings on the biggest winners, resulting in stock downgrades.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNomura (NYSE:NMR) adjusted its rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), shifting from a buy to a neutral rating. The firm has maintained its price target for the company at $930.00.\n\nThe change in rating comes after Super Micro Computer offered strong guidance for the periods of CY4Q23 to CY1Q24. The analyst notes that the company\u2019s position has evolved from easily surpassing modest market expectations in CY4Q23 to facing a tighter margin for exceeding the already elevated market expectations in CY1Q24.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis shift is attributed to two main uncertainties: the gradual easing of CoWoS-S supply in CY2024F and the potential transition period between Hopper and Blackwell GPUs in the second half of CY2024F.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, the analyst acknowledges SMCI\u2019s competitive edge with its liquid cooling solutions, which are expected to support the company\u2019s gross profit margin (GPM). However, the limited order visibility, due to the aforementioned uncertainties, may challenge Super Micro Computer\u2019s ability to achieve sales that surpass expectations, leading to stock downgrades.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nUBS Group (NYSE:UBS) analysts lowered the rating for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares from neutral to sell, despite increasing the price target from $147 to $197. The analysts pointed out that Tesla is recognized for more than its automotive sector. It has promising developments in Energy and Full Self-Driving (FSD). However, the expectations for its core Auto business are declining.\n\nTSLA is poised to report earnings on July 23rd, following a strong Q2 delivery performance. Analyst consensus estimates the Q2 earnings per share (EPS) at 47 cents. The last time Tesla exceeded EPS expectations was in Q2 of 2023, with a 13% surprise.\n\nAnalysts concluded that the current market valuation leaves a significant portion, over $500 billion, attributed to anticipated future growth. To rationalize the present stock prices, a future value of $1 trillion would need to be realized within five years.\n\nThe report further stated that Tesla\u2019s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) technology is substantial. But the returns may be long-term and the rate of progress could decelerate. The concern is that if market interest in AI wanes, Tesla\u2019s stock multiple might be affected.\n\nGiven these uncertainties and the potential for growth opportunities to emerge later than expected or not at all, coupled with the stock trading at 86 times next twelve months (NTM) price-to-earnings (P/E), the downgrade to sell was justified.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw New Street Research cut its rating on the company\u2019s shares last week. The research firm downgraded NVIDIA from buy to neutral, setting the price target at $135.00. Stock downgrades like this reflect growing concerns in the market.\n\nThe downgrade was prompted by the analyst\u2019s view that NVDA\u2019s upside potential is limited under the current conditions. The consensus among market participants suggests that GPU revenues are expected to rise by 35% by 2025, aligning with previous forecasts.\n\nHowever, the firm sees little room for further growth based on the latest insights from the value chain. According to New Street Research, the likelihood of significant gains for NVIDIA\u2019s stock hinges on a bullish scenario. That would be if the outlook beyond 2025 markedly improves.\n\nCurrently, there is no strong conviction that this scenario will unfold. Market projections indicate a revenue growth deceleration to mid-teens. And this might be threatened by a slowdown in hyperscale capital expenditures and increased competition from ASICs and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThe quality of NVIDIA\u2019s franchise remains solid, and the firm would consider re-entering a buying position should the stock demonstrate prolonged weakness.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market is starting to broaden, with some low-tech value plays helping propel the S&P 500 ahead of the growth- and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 for a change. Undoubtedly, the great rotation from mega-cap tech to other less-heated parts of the market, including the small- and mid-caps, may begin a prolonged breather for the Magnificent Seven and equally hot semiconductor firms.\n\nAs for the cloud computing stocks, I see ample room for a rebound runway, especially regarding the names at or around 52-week lows (or, in some cases, multi-year lows). As the top cloud innovators tap into artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps the less-appreciated cloud laggards benefit from the market\u2019s broadening out in the year\u2019s second half.\n\nHere is a trio of undervalued cloud stocks that look too cheap as we progress through the third quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nData warehousing firm Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) is close to multi-year depths at $136 and change per share. SNOW stock has been under extreme pressure as more details arose from recent data breaches affecting some Snowflake customers.\n\nMost notably, Snowflake client AT&T (NYSE:T) got caught up in the historic data breach. Notably, the breach wasn\u2019t due to an issue with the Snowflake platform but rather an issue with \u201cexposed credentials.\u201d Either way, the situation isn\u2019t good for Snowflake as the firm looks to turn the tide.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the breaches, many investors may be inclined to cut their losses in a name that can\u2019t seem to hang onto any gains.\n\nWhether talking about the big data breach, the CEO change made earlier this year, or the softer, forward-looking guide, you don\u2019t need to look far for reasons to sell the cloud data stock right here while it\u2019s a falling knife.\n\nThe stock is oversold for investors looking to snag a bargain in a name that is still a (small) part of the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) portfolio. Snowflake is a cloud AI play that could surprise investors.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nZscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) is a security firm that has been on the mend for around a year and a half. Despite rolling over this Spring, ZS stock is still up more than 33% over the past year. The dip seems more than buyable for investors comfortable with Beton, a relatively small large-cap with a market cap close to $30 billion.\n\nThough a smaller cybersecurity player, Zscaler has unique growth catalysts that could help it gain power. Apart from rising cybersecurity demand from every publicized breach, Zscaler also stands to gain from smart collaborations with firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and a more focused go-to-market strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if IT cloud budgets stay softer for longer, Zscaler\u2019s security solution stands out as a relatively easy sell in a time when cybersecurity angst is everywhere. At 60.9 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), ZS looks quite lofty. If the company can get AI right, the name may be worth the premium.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese tech giant Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stands out as one of the cheapest cloud and AI stocks in the global market right now. With BABA stock still down around 74% from its 2020 all-time high, the name stands out as a deep-value play, even given the geopolitical risks associated.\n\nAt the time of writing, BABA stock is trading for 18.19 times trailing P/E. Such a depressed multiple seems to discount Alibaba\u2019s potential AI prowess. With new generative AI translation tools recently rolled out to international merchants, it\u2019s about time we view the firm as every bit as AI-savvy as its U.S.-based tech rivals.\n\nWith Alibaba Cloud AI and an unstoppable presence in the Chinese market, perhaps it\u2019s time to bottom-fish for BABA stock, even if it means riding the rough tides out for another year or two.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Berkshire Hathaway (Class B) and Snowflake.

        "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Is Outperforming Nvidia. Can It Keep Doing So?",
        "content": "Share prices of CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) have taken off since the beginning of June, with impressive gains of 22% as of this writing. There are a couple of reasons behind the cybersecurity specialist's robust rally that helped it outpace one of the hottest stocks on the market during this period: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nIt's worth noting that CrowdStrike's gains over the past month are almost double the 11% jump that Nvidia stock has registered. Much of the jump can be attributed to the cybersecurity company delivering impressive fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended April 30) at the start of June. CrowdStrike beat Wall Street's expectations and raised its fiscal 2025 guidance.\n\nThe company's impressive results were followed by news that it would join the S&P 500 index, and that gave the stock another shot in the arm. These positive developments go a long way to explaining why CrowdStrike stock is up nearly 50% in 2024.\n\nShould investors consider buying this cybersecurity stock in anticipation of more upside? Let's find out.\n\nCrowdStrike's AI-powered growth is here to stay\n\nCrowdStrike's revenue in fiscal Q1 increased 33% year over year to $921 million. The revenue jump was driven by customers' increased spending on cybersecurity offerings. CrowdStrike reported that more than 65% of its subscription customers now use five or more of its cybersecurity modules. That was up from 62% a year ago.\n\nEven better, CrowdStrike reported a 95% year-over-year increase in clients using eight or more cybersecurity modules (thanks to the growing demand for its Falcon cybersecurity platform). CrowdStrike has been integrating AI tools and functionalities into the Falcon platform, such as a generative AI-powered security assistant known as Charlotte AI, to help companies shorten response times to cyber threats.\n\nGoing forward, CrowdStrike plans to push the envelope in the AI-enabled cybersecurity market by partnering with companies like Nvidia. The cybersecurity specialist will allow customers to use Nvidia's hardware to train custom cybersecurity large language models so that they can \"improve threat hunting, detect supply chain attacks, identify anomalies in user behavior, and proactively defend against emerging exploits and vulnerabilities.\"\n\nSuch moves could help CrowdStrike capture a bigger share of the AI-enabled cybersecurity market, which is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% through 2031 and generate annual revenue of $114 billion at the end of the forecast period. The growing adoption of the company's AI-enabled cybersecurity platform will allow it to build a solid future revenue pipeline.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's remaining performance obligations (RPO) increased 42% year over year in the previous quarter to $4.7 billion. The metric's growth outpaced the improvement in the company's revenue, which bodes well for the future as the RPO refers to the total value of a company's future contracts that are yet to be fulfilled.\n\nThe improving revenue pipeline also explains why CrowdStrike raised its fiscal 2025 revenue forecast to $3.99 billion at the midpoint from the earlier estimate of $3.95 billion. The updated forecast points toward a potential year-over-year jump of 31% in the company's revenue. But don't be surprised to see CrowdStrike ending the year with stronger growth on the back of its solid RPO.\n\nBut is the stock worth buying right now?\n\nCrowdStrike's better-than-expected results and improved full-year guidance have no doubt stoked investors' enthusiasm, but they have also made the stock quite expensive. CrowdStrike currently trades at 28 times sales, which is significantly higher than the U.S. technology sector's average of 8.3.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens points out that CrowdStrike stock has the highest sales multiple of any public software company with a market cap of more than $75 billion. Chip designer Nvidia, for comparison, has a price-to-sales ratio of 40, but it is growing at a much faster pace than CrowdStrike. Moreover, a closer look at the forward sales multiples indicates that Nvidia is expected to keep growing at a faster pace as its forward reading is much lower than the trailing sales multiple (its P/S is expected to fall from 40 down to 26 while CrowdStrike is expected to go from 28 down to 23). NVDA PS Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nGiven that Nvidia is the dominant player in the AI chip market and has a brighter growth outlook, investors would be tempted to put their money into the semiconductor giant instead of CrowdStrike. After all, CrowdStrike's valuation is the reason Piper Sandler downgraded the stock from overweight to neutral.\n\nAlso, CrowdStrike's 12-month median price target of $400 (as per 48 analysts covering the stock), points toward almost no upside from current levels. That's why investors who have missed this cybersecurity stock's impressive run-up in 2024 would do well to keep it on their watchlists and look for a better entry point before adding CrowdStrike to their portfolios.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "I\u2019ll always advocate for blue-chip stocks as an ideal holding to anchor an investment portfolio. Blue chips provide many benefits that you won\u2019t find elsewhere in the market. But when you\u2019re looking for some names to fit the bill, it\u2019s important to focus on top-rated blue-chip stocks that will give you a better chance for success.\n\nBlue-chip stocks represent companies that are well-established, financially sound, and at the top of their respective industries. When you\u2019re investing in blue-chip stocks, you can usually rely on the companies to provide consistent earnings and a solid financial base. Many blue-chip stocks also pay a reliable dividend as well.\n\nI also like the growth potential offered by top-rated blue-chip stocks. While it\u2019s more difficult to substantially grow a business that\u2019s already sporting a large market cap and is at the top of the field, it\u2019s certainly possible.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop-rated blue-chip stocks can sometimes offer the same dynamic growth that you can find in smaller companies that are favored by investors seeking growth.\n\nWe\u2019re using the Portfolio Grader to screen for and identify the best top-rated blue-chip stocks in the market.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader evaluates stocks based on a variety of factors such as earnings performance, growth, analyst sentiment and momentum to calculate an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d grade. All the names on this list score a coveted \u201cA\u201d rating, meaning that they are the best of the best when it comes to blue-chip names.\n\nAdding one or more of these top-rated blue-chip stocks will give you a solid foundation for your portfolio that balances risk and reward to help you achieve your financial goals.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Exterior view of Nvidia's global headquarters in Santa Clara, California. Since its founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) breaks all the rules \u2013 despite a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Nvidia still shows all the characteristics of a dynamic growth stock, thanks to its industry-leading position with generative artificial intelligence.\n\nEstimates are that Nvidia provides anywhere from 80% to 90% of the high-powered graphics processing units needed to run the most advanced generative AI programs.\n\nAs these GPUs cost tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Nvidia\u2019s profits have been soaring ever since companies realized that AI offerings are a must-have for any tech company.\n\nThat\u2019s how the company was able to show year-over-year revenue growth of 262% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, coming in at $26.04 billion. Operating income was $16.9 billion, up 690% from a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.98 was up 629% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock Investment Institute strategist Wei Li believes that investments in AI data centers to increase 60% to 100% in the coming years, giving Nvidia plenty of room for continued growth. While there may be some short-sellers who believe Nvidia\u2019s runway is short, I\u2019m betting on NVDA to continue to expand.\n\nNVDA stock is up 155% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a dynamic growth story of its own. The company\u2019s Google search engine has a near monopoly on global search traffic with an estimated 91%, giving it unmatched potential to capture the lucrative online advertising market.\n\nGoogle search brought in $46.1 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up from $40.3 billion a year ago. Alphabet also saw strong growth in YouTube advertising ($8.09 billion, up from $6.63 billion a year ago). For the quarter, Google advertising accounted for $61.6 billion of the company\u2019s $80.5 billion in revenue.\n\nTake note, however, that Alphabet has pulled out of its discussed acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) \u2013 a deal that, had it been complete, would have helped Alphabet increase its business software revenue and cloud revenue. But notably investors haven\u2019t punished GOOG stock for the failure of that venture.\n\nConsidering that Alphabet has more than $108 billion in cash on hand, it shouldn\u2019t have any trouble finding another partner should it want to grow the business through an acquisition. It just needs to find the right deal that makes sense for shareholders \u2013 obviously, the HubSpot deal wasn\u2019t it.\n\nGOOG stock is up 31% this year. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another Big Tech company that is using its advertising power to bring in billions in revenue each quarter. While Alphabet has a near-monopoly with internet search, Meta Platforms has a dominant social media presence and reams of information about its users that lets advertisers target messages to specific audiences.\n\nMeta reported that 3.24 billion people on average used its products in the first quarter, up 7% from a year ago. As advertising impressions increased by 20% from a year ago and the average price per ad was up 6%, Meta Platforms saw a huge 27% increase in revenue, bringing in $36.4 billion versus $28.6 billion a year ago.\n\nMeta also offers Meta AI, its generative AI-powered assistant, which can help people create and modify projects and images on the company\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger platforms.\n\nMETA stock is up 39% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been called Big Blue since the 1980s, a tribute to its blue color scheme on signs and on the company\u2019s displays and cases in the 20th century. But I think it could better be called \u201cBig Blue Chip\u201d based on its track record of being one of the best blue-chip stocks you can buy for generations.\n\nIBM traces its history back for generations, all the way to punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s. It was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nToday, Big Blue offers the Watson AI engine and the Watsonx generative AI platform to its enterprise customers. It\u2019s one of the top cloud infrastructure providers in the world.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter earnings included revenue of $14.5 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 69%. And earnings per share of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM stock is up 13% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is another legacy tech company that is finding new ways to compete in the 21st century. Dell is best known as a manufacturer of computers, laptops and mobile devices, but the company is also working in AI by operating a large server business that allows companies to upgrade their hardware to run AI applications.\n\nDell is expected to be a major player in the AI space for years to come. It\u2019s building and selling servers that include Nvidia\u2019s highly prized H100 GPU and Blackwell-generation chips. Dell\u2019s backlog of orders for its AI servers increased 30% during the first quarter to $3.8 billion. AI server sales rose 42% to $5.5 billion.\n\nDell is also working with Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI artificial intelligence company to build xAI\u2019s supercomputer and power the Grok chatbot.\n\nDell\u2019s AI offerings will be a catalyst for many quarters to come. The stock is up 75% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is perhaps the best streaming service on the planet. Only Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, which offers free streaming, has a greater reach than Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe have built a hard to replicate combination of a strong slate, superior recommendations, broad reach and intense fandom, which drives healthy engagement on Netflix,\u201d the company said in its first-quarter earnings report. \u201cImprovement in these key areas is the best way to delight our members and continue to grow our business.\u201d\n\nNetflix is reporting Q2 earnings after the closing bell on July 18. Investors should be looking for revenue growth (up 15.9% in the first quarter from a year ago), global streaming paid memberships (up 16% in Q1) and global streaming paid net additions (up 9.3%).\n\nIf Netflix can continue to show improvement on those numbers, thanks to its relatively new strategy to end password sharing, then Netflix stock will continue its ascent.\n\nNFLX stock is up 34% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Harun Ozmen / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer on the planet, boasting more than 10,800 locations that includes every U.S. state and two dozen countries.\n\nI also appreciate that Walmart is aggressively growing its e-commerce business. Considering its footprint, why pay another company to ship and deliver its goods to customers who want to order online when there\u2019s business there ripe for the taking? It\u2019s better for Walmart to do it itself.\n\nWalmart also is investing heavily in drone delivery. Since launching drone delivery in 2021, the company has completed more than 30,000 unmanned deliveries.\n\nWalmart is also working on bridging the drone service, where available, with the Walmart app \u2013 customers who order online will be notified if they are eligible for drone delivery. While there are still regulatory hurdles to clear, I appreciate that Walmart is looking for avenues forward to make the company more profitable.\n\nWMT stock is up 33% this year and gets an \u201cA\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a LONG position in NVDA.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "content": "If you missed out on major AI stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) this year, don\u2019t worry. There are still plenty of opportunities in the AI sector, particularly among smaller companies that have yet to catch the market\u2019s attention. Many of these firms have been quietly leading AI development for years or innovating in unaddressed ways, but their potential remains largely unrecognized. Even as some see the wider AI sector as entering, or firmly in, bubble territory, these AI stocks\u2019 smaller size and unique offerings help shield against wider segment risks.\n\nSome of the best AI stocks to consider are those applying artificial intelligence to more traditional industries. While generative AI grabs headlines with its ability to create art or suggest recipes, the real long-term winners will likely be AI companies enhancing core business operations or offering customers and clients unique solutions to common problems. These less glamorous but highly practical applications of AI promise substantial returns as they drive efficiency and innovation across various sectors.\n\nStem (STEM) Automated stock trading concept.

AI Stocks with Potential. stocks to buy. Strong Buy AI Stocks\n\nSource: Owlie Productions / Shutterstock.com\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) shares popped this week on seemingly no news, but that\u2019s a boon to this undervalued AI stock operating in a unique position at the intersection of sustainable energy infrastructure and artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStem\u2019s Athena platform acts as an AI-enabled control system for physical clean energy assets across a spectrum of services, including energy-generating assets as well as utility and overall grid management systems. Athena aggregates data across these systems alongside peripheral information like weather reporting to optimize clean energy generation, storage and optimal resource flow. In effect, Stem helps clean energy asset owners improve their systems\u2019 financial output as well as its power, and those owners enjoy a 10-30% internal rate of return improvement by leveraging the systems.\n\nA newer company rapidly expanding, Stem\u2019s year-over-year revenue climbed 62% to $25 million and bookings nearly doubled over the same period. Stem is rapidly approaching break-even operating cash flow territory, too, making the affordable AI stock one to snag before it starts surging.\n\nMitek Systems (MITK) 3D rendering of a female robot looking very sad. Dark background. AI stocks are down. AI Stocks. doomed AI Stocks\n\nSource: Sarah Holmlund / Shutterstock.com\n\nMitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) helps businesses manage identity verification processes which is all the more important today as deepfakes, fraudsters and all-around bad actors try to subvert systems for pleasure and profit. The company leverages AI to do so by applying computer vision and machine learning to validate real-time visualizations from users and customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustry experts recognize Mitek\u2019s strength among AI stocks and awarded the firm the \u201cAuthentication Innovation Award\u201d at a recent AI Breakthrough Awards program. Judges based Mitek\u2019s strength on its four-fold, AI-enabled verification system that combines selfies, liveness validation to mitigate bot and deepfake photos, voice biometrics and voice liveness.\n\nThough not yet wildly profitable, Mitek is nevertheless a solid performer, hitting a 1 cent EPS in its most recent quarterly report, and expects the fiscal year\u2019s remainder to offer a 6% sales growth rate and land between $180 and $185 million. Moreover, Mitek is able to accomplish something that many small-cap AI stocks can\u2019t: repurchase shares to improve shareholder value. The company just announced a $50 million buyback program over the next two years.\n\nEvolv Technologies (EVLV) AI text on smartphone against background of green stock chart.

AI stocks to buy\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of Former President Trump, expect site and event security to compound considerably nationally. And Evolv Technologies (NASDAQ:EVLV) stands out among AI stocks as one of the few, if not only, companies leveraging next-gen AI tech to help secure infrastructure and people. Evolv leverages artificial intelligence to expand screening capabilities beyond human potential to improve screening speed and accuracy.\n\nThough Evolv is a relative newcomer among AI stocks, the company hit markets with a bang. Its recurring revenue more than doubled YOY, hitting a 120% growth rate after adding 300 companies to its client list. Moreover, Evolv is making rapid inroads into healthcare markets, which surprisingly host a massive workplace violence rate. Evolv currently screens 500,000 daily healthcare visitors across 300 hospital buildings daily, but with a total addressable market of 6,000 hospitals, the AI stock has plenty of room to expand moving forward.\n\nVertiv Holdings (VRT) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, all AI stocks need essential infrastructure to keep the lights on and GPUs running, and Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) is a standout in this segment. Vertiv owns and operates a range of key AI infrastructure, including power continuity, heat management and monitoring software services.\n\nAs with many AI stocks, Vertiv\u2019s strength continues unabated. In the most recent report, order rates climbed 60% year over year, and net sales jumped 8%. Unlike many AI stocks, though, Vertiv is effectively agnostic to which hardware or software AI stocks come out on top. They\u2019re selling picks and shovels to artificial intelligence gold miners and win no matter which companies ultimately dominate the industry.\n\nAnalysts widely seen Vertiv as a top AI stock, with Oppenheimer saying shares are worth $100, more than 10% upside, and nearly every research firm or analyst covering the company affirming a buy rating. Shares may seem overvalued if you look at price-to-earnings ratio alone, it current sits at 44x. But, considering its growth trajectory and tailwinds, buying sooner rather than later may be the best move.\n\nParsons (PSN) Hand with pen marking holographic chart with the word \"AI\". Artificial Intelligence\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/everything possible\n\nParsons (NYSE:PSN) might not have the name recognition of sister companies like Palantir. Still, it\u2019s a powerhouse in the defense tech sector with a unique focus on AI-driven hardware solutions. Unlike firms concentrating on software, Parsons excels in applying AI to physical systems, making significant strides in several critical areas.\n\nParsons\u2019 portfolio includes developing ballistic missile sites, advanced rocketry, nuclear facility management and vital infrastructure projects. These activities require sophisticated data management and AI oversight, positioning Parsons as a leader in hardware-centric AI applications.\n\nBeyond defense, Parsons is innovating with AI-driven drone technology for infrastructure inspection. These tools revolutionize evaluating and maintaining critical infrastructure such as bridges, roadways and water treatment plants. This strategic expansion positions Parsons as a vital player in applying AI to complex and hazardous environments, ensuring comprehensive safety assessments and ongoing infrastructure integrity. Better yet, expect infrastructure to be a major political talking point as we near the elections, creating unique tailwinds for Parsons that few other AI stocks can adequately capture.\n\nGetty Images\u00a0(GETY) GettyImages (GETY Stock) logo on a smartphone in front of a computer.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an underrated stock with significant growth potential, especially considering its newfound AI stock status due to its strategic partnership with Nvidia. While the company is well-known for its extensive library of stock photos and journalism photography, its foray into AI technology could be a game-changer, positioning it among today\u2019s top overlooked AI stocks.\n\nIn January, Getty launched a generative AI image creator powered by Nvidia, which simplifies creating customized images for professionals and amateurs. Unlike other platforms like Midjourney, Getty\u2019s tool is user-friendly and integrates significant legal protections for its users. This legal coverage is increasingly in demand as it shields users from potential copyright or data harvesting lawsuits, an increasingly important feature for large-scale and corporate clients.\n\nDespite a recent dip in sales and income, Getty\u2019s latest earnings report highlighted a 5% increase in subscription rates, now accounting for 55.4% of the company\u2019s net revenue. This growth is expected to continue, driven by wider adoption of its AI-powered offerings. As Getty Images expands its AI capabilities, the company is poised for further revenue growth, making it a unique play among AI stocks.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is transforming the seemingly mundane sector of warehouse management with its AI-driven solutions. While it might not spark the same excitement as AI-generated content, major corporations like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) recognize its offerings\u2019 benefit to their bottom line. This level of corporate endorsement is a strong indicator of the company\u2019s value, but Symbotic isn\u2019t stopping there.\n\nRecently, the company announced the development of a new AI-managed warehouse system designed for smaller companies. This system is intended for shared-use facilities where multiple small businesses operate. This strategic move significantly broadens Symbotic\u2019s total addressable market, positioning it to capitalize on the rapidly growing warehouse and storage sector. By targeting smaller-scale operations, Symbotic is poised to tap into a previously underserved segment, offering substantial growth potential for investors.\n\nSymbotic is also unique among AI stocks on this list in that it\u2019s suffering from high short interest, which currently sits at nearly 28%. This scenario makes Symbotic primed for a short squeeze considering its strengths, prospects and current per-share pricing drop since January.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The CEO of Nvidia Just Sold 700,000 Shares of His Company's Stock. Here's What Investors Need to Know.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI), which some are hailing as the next technological revolution on par with the internet, is the investing theme of the moment.\n\nThe incredible promise of the technology led investors to lift Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock to dizzying heights. The semiconductor powerhouse designs and sells the chips that make AI possible, putting it in a unique position in the emerging industry that led to quarter after quarter of incredible revenue growth.\n\nSo why did its CEO, Jensen Huang, sell 700,000 shares of its stock last week? Well, in short, I don't know. No one but Huang and his accountant do. What I do know is that there are plenty of reasons that don't involve him losing faith in his company. Although it's tempting to see it as a reason to run for the hills, it's really not.\n\nInvestors have to keep things in perspective. Jensen Huang owns more than 800 million shares, worth north of $100 billion, for those counting. The shares he sold last week amount to less than 0.1% of his net worth. Do you think that shows a lack of faith? Huang likely sold these shares for something as boring as paying taxes.\n\nWhile it's interesting to see what a C-suite is doing with its company's stock, you can't rely on it to make decisions. Instead, always return to evaluating the business as a whole. So, is Nvidia still a good pick?\n\nNvidia is a cash machine. The question is, can it continue?\n\nControlling the lion's share of the AI chip market means Nvidia is printing money, growing at an incredible rate. Take a look at this chart showing the amazing growth over the last three years. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt looks to be continuing as well -- at least in the short term. Consensus estimates put the company's revenue at $120.6 billion this year, a nearly 98% jump from last year. That is serious growth for any company, let alone one vying for the title of the biggest company in the world by market cap.\n\nNow, observers have to expect this to cool somewhat, but can the chipmaker still sustain strong growth moving forward? Well, there are some pretty tall hurdles to clear. The most pressing threat comes from ramped-up competition from its old rival, AMD.\n\nThis company has set its sights on grabbing some of Nvidia's pie, and although it likely will, it's a matter of how much. Thankfully for Nvidia investors, AMD is currently being outspent almost two to one by Nvidia in research and development (R&D), and it has the resources to keep it this way. I think this will allow Nvidia to stay one or two steps ahead for some time.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's future depends on the future of AI as a whole\n\nWhile plenty of challenges lie ahead for Nvidia, perhaps the biggest is whether AI itself actually delivers on its promise. Despite all the hype, there's still a lot to prove. It wouldn't be the first time a technology failed to deliver to the degree investors hoped.\n\nThink of AI and all the businesses that enable it and benefit from it as a river. Nvidia is somewhere in the middle, upstream from the companies that deliver AI products to the end market. If those companies can't deliver AI products to the market that create immense economic benefit, they can't justify buying the hardware Nvidia produces, at least not at the same rate. In other words, the river dries up. AI has to actually deliver real value to real people -- otherwise, Nvidia may have some issues.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks With Scorching-Hot Upside of Up to 100%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Roughly 30 years ago, the advent and subsequent proliferation of the internet changed the growth trajectory for businesses worldwide. Since then, investors have been patiently waiting for the next game-changing technology to come along and rival what the internet did for corporate America. After an extended wait, artificial intelligence (AI) looks to have answered the call.\n\nThe \"rise of AI\" involves the use of software and systems for tasks that humans would normally handle. Moreover, these AI-driven systems have the capacity to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. This ability to grow more proficient at assigned tasks, as well as potentially learn new skills, gives AI utility across the board. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nLast year, the analysts at PwC released a report (Sizing the Prize, PwC's Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution) that estimated AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy via consumption-side benefits and productivity gains come 2030.\n\nWith this seemingly limitless addressable market, Wall Street's financial institutions and analysts have paid close attention to the AI revolution. While most analysts expect meaningful upside to come from cutting-edge AI stocks, certain companies might have an inside track to outsize gains.\n\nAccording to select Wall Street analysts, three AI stocks offer scorching-hot upside of up to 100% over the next 12 months.\n\nNvidia: Implied upside of 55%\n\nTo no one's surprise, the first artificial intelligence stock pegged by at least one Wall Street analyst to deliver outsize gains over the next year is leading hardware provider and innovator Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nRosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann increased his and his firm's price target on Nvidia to $200 from $140 following the company's recent 10-for-1 stock split. If Mosesmann's forecast were to prove accurate, the company would have a roughly $5 trillion market cap, and existing shareholders would enjoy an additional 55% upside from where shares closed on July 12.\n\nOne aspect of Mosesmann's optimism has to do with the company being on the pole position when it comes to AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs). On top of its H100 GPUs currently dominating in AI-accelerated data centers, it plans to introduce its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture later this year, and its Rubin platform in 2026. There's a realistic chance that Nvidia's chips will retain a clear advantage over the competition.\n\nMosesmann is equally excited about Nvidia's software. For instance, he believes the company's CUDA platform -- a tool kit used by developers to build large language models -- will go hand-in-hand with its hardware to keep businesses under its umbrella of products.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut even though Nvidia's operating ramp-up has been virtually flawless, expecting close to $1.8 trillion in added upside to the company's already lofty valuation seems unlikely. History has a knack for spoiling the euphoria that fuels next-big-thing innovations. Over the last 30 years, no new innovation or trend has avoided an early-stage bubble, and artificial intelligence probably isn't the exception.\n\nFurthermore, there's a very real scenario in which Nvidia retains its GPU advantages and still loses. In addition to increasing external competition, Nvidia's top customers by net sales are all developing AI-GPUs for their data centers. Both the scarcity that's driven the prices of these GPUs into the stratosphere, and the data center space needed to fuel demand for Nvidia's hardware, are going to diminish. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMobileye Global: Implied upside of 100%\n\nA second AI stock with mouthwatering upside, at least according to one Wall Street pundit, is Mobileye Global(NASDAQ: MBLY), a developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies.\n\nAlthough analyst Itay Michaeli at Citigroup has reduced his and his company's price target for Mobileye on a handful of occasions, the current target of $53 represents a cool 100% upside from where shares parked at the end of last week (July 12).\n\nMichaeli's bullishness primarily has to do with the expectation that advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) will -- pardon the necessary pun -- drive the use of Mobileye's solutions. This includes its next-generation EyeQ6H platform, which is a centralized chip with three times the power of its predecessor chip and will be tasked with improving ADAS capabilities in AVs.\n\nMichaeli's research note also points to advancements in Mobileye's SuperVision, the company's end-to-end ADAS technology that is enabled by 11 cameras, Road Experience Management-based AV maps, and the company's next-gen centralized EyeQ chips. SuperVision claims to support Level 2, 3, and 4 autonomous capabilities.\n\nAnother factor working in Mobileye's favor is its pristine balance sheet. This is a company generating positive operating cash flow that, as of March 30, had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt.\n\nHowever, reaching $53 per share could prove challenging. Even with next-gen vehicles becoming increasingly reliant on technology, we've witnessed tepid demand for electric vehicles (EVs) in recent quarters. With industry stalwarts like General Motors and Ford Motor Company scaling back their investments in EVs, it's become evident that Mobileye's growth prospects could ebb and flow as the EV industry and technology matures.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied upside of 65%\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that can offer scorching-hot upside over the next 12 months, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is customizable rack server and storage solutions specialist Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI).\n\nDespite Supermicro's stock rallying 220% year to date, and more than 1,000% since the curtain opened on 2023, analyst Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital foresees shares climbing by another 65% over the coming year. Baruah's price target of $1,500 for Supermicro was released in mid-April.\n\nBaruah's research report focuses on Super Micro Computer's positioning within the rapidly growing AI server market, and he expects the company's customizable solutions to be popular as more and more businesses aim to hop aboard the AI revolution. Based on Wall Street's consensus revenue estimates of $14.9 billion in 2024 and $24 billion in 2025, Supermicro's sales are expected to grow by 237% in just a two-year stretch.\n\nBut keep in mind that Super Micro Computer's growth trajectory is heavily reliant on Nvidia. The company's high-end rack servers incorporate Nvidia's H100 GPUs -- and Nvidia is already working with a sizable backlog for its H100. Supermicro's growth prospects could dwindle if AI-GPU scarcity persists longer than expected.\n\nHistory is also doubly concerning when it comes to Super Micro Computer. For one, expectations were high during the early stages of the cloud-computing boom in the mid-2010s. Unfortunately, the company's growth rate failed to live up to lofty expectations. In other words, we've seen Supermicro fail to live up to the hype before.\n\nThe other concern echoes what I noted earlier about Nvidia. Every game-changing innovation, technology, and trend since the mid-1990s has needed time to mature, and we're not there yet with AI. With most businesses lacking a well-defined plan to benefit from artificial intelligence, Supermicro, like Nvidia, would be exposed to significant downside if and when the AI bubble bursts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Tech stocks led the market in the first half of 2024, and there is no reason they can't continue leading the market into the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be a game changer that should help power the sector higher in the years to come.\n\nLet's look at three tech stocks to buy this year and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo company has benefited more from the increased interest in AI than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are being used to harness the power of AI in the data center. The company has created a stranglehold on the GPU market through its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform that long ago became the industry standard for programming GPUs before AI became the next big thing.\n\nWith developers trained on its software platform, it has become difficult for other chipmakers to make a dent in Nvidia's dominance, and there does not appear to be anything on the horizon to challenge its market-leading position. At the same time, the company sped up its innovation cycle to further widen its lead, looking to push out new GPU architecture platforms almost every year.\n\nThe company's growth has been nothing short of spectacular, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% year over year to $26 billion. While that level of growth is unsustainable, demand for many of its chips outstrips supply, and customers are still in the early days of building out their AI infrastructures. This should continue to lead to strong growth in the years to come.\n\nAt the same time, given its growth, the stock is reasonably priced at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 47 times. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhile Nvidia has been at the forefront of AI on the chip side, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been the AI leader on the cloud computing and software side. Through its partnership with and investment in OpenAI, Microsoft has incorporated AI throughout its various offerings.\n\nIts Azure cloud-computing business has been the biggest beneficiary of AI thus far, as shown by the segment's revenue jumping 31% year over year last quarter. This is a pay-as-you-go business where customers pay only for the resources they use, and that usage has been soaring as clients use the Azure platform to build their own AI solutions. The company has seen deals getting bigger, with Azure deals worth more than $10 million last quarter doubling and $100 million-plus deals up 80%.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's introduction of AI assistant Copilots is helping power other parts of its business as well. Its GitHub Copilot, which can make suggestions to help complete coding, helped power a 45% increase in revenue for its developer platform GitHub segment. The company is also using AI in its Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn offerings, which helped drive 14% and 29% year-over-year revenue growth, respectively, in each segment last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of under 34 times, the stock's valuation is consistent with where it has traded over the past five years. Given the growth potential from AI in front of it, this is a solid stock to buy at current levels. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n3. DocuSign\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft have been early AI leaders, DocuSign(NASDAQ: DOCU) has the potential to be a later AI beneficiary. The company known for its e-signature solution has witnessed its growth slow as it saw a lot of pull forward in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then saw one of its biggest end markets, residential real estate, come under pressure.\n\nHowever, this company has a cash-rich balance sheet and generates a lot of free cash flow. At the same time, with its new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) solution, it is looking to combine its e-signature and contract lifecycle management (CLM) products to become a platform company.\n\nIt will also begin incorporating AI technology into its new IAM platform, which it obtained from its recent acquisition of AI-powered agreement-management software company Lexion. The company has already introduced a number of new features to be included in IAM, such as Maestro, which can create agreements without coding, and Navigator, which can store and analyze a customer's agreement databases. DOCU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio under 18 and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple of under 12, the stock is attractively valued, given its leading position in the e-signature market and potential growth drivers with its new IAM solution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Tech rebound, Netflix, TSMC, ECB decision - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to rebound Thursday after the tech sector's battering during the previous session. TSMC has reported strong results, while Netflix is due to release its latest numbers after the close. The European Central Bank is expected to stand pat at its latest policy-setting meeting.\n\n1. Futures rebound after tech battering\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely higher Thursday, rebounding after the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\u2019s worst session since 2022 as investors grow wary of the elevated valuations of the big tech stocks.\n\nBy 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 90 points, or 0.5%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.8% on Wednesday, its worst day since December 2022, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, gained 0.6%, closing above 41,000 for the first time ever.\n\nAll eyes will remain on the tech sector, although the strong results from TSMC [see below] could generate some confidence.\n\nThere are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) before the open, while streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is expected to post results after the close (see below).\n\nOn the economic front, jobless claims for the week ending July 13 are due later in the session, as investors look for clues about the health of the country\u2019s labor market with the Federal Reserve seeking more guidance before cutting interest rates.\n\n2. TSMC posts strong rise in Q2 net profit\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) may face choppy waters ahead, but there\u2019s no doubt the Taiwanese chipmaker is thriving at the moment.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker posted a hefty 36% rise in second-quarter net profit earlier Thursday, riding the surge in demand for semiconductors used in artificial intelligence applications.\n\nTSMC posted a net profit of T$247.85 billion ($7.6 billion), compared with Reuters expectations for a profit of T$236.1 billion.\n\nIt is the world\u2019s main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, counting companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) among its clientele.\n\nThe surge in AI demand over the past year, as a slew of tech giants raced to roll out their own offerings after the success of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, has resulted in the firm\u2019s American Depository Receipts reaching a total market capitalization of over $1 trillion.\n\nThe firm is considered as a bellwether for the global chipmaking industry, given that it has the highest capacity for producing advanced chips in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, TSMC stock slumped on Wednesday on heightened geopolitical tensions, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies, putting the spotlight on the island\u2019s most important company.\n\nOn top of this, reports emerged that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, which could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\n3. Netflix net adds set to contract\n\nNetflix releases its latest results after the close Thursday, with the streaming giant having already guided for lower net subscriber additions in the second quarter than in the first three months of the year.\n\nLSEG forecasts that the company will have added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, which would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nThis dropoff follows sharp gains in the wake of a crackdown on password sharing and as viewer attention moved to summer sporting events including the European Championships soccer tournament.\n\nThe company added an estimated 4.82 million subscribers in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. That would be the lowest additions since the first quarter of 2023 and about half the 9.3 million it added in the previous three months.\n\nThat said, JPMorgan believes Netflix may spring a few upside surprises, supported by an impressive content slate, price hikes and ongoing benefits from efforts to crackdown on password sharing.\n\n\"We remain positive on Netflix shares heading into 2Q earnings, analysts at JPMorgan said, in a note published last week, \u201cwhile also recognizing high expectations.\"\n\nIndustry data suggests rising demand, JPMorgan said, citing Sensor Tower\u2019s data showing global download and daily active user trends improved in 2Q.\n\n4. ECB set to hold rates steady\n\nThe European Central Bank holds its latest policy-setting meeting later in the session, and is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged having lowered rates from record highs last month.\n\nThe focus, thus, is likely to be on ECB President Christine Lagarde\u2019s accompanying press conference, with investors looking for clues over the future path of interest rates.\n\nLagarde will likely attempt to strike a balance, acknowledging that regional growth is weak, but domestic inflation and wage growth remains stubbornly high.\n\nMarkets are pricing in almost two rate cuts over the rest of the year, with the next move lower widely expected to be in September.\n\n\u201cThe ECB will keep rates on hold in July,\u201d said analysts at Morgan Stanley, in a note. \u201cFrom its perspective, more data is needed to confirm the assumed (and projected) timely return of inflation to target.\u201d\n\n5. Warner Bros Discovery to split up?\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) has discussed a plan to split its digital streaming and studio businesses from its legacy TV networks, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, as it looks to generate greater value for its shareholders.\n\nThe report said that CEO David Zaslav is examining several strategic options for the media and entertainment conglomerate, ranging from selling assets to separating its Warner Bros movie studio and Max streaming service into a new company.\n\nWarner Bros' stock has fallen nearly 27% so far this year, and nearly 70% since the merger between Discovery and AT&T (NYSE:T) spin-off Warner Media in 2022.\n\nIn May, the company reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss due to slumping advertising sales at its cable TV unit and as the studio segment contended with the fallout of last year's Hollywood strikes.\n\n\"While several financial assumptions behind the combination of Warner Media and Discovery have not materialized, we still believe several of WBD's assets are best in class with tremendous unrecognized value,\" analysts at Bank of America said, in a note earlier this week.\n\nThe company could create more value for its shareholders if it explored strategic options, including a potential sale, the bank added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech rebound, Netflix, TSMC, ECB decision - what's moving markets\n\nBOJ wants to maintain accommodative monetary environment, Jiji reports\n\nIndia's Modi to focus on jobs, incomes in first budget after election setback\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after a rout in chipmaking stocks, on concerns over more trade disruptions, sparked steep losses on Wall Street.\n\nGrowing bets on early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also spurred a broader pivot away from technology stocks and into more growth-sensitive sectors. This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge to record highs even as its Wall Street peers lagged.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,652.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,067.0 points by 20:43 ET (00:43 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,589.0 points.\n\nChip stocks rise after China fears, Trump comments spur steep losses\n\nHeavyweight technology and chipmaking stocks rose in aftermarket trade after clocking outsized losses during the session.\n\nHeavyweights such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 1% after a 6.6% slide, while TSMC (NYSE:TSM) rose 2.4% after a nearly 8% tumble. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also steadied after falling during the session.\n\nReports that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, battered the sector, given that it could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\nConcerns over heightened geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan dented chip stocks, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by a broader shift into more economically sensitive sectors, amid growing bets that the Fed will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nThis saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.6% to a record high of 41,198.08 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,588.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite finished down 2.8% at 17,997.81 points.\n\nNetflix, TSMC earnings awaited\n\nFocus remained on the second quarter earnings season, with technology majors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and TSMC set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nTSMC is considered a bellwether for the chipmaking industry, and is expected to log a bumper second quarter profit on increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nLithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), which is also considered a bellwether for the chip industry, clocked stronger than expected second quarter earnings, as it flagged increased demand from the AI industry.\n\nEarnings from Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX), Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) are also due on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as chip rout eases; more earnings awaited\n\nAustralia's Domino's Pizza slumps to over 9-year low on bleak store growth view\n\nInsurance broker TWFG prices US IPO above range to raise about $187 million\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Robotics Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Humans have enjoyed the fruits of automation for a long time, at least since the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. We are now entering a more complex age that relies on both smarter machines and the management of data, making it an opportune time to consider robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nOn one hand, a machine is nothing without sense data, just as humans are crippled in their actions without eyesight. On the other hand, even if that sense data is there, it has to be effectively coordinated into a holistic system.\n\nUnderlying such a system is the Internet of Things (IoT). Its industrial component alone is poised for a 17.2% CAGR by 2032, while consumer IoT is set for a 12.7% CAGR by 2030. These companies are tightening the intersection between enhanced connectivity and robotics platforms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArbe Robotics (ARBE) Photo of a man sitting in a self-driving vehicle on a city street.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov/ShutterStock.com\n\nFor investors betting on the autonomous driving future, Arbe Robotics (NASDAQ:ARBE) should be considered as one of the key robotics stocks to buy now. Based in Israel, the company provides the necessary sense hardware for full self-driving (FSD) to be feasible.\n\nThis includes 4D imaging radar solutions with ultra-high resolution and 360-degree coverage as well as Phoenix imaging radar to rapidly detect hundreds of objects up to 300 meters away. These solutions are steadily being adopted in the trucking industry to pave the road for level 4 autonomous driving.\n\nMost recently on July 1st, the company announced that one of the top 10 OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) selected Arbe\u2019s chipset for 4D radar imaging. So far, the company expanded its reach to China, Germany and the United States.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights as of the June report, the radar sensor market size is heading for a CAGR of 17.8% by 2032. At the moment, ARBE trades for $2.34 per share. That is above the 52-week average of $2.09 but ARBE shares are still far below its all-time high of $14.79 in November 2021. In the last three months, ARBE stock is up 25%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough there are nearly a dozen robotics surgery companies, such as Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Stryker (NYSE:SYK) and Asensus (NYSEMKT:ASXC), it appears that Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) offers the most widely adopted platform with its da Vinci system. With a long track record of successful surgeries since 2000, the company is simply ahead of the game.\n\nConsidering all the factors that could go wrong in such delicate matters, ISRG stock has received the most traction. Intuitive\u2019s latest da Vinci 5 iteration makes for a fully integrated robotics surgery platform ready for mass deployment. The company improved the Force Feedback feature for a better sense of pull and push forces by the operator.\n\nStory continues\n\nCombined with improved ergonomics and high-resolution 3D imaging, da Vinci 5 boasts over 150 design innovations. Of course, this also includes future-proofing by giving it enough computing power to harness AI advances.\n\nIn the Q1 earnings call, the Californian company delivered $545 million net income compared to $355 million in the year-ago quarter. With an operating margin of 33.3%, this makes Intuitive Surgical a high-margin business.\n\nPresently priced at $438.01, ISRG stock is near its 52-week high of $449. Yet, just as is the case with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), this may just be the beginning of Intuitive Surgical\u2019s continued rise and dominance, making it one of the top robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nSamsara (IOT) 3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Should Consider\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile flashy humanoid robots catch the public\u2019s attention, automation at scale relies on data coordination between various sectors. This is the mission of Samsara (NYSE:IOT). The stock\u2019s ticker symbol is also the acronym for the Internet of Things (IoT), hinting at the company\u2019s goal to integrate data from multiple platforms into a unified platform experience.\n\nThe California firm supplies many industries with solutions for AI cameras, real-time GPS, continuous diagnostics, electrification, real-time tracking of trailers, remote visibility and training for its host of devices.\n\nIn other words, the rollout of physical robots will likely involve Samsara\u2019s coordination services in logistics and transportation. For fiscal Q1 2025, the company generated $280.7 million in revenue, 37% more than the year-ago quarter, while netting $23.7 million cash from operations. The company holds an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion and total liabilities of $825.5 million.\n\nNonetheless, Samsara\u2019s price-to-book (PB) ratio of 22.81 suggests that investors are highly optimistic about IoT growth. After all, it has been a constant theme at the World Economic Forum.\n\nCurrently priced at $38.26, IOT stock is nearly double the 52-week low of $21.48 per share. The stock has gained 17% in value year-to-date. Nasdaq forecasts an average price target of $41.1 for IOT shares. A less optimistic target estimates the value at $36, aligning with the current price. Samsara\u2019s robust growth and strategic position in IoT and automation make it a compelling buy. It stands out as a top choice among robotics stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Argo Infrastructure Partners on Powering the AI Gold Rush Through Data Centers",
        "content": "By CorpGov Editorial Staff\n\nThe data center industry continues to experience phenomenal growth as the digitalization of the economy accelerates exponentially across sectors. Against this backdrop, infrastructure investment firm Argo Infrastructure Partners LP (\u201cArgo\u201d) has made a series of notable investments to become the majority owner of TierPoint, a leading U.S. data center operator and provider of enterprise-class data center solutions.\n\nWe sat down with Jason Zibarras, founder of Argo Infrastructure Partners and Brice Soucy, Argo Senior Director and TierPoint Board Member, to explore why TierPoint stands out as an attractive target in this dynamic market and as a platform for future investment growth. We\u2019ll examine Argo\u2019s investment thesis and capabilities, assess TierPoint\u2019s competitive positioning and potential for durable long-term growth, discuss additional investment to capitalize on the macro trends propelling demand for data center services and evaluate why TierPoint is a match for Argo\u2019s investment philosophy.\n\nCorpGov: For those not familiar with Argo, would you please explain your investment philosophy?\n\nJason Zibarras: Argo was founded as an independent infrastructure private equity manager to invest in high-quality infrastructure assets with contracted, regulated or concessioned features. Argo has invested in 5 utility companies with over 600,000 customers, over ~3 GW of power generation and transmission resources, an energy storage network, 40 data centers and over 4,000 managed parking and motorway services facilities. Argo\u2019s 18 portfolio companies have over 15,000 operating employees and operations in 42 states.\n\nOur national presence, the scale of our portfolio and our understanding of the nexus between power markets and data centers, including the criticality of power availability the industry is facing today, positioned us well to underwrite the TierPoint investment and growth. TierPoint\u2019s robust contractual revenue profile, $1.6bn of investment-grade debt profile and environmental stewardship, fully align with Argo\u2019s long-term sustainable infrastructure thesis.\n\nCorpGov: For those not familiar with TierPoint, would you please explain what the company does?\n\nBrice Soucy: TierPoint, founded in 2010, is an enterprise-class data center operator with 40 data centers in 20 markets, connected by a coast-to-coast fiber network providing services to over 3,000 customers.\n\nTierPoint offers a full range of solutions for enterprise customers, including mission-critical enterprise and high-density colocation, network,\u00a0interconnection, cloud and managed services.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorpGov: Let\u2019s talk more about the data center industry. There has been considerable media coverage about their increasing importance in the digital economy. What are some of the factors driving growth?\n\nJason Zibarras: Almost all things digital rely on data centers. Several macro trends are driving demand for data center services by enterprises, including the rapid adoption of cloud computing, continued migration of enterprise workloads to off-premises data centers, emergence of compute-intensive workloads including artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing demand by content providers (including in edge markets). We see these trends materially contributing to growth for enterprise-class data centers by enabling enterprise clients to provide, store and traverse critical data in the medium term. Most pressing today, the AI gold rush is overtaking available processing power, further driving the need for more data centers. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the most prominent example of the incredible demand for processing power to enable AI; TierPoint\u2019s data centers are providing the picks-and-shovels as a conduit to enable AI workloads via high-density colocation.\n\nPerhaps the most recent example of this is the onboarding of CoreWeave as a customer, a specialized cloud provider built for large-scale, GPU-accelerated workloads who has worked closely with NVIDIA. In total, according to an April report from Thunder Said Energy (TSE), the internet will be the fastest-growing segment of the energy industry due to the acceleration of AI, and electricity demand will be up ~5X p.a. through 2030 (2.4% p.a. vs 0.5% in the past 20 years) in part due to the growth in demand for data centers. According to TSE, \u201ccombining the requirement to power data centers with broader ambitions in the energy transition would culminate in the most active expansion of the US power generation infrastructure that has ever occurred.\u201d We expect this to translate into opportunities for TierPoint and our other portfolio companies, including our utility and power generation assets, through the 2030 timeframe.\n\nCorpGov: What are TierPoint\u2019s competitive advantages and how is TierPoint positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-related infrastructure?\n\nBrice Soucy: TierPoint has one of the largest customer sets in the industry, and historically over 50% of our growth has been fueled by increased demand from existing customers. Having a national portfolio is crucial to meet increasing demand; more than half of our customers deploy workloads in multiple TierPoint data centers, which will become increasingly relevant as workloads move to the edge and closer to the customer.\u00a0This is an area where we expect robust growth given the increase in peering traffic within TierPoint\u2019s target markets and the need for high-compute workloads with low latency and close proximity to the customer, including enabling the movement of content and being a conduit between the end user and the content supplier.\n\nTierPoint has one of the best track records for both energy-efficient and reliable operations in the industry. For example, TierPoint achieved 100% uptime of critical systems in 2023, and TierPoint\u2019s data centers exceed industry standards for information security.\n\nTierPoint continues to adjust to technological changes and advances by automating and augmenting its product set. We believe TierPoint is on the cutting edge with its offerings and will continue to focus on this as the company grows to ensure they are able to meet the growing needs of its customer base. As an example, TierPoint enables its clients\u2019 compliant solutions. We have large healthcare practices for which we preserve and assist with critical data from hospitals, healthcare providers and other sources. We also provide similar services for our government and financial services clients, who have comparable regulatory and security requirements for their data.\n\nSince the emergence of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence / machine learning workloads, TierPoint has developed a proven and unparalleled track record for providing high-density colocation to support the most demanding workloads in its target markets. TierPoint has become a trusted partner of choice through its use of modern efficient cooling technologies and efficient rack design. They are able to lower operating temperatures and boost system performance, resulting in both capital and operating expense savings for customers, while helping customers prioritize sustainability by enabling heightened energy efficiency.\n\nCorpGov: The press release announcing Argo\u2019s majority investment in TierPoint stated that this is Argo\u2019s \u201cflagship digital investment.\u201d Jason, would you provide some insight into your investment process and why you have such strong conviction making this investment?\n\nJason Zibarras: When I left J.P. Morgan, I founded Argo Infrastructure Partners with a specific investment philosophy in mind; one of the keys to that is investing in fundamentally strong, high-quality businesses providing critical/essential infrastructure with high growth potential underpinned by robust contractual frameworks. TierPoint is the exact type of investment we look for \u2013 a high-quality, essential infrastructure asset with incredibly strong macro tailwinds driving demand and a national presence able to capture them.\n\nCorpGov: What specific AI applications or workloads are driving the need for high-density colocation services?\n\nBrice Soucy: As TierPoint has stated on its blog, AI workloads can be used to train, execute and maintain artificial intelligence models. Different types of workloads are used to accomplish different tasks. AI models can be trained using historical data to analyze customer behavior, maintenance needs, and sales trends. \u00a0Predictive analytics and forecasting require a tremendous amount of computing power.\n\nIn simple terms, as referenced by TSE, the growth in demand will be driven by both AI training (which requires training energy to process historical data) and then AI querying (which is the use of the models, analogous to sending an email or conducting a Google search).\u00a0 AI querying will drive the majority of long-term growth and according to TSE is expected to increase to ~350bn queries per day by 2045, comparable to today\u2019s daily email traffic, especially as compute-intensity increases over time.\n\nCorpGov: What is your expectation of the growth in the total addressable market (TAM) in the near and longer-term?\n\nBrice Soucy: Data center capacity, the power available to the IT systems it supports, can\u2019t be calculated with just one measurement. Multiple figures are combined to determine capacity, including space, power, cooling, computing resources and network connectivity.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey & Co. report, data center demand is forecasted to grow approximately 10% each year through 2030, reaching 35 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, a 77% increase from 2024.\n\nCorpGov: Can you elaborate on TierPoint\u2019s achievements in energy efficiency, including how it\u2019s addressing concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact?\n\nJason Zibarras: TierPoint has an unparalleled industry track record for reliable operations and energy efficiency, having achieved 100% uptime of critical systems and its lowest Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) in history in 2023. New build expansions can achieve even lower PUEs, 15-20% below the current portfolio PUE, by utilizing state-of-the-art design incorporating modern efficient cooling technologies and efficient rack design. TierPoint has also worked with customers to source local renewable energy capacity wherever possible.\n\nCorpGov: What challenges and opportunities do you foresee in the digital infrastructure landscape?\n\nBrice Soucy: Power availability represents the true nexus of infrastructure and data centers. According to the April report from TSE, there will be a need for 20 GW p.a. of new AI data centers through 2030 (150 GW total, including the demand for both AI training and querying), and Goldman Sachs research from April estimates this will translate into a $50 billion investment requirement over the same timeframe.\u00a0 What we foresee as an even greater challenge that is not being widely discussed in all the headlines about availability is power reliability. As TSE notes, \u201cAI data centers will look for reliable, around the clock power, to minimize the chance of volatility impacting their utilization rates.\u201d As infrastructure investors, we recognize what will be required to source, generate and transmit this reliable power going forward at the lowest levelized total cost of electricity. This will include investment in infrastructure supporting the energy transition to drive energy efficiency and potentially long-duration energy storage solutions that will provide additional reliability over time.\n\nCorpGov: How is Argo planning to help TierPoint expand its data center footprint?\n\nJason Zibarras: Over half of TierPoint\u2019s historical growth has come from existing customers, so we expect that a significant amount of future investment opportunity will come from expanding existing facilities to meet the needs of our current customer base. Additionally, we are finding unprecedented demand in TierPoint\u2019s markets for colocation as the broader market is forecast to grow at 10% p.a. through 2030. We believe it would not be an overstatement to double the size of the portfolio in the medium term to meet this demand through contracted expansions. We look forward to partnering with the Company, our managed investors and securitization investor partners to fund this expansion over the medium term.\n\nContact:\n\nCorpGov.com\n\nEditor@CorpGov.com\n\nThe post Argo Infrastructure Partners on Powering the AI Gold Rush Through Data Centers appeared first on CorpGov.\n\nView comments",

KEYS recently introduced two advanced higher power modules, the MP4351A and the MP4352A, to expand the capabilities of its MP4300A Series Modular Solar Array Simulator (SAS). The new mainframe and module models deliver an impressive 8.4 kW power capacity within just 2U of rack space. The high power density solution in a compact footprint reduces the capital expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe SAS platform boasts six-channel outputs with flexible power and performance options. This enables engineers to configure the system as per specific requirements. Moreover, the ability to control up to six channels through a single input-output port with a simple programmatic interface facilitates quick set-up and deployments of SAS systems. With high power density and regenerative power technology, the system delivers superior thermal performance. The solution has a wide range of realistic simulation features that efficiently mimic the rapid changes of conditions in space.\r\n\r\nExtremely high expenses and limited maintenance opportunities are major challenges for solar power spacecraft and satellites. Hence, engineers need a reliable power management system to ensure the smooth functioning of the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nSpace presents a unique and different environment and it is difficult to precisely emulate the conditions these systems will encounter in space. Usually photovoltaic (PV) emulation is utilized to observe the behavior of solar panels under different space situations. However, engineers require a precise validation technology to test the power management systems under various conditions using PV emulation.\r\n\r\nKeysight\u2019s newly launched modules, with their industry-leading power density and performance features, effectively meet these requirements. The innovative features of MP4300A SAS systems will support the validation of robust PV array systems, accelerate time to market, and mitigate the risk of errors during space operations. These will likely boost Keysight\u2019s prospect in aerospace and defense end markets in upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nShares of Keysight have lost 12.9% over the past year compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 3%.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of 40,720.64 on July 15. Despite the new record, the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the index are only up 8% in 2024, less than half the S&P 500.\n\nGone are the days when investors considered these 30 Dow stocks the best investments you could own for the long haul. Technology certainly has had something to do with the changing of the guard. The same could be said for consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nToday\u2019s blue chips are not necessarily the Dow 30. They\u2019re stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with growth potential for years, if not decades, to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, if you buy blue-chip stocks in July, it should be one of these three alternatives to Dow 30 stocks. Each operates in the same sector as the three Dow 30 stocks, with better prospective returns over the long haul.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinviz.com considers Costco (NASDAQ:COST) part of the consumer defensive sector. Others would say \u201cconsumer staples.\u201d That\u2019s neither here nor there. It is my blue-chip stock to buy as an alternative to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nJames Quincey became the CEO of Coca-Cola in January 2017 after 11 years at the company. In the past 7.5 years, he\u2019s been the beverage company\u2019s top leader, and its shares have appreciated by 54%. COST stock returned 427% in the same period, nearly eight times Coca-Cola\u2019s performance.\n\nI\u2019m a long-time Costco shopper. Its recent announcement that it would raise the annual membership fee Sept. 1 to $65 for its individual Gold Star and business members in the U.S. and Canada. Its premium memberships in the U.S. and Canada will rise to $130.\n\nThe stock fell on the news.\n\nHowever, considering it hasn\u2019t raised the membership fee since 2017 and is about two years past the five-year historical average, I\u2019m not sure how members or investors can be negative about the action taken.\n\nCostco has always been about providing consumers with the lowest prices possible, generating most of its profits from membership fees. Compared to beverage companies Coke and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which have gone hog wild on price increases over the past two years, Costco has held its prices steady.\n\nIt\u2019s a much better blue-chip stock.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is considered part of the consumer cyclical sector by Finviz.com. Others would say \u201cconsumer discretionary.\u201d It is one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy as an alternative to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nFirst, if you want to own a restaurant stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) would be a better choice given its pricing power, but I digress.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn May, the company reported Q1 2024 results that included earnings per share of 93 cents, 22.4% higher than a year ago and five cents better than analyst expectations. Revenue increased by 5.9% year-over-year to $12.48 billion. However, some investors focused on the 3.0% same-store sales growth in the quarter, 70 basis points less than the Wall Street consensus.\n\nFor the second quarter, it sees an EPS of 89 cents at the midpoint of guidance, five cents shy of analyst expectations. One analyst, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe, sees this as a case of \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe guidance remains conservative, and continue to see a favorable buying environment for [TJX\u2019s stock],\u201d MarketWatch reported Tarlowe\u2019s comments to clients.\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s prices have risen, the restaurant chain has struggled to keep low-income customers buying its products. TJX is the better blue-chip stock to buy.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is part of the communication services sector. I\u2019m making a controversial call by selecting it as a better blue-chip stock to buy than Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\n\nThat\u2019s especially true since the social media platform\u2019s stock struggled in the past month, down over 7%. However, over the past five years, despite underperforming relative to the index, PINS stock gained 59%, 89 percentage points better than Disney.\n\nFurther, with the country divided, it\u2019s about the only social media platform whose user interactions aren\u2019t completely unhealthy and uncalled for. It\u2019s very good for the future. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its earnings jumped 150%. FactSet estimates suggest that they\u2019ll rise 32% YOY in Q2, 23% in Q3 and 19% for Q4, with revenue growth over this period of 19.5% per quarter.\n\n\u201c\u2018Thanks to our investments in AI (artificial intelligence) and shopability, we\u2019re driving even greater returns for advertisers and gaining access to performance budgets,\u2019 said Bill Ready, Pinterest CEO, in its earnings recent report. The company generates revenue from online ads,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported.\n\nI might be an outlier, but I believe its stock will outperform Disney over the next five years like it did the past five. That makes it a top blue-chip stock to buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

On Wednesday, their momentum came to a screeching halt.\n\nThe three stocks were down more than 5% in midday trading on Wednesday for reasons ranging from investor concern over export restrictions to a broader rotation out of tech stocks. Chip stocks plummeted on Wednesday as the Biden administration reportedly mulled tighter restrictions on China and Republican candidate Donald Trump hinted Taiwan should pay for US defense against any Chinese aggression.\n\nOne headwind that emerged was the potential for tighter restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to China.\n\nBloomberg reported the Biden administration is considering implementing a more severe curb involving controls on foreign-manufactured products that use even the smallest amount of American technology.\n\nCurrent restrictions have already impacted US-based companies\u2019 ability to sell to China. Nvidia sales to China decreased as a percentage of total data center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\n\nASML stock saw the steepest decline on Wednesday, falling as much as 11%.\n\nShares of the Netherlands-based chip equipment maker were also pressured following its third quarter guidance.\n\nWhile ASML beat its second quarter top- and bottom-line expectations, its revenue forecast for the current quarter came in shy of the consensus analyst estimate.\n\nThe company also said it expects quarterly gross margin in the range of 50% to 51% versus Wall Street expectations of 51.1%. Exterior view of one of the buildings in the ASML complex in Veldhoven, Netherlands, Monday, Jan. 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Peter Dejong) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nAlso dragging down chip stocks were comments from former president Donald Trump, who said Taiwan \"should pay\" the US for protection against any aggression from China.\n\n\u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn\u2019t give us anything,\u201d Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek in an interview published on Tuesday.\n\nHe also said Taiwan took \"about 100%\" of the US chip business.\n\nTrump's comments sent shares of chip manufacturing and design giant TSMC plummeting more than 7% on Wednesday.\n\nMany chipmakers, including Nvidia, depend on Tawain for manufacturing. The island located east of China is a major semiconductor hub with roughly 92% of the world\u2019s most advanced chipmaking capacity, according to the US International Trade Commission.\n\nIt's worth noting shares of semiconductor companies Intel (INTC) and GlobalFoundries (GFS) were up during the session. Both companies are seen beneficiaries of the Biden administration's push to onshore chip production to the US.\n\nThe semis sell-off comes as investors have recently rotated out of big-cap names into small-cap stocks.\n\nThe rotation out technology began last week after the latest inflation print gave investors more optimism that the Federal Reserve would start cutting rates in September.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Russell 2000 (^RUT) outperformed large-cap stocks on the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) for five straight days as of Tuesday's close.\n\nOn Wednesday the small-cap index was down more than 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down more than 2%.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Down Today",
        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Stock Is Down Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 6.1% in the morning session after Bloomberg reported that the Biden Administration is planning to implement tighter trade restrictions if semiconductor companies continue granting China access to technologies made in the United States. The report follows ongoing trade tensions between both countries, which might raise uncertainty about market dynamics in the semiconductor segment heading into the new earnings season.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago, when the stock dropped 5.8% as investors seemed to be rotating out of large-cap tech stocks that have been winners year-to-date.\u00a0 We observed that the Russell 2000 Index rose 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by the inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).\n\nThe recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nNvidia is up 143% since the beginning of the year, but at $116.94 per share it is still trading 13.8% below its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $27,561.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "Thanks to generative AI technologies and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a chip giant supplying much of the technology required to bring in the AI revolution, AI stocks are a hot commodity this year.\n\nAdditionally, the technology behind generative AI continues to improve. It now has models that can make high-quality movies and pictures. Applied AI research company, Runway, for example, is leading the way with new generative video models that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) are considering for film usage.\n\nMoreover, a recent McKinsey survey found that creative AI is being employed in marketing, sales, and IT. Due to this acceptance, human resources costs are down, and supply chain and inventory management revenue is rising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowing from 36.6% to 36.8% yearly, the global AI industry is predicted to reach $1.345 trillion to $1.811 trillion by 2030. Certain forecasts see the market reaching $2.740 trillion by 2032, making AI stocks vital to future-proof any portfolio.\n\nNorth America dominates AI due to major AI stocks based in the region, robust research institutes, and attractive investment circumstances. The region earned 36.8% of global AI revenue in 2022. However, Asia-Pacific will also see significant growth in this area.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at three \u201cstrong buy\u201d AI stocks with double-digit upsides, all of which hold plenty of firepower to make a run for their 52-week highs.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares are down 29% in 2024 as investors worry about falling margins and retention rates, placing it precariously among AI stocks. However, Snowflake can mount a comeback, and the stock shows an average price target of $200.97, indicating a 50% upside potential from its current price of $133.72.\n\nProduct innovations and key alliances will drive Snowflake\u2019s growth. Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI engine now has vector search, massive language models, and other advancements. These solutions let companies automate analytics and properly leverage corporate data to develop AI-powered applications.\u200b\n\nAdditionally, Snowflake now works more closely with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Low-code/no-code application development, data governance tools, Snowflake\u2019s Data Cloud, and Microsoft\u2019s AI are the partners\u2019 goals.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric and Snowflake enable Apache Iceberg and bidirectional data under their partnership. Using this link, customers may work with a single copy of their data in many formats, simplifying data management and platform compatibility.\u200b\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake also announced a deeper NVIDIA partnership at Summit 2024. This agreement allows enterprises to swiftly construct custom AI solutions by integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI business software into Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI platform.\n\nTo give advanced language models to its Data Cloud, Snowflake partnered with Mistral AI. This agreement allows Snowflake customers to leverage Mistral AI\u2019s robust language models, Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral Large, for AI applications.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up 11% this year, experts feel there is more space to expand; the average price target is $856.04, which is an 11.5% upside potential from the current price of $767.85.\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 financials from ServiceNow were robust. Having $1.82 EPS and $2.60 billion in sales, the company exceeded analysts\u2019 projections. ServiceNow was financially strong shown by its 13.59% return on equity and 20.34% net profit. The most recent financial results from ServiceNow show encouraging trends in the last three quarters, therefore validating its winning run.\n\nServiceNow unveiled its creative artificial intelligence technologies at Knowledge 2024 as well. These AI-powered improvements seek to automate and simplify several organizational processes in order to raise customer results.\n\nPlus, Clear Skye debuted Identity Governance and Administration 5.1 on ServiceNow. This version streamlines corporate operations and enhances identity security to provide consumers a safer, more consistent experience.\n\nExpanding their strategic alliance to provide consumers greater artificial intelligence freedom and options, ServiceNow and Microsoft are letting ServiceNow\u2019s platform interact with Microsoft\u2019s creative AI products, such as Azure OpenAI.\n\nAdditionally, Sonatype and ServiceNow are working to streamline software composition research. This will help companies manage open-source components and alliances, hence enhancing software security.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu\u2019s (NASDAQ:BIDU) first-quarter earnings did much to allay investor fears, which is why 13 out of 16 analysts covering the stock rate the Chinese tech giant a \u201cbuy.\u201d Consensus points to an average price target of $145.79, translating to a potential 56% upside.\n\nIn Q1 2024, core revenue rose 4% to $3.30 billion, while online marketing revenue was up 3% to $2.36 billion. Significant expansion of Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud company has driven a 6% year-over-year rise in non-online marketing income. Generative AI integration into the company\u2019s offerings is also showing promising outcomes.\n\nBaidu anticipates $4.79 billion in revenue and $2.69 EPS next quarter. The 2024 revenue forecast is $20.34 billion, up 8.76% from the previous year.\n\nThe business intends to keep investing in artificial intelligence and basic models, including the ERNIE Bot, which is supposed to generate fresh growth engines. Expanding its autonomous driving initiatives is another area of concentration for Baidu, which can help diversify its income sources and improve its market standing. Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go Robotaxi offering has grown very rapidly, thereby raising investor confidence.\n\nFurthermore, Baidu CEO Robin Li underlined the need to maintain a healthy relationship with Chinese authorities, which has allowed the business to negotiate legislative changes and keep its search and news feed products running smoothly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Buffett Believes Picking Stocks Can Be Risky: Consider Investing In These ETFs Instead\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett is known for making bold investment decisions, which have allowed him to become the world's eighth richest man, with a net worth of over $136 billion. But that isn't the reason behind Buffett's popularity among retail investors \u2013 it is his cost-effective investment strategies focused on a company\u2019s valuation rather than market noise.\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\n\nBuffett has repeatedly touted the risks involved in handpicking stocks, given the shifting market dynamics and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. Nonetheless, the Oracle of Omaha believes that investing in index funds can help mitigate the risks substantially.\n\n\"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" Buffett said during the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it. In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.\"\n\nAs one of the biggest supporters of value investing, Buffett also believes in maintaining a routine while investing in index funds, especially during volatile times. Buffett stated in 2019 that he instructed his trustee to invest 90% of his wealth into a low-cost S&P 500 index after passing away.\n\n\"Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin. ... American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe will do very well,\" Buffett added.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "title": "Ray Dalio Is Buying Shares of This Company. Should You Do the Same?",
        "content": "Ray Dalio is one of the most successful investors of all time. According to the CFA Institute, his hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, \"generated consistent outperformance over nearly three decades, a feat even more impressive when adjusted for risk and fees.\"\n\nAnd one of the biggest bets for Dalio's hedge fund is buying a superstar stock that minted numerous millionaires in recent years.\n\nThis superstar stock is now one of Bridgewater's biggest bets\n\nDalio's hedge fund regularly makes changes to its portfolio. Over the last reported quarter, it either bought more of or sold off all 20 of its top 20 positions. Some positions changed only slightly. Others were either hugely magnified or reduced considerably.\n\nPerhaps Bridgewater's biggest recent move has been loading up on Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. Last quarter, it owned roughly 2.7 million shares. Since then, however, the fund has more than doubled its position to around 7 million shares worth more than $600 million. Nvidia is now the fifth-largest bet in Bridgewater's publicly disclosed portfolio.\n\nBridgewater isn't new to Nvidia. It first started buying shares in the third quarter of 2023. Back then, the stock traded at a split-adjusted $50 per share. Now, they're priced above $120 share -- yet Bridgewater keeps buying more. What could be so attractive about the stock that Bridgewater keeps buying more even after its stock price has surged? It has everything to do with the swift emergence of next generation artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nNvidia stock is one of the best ways to bet on AI\n\nNvidia stock is on a tear. Its value has nearly tripled over the past 12 months. And over the past five years, its stock price roughly doubled every 12 months. This spectacular performance has been backed by the fundamentals. Over the last fiscal year, for example, revenue has more than doubled, while earnings per share grew by more than 600%.\n\nWhat is Nvidia's secret? It sits at the center of the global AI revolution. \"Since the start of last year,\" writes Fool.com contributor Dani Cook, \"Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the most sought-after chips by developers worldwide. Increased demand for AI services has caused Nvidia's earnings to soar as the market has required a seemingly endless supply of GPUs.\"\n\nWhile the company is exposed to other end markets, make no mistake: Nvidia's future will ride or die based on not only the trajectory of AI spending, but also the company's continued ability to produce the industry's most attractive components. In 2022, Nvidia generated nearly half of its revenue from gaming GPUs alone. Just 39% came from its data center GPUs, which power AI applications around the globe. Today, data center GPUs account for 87% of sales, with the remaining 13% coming from everything else, gaming included.\n\nStory continues\n\nBridgewater's big bet on Nvidia, therefore, should be interpreted solely as a bet on AI. The firm clearly believes that AI spending will continue to explode over the next decade. One market estimate from Gartner believes that AI chip spending will grow by 33% this year. Bridgewater also likely believes that Nvidia will retain its leading market position. Current estimates show the company's AI accelerators have between 70% and 95% of the market share for artificial intelligence chips.\n\nBut there's growing competition. Even Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, is \"worried and concerned\" about whether Nvidia can retain its edge, adding that he knows \"people are trying to put me out of business.\" Over the decades, the chip wars have produced many cycles of winners and losers. Nvidia has the early lead on this massive and growing market, and Bridgewater is clearly a fan. But investors must be comfortable not only with the stock's high price tag -- shares trade with a $3.1 trillion market cap and a 40 times sales valuation multiple -- but also the company's long-term ability to meet the AI industry's growing and evolving demand for critical components like chips.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Stocks to Buy: 7 Founder-Led Companies Set to Outperform",
        "content": "What would you say if there was a reliable, evergreen indicator that a company will consistently out-innovate its competitors and, by extension, have a greater chance of long-term survival and market outperformance? While it may seem a pipe dream, research indicates that founder-led companies do just that, creating a unique set of parameters when looking for stocks to buy.\n\nA 2016 study found that \u201cthe innovations of founder CEO-managed firms create more financial value than the innovations of professional CEO-managed firms;\u201d in other words, when a company\u2019s founder is at the helm, the company is more likely to take the types of risk that companies must embrace if they\u2019re to maintain a competitive edge. Oftentimes, the managerial and professional CEO class is content to keep a company on the same trajectory, if not tweak operations solely for financial engineering purposes.\n\nJust look to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) for proof positive of how professional CEOs can tank a company\u2019s value proposition: Sundar Pichai made his bones with consulting firm McKinsey, whose alumni are notorious for a focus on bean counting over innovation (and even product safety), before moving up Google\u2019s corporate ladder to his current position. Today, Google is derided for slipping search efficacy \u2014 not to mention falling behind in the race toward artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn contrast, these founder-led companies remain at the cutting edge of their respective industries. And, if history is any indication, these founder-led companies are also set to outperform most.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of today\u2019s top founder-led companies, the first name that likely pops up is Elon Musk. SpaceX, Neuralink, and, of course, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are just a few companies Musk founded and still runs today. And, even with the recent robotaxi delay drama, Tesla has plenty of upside in the near future.\n\nMany point to Tesla\u2019s recent sales slump as evidence supporting their bear thesis \u2014 whether poor product quality, Musk\u2019s perceived inherent risk factors, or just plain antagonism toward the stock. However, looking at Tesla sales as a standalone measure is a misguided metric. Fewer than 20% of new car buyers pay cash, instead preferring financing. Today, new car loan interest rates are bumping up against 9%. Considering these macro factors, is it any wonder Tesla is selling fewer cars? As rates stabilize and fall, expect consumers waiting for improved financing terms to flock to Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Tesla is rapidly reducing production costs, which will expand the company\u2019s market share as it can target budget-minded buyers with lower-priced vehicles. Factor in artificial intelligence, robotics and a range of profitable peripheral endeavors and it\u2019s clear that Musk and Tesla fit the founder-led companies paradigm to a T.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf Tesla wasn\u2019t enough to hammer home the strength in founder-led companies, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) should do the trick. Founded more than 30 years ago by Jensen Huang, Huang\u2019s long-term outlook, patience, and willingness to identify and innovate toward emerging tech trends \u2014 artificial intelligence in particular \u2014 benefited shareholders and customers alike.\n\nI don\u2019t need to rehash Nvidia\u2019s shocking performance over the past two years, nor the catalysts, but instead want to look at Huang\u2019s unique approach to management and steering the company forward. Huang emphasizes his humble beginnings often, pointing to time spent bussing tables as a teenager as a major contributor to today\u2019s work ethic and willingness to dive into the dirty details to make sure products and processes are on point.\n\nMoreover, Huang isn\u2019t content to rest on his laurels like so much of the professional-managerial CEO class \u2014 he\u2019s actively looking to \u201cfutureproof\u201d Nvidia in a bid to protect his current empire and help it adapt and evolve with the times. This commitment to excellence and, more importantly, a long-term view of things is rare in a market more focused on quarter-to-quarter outcomes than multi-year game plans. That\u2019s yet another reason to fall back on founder-led companies.\n\nFigs (FIGS) Person holding smartphone with logo of US healthcare apparel company Figs Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFigs (NYSE:FIGS) faced a particularly trying few years after peaking at nearly $50 per share following its 2021 IPO, only to drop to around $6 per share today. But the drastic per-share price dip conceals a major advantage that could reverse its fortune. Figs counts itself among founder-led companies, created in 2013 and jointly run by the founders Heather Hasson and Trina Spear today, but also facing near-inevitable market share dominance.\n\nFigs makes higher-end uniforms for healthcare professionals, essentially trying to do for scrubs what Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU). However, the company faced stiff competition from the nation\u2019s largest scrubs company, Careismatic Brands, which dominates as much as half of the overall market. But Careismatic fell on hard times and just emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last month. Successfully navigating bankruptcy comes with a price \u2014 which is already apparent after the company laid off staff and closed distribution centers in May.\n\nThis shakeup, of course, works to Figs\u2019 benefit: The company is primed to snatch up market share from Careismatic. One interview with Spear highlighted the unique approach to targeting its total addressable market (TAM) that typifies founder-led companies, as she said \u201clazy companies sell into TAM, and innovative companies create TAM.\u201d Careismatic\u2019s stumbles may end up creating the biggest TAM of all for Figs moving forward.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFew have as close a bead on the wider biotech market as scientists involved in the industry, making Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) unique among founder-led companies. Led today by co-founders George Yancopoulos and Leonard Schleifer, the CEO and president/chief science officer, respectively. Regeneron is also unique among biotech stocks in its relative stability in a volatile sector. In fact, its beta is just 0.13, which is shockingly low for any stock \u2014 let alone one in the biotech field.\n\nOne of Regeneron\u2019s recent successes is the August 2023 FDA approval for a high-dosage version of its eye disease treatment, Eylea. This approval strengthens Regeneron\u2019s competitive position and helps mitigate the impact of Medicare price negotiations on the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s future also looks promising due to its other therapeutics, especially Dupixent. Initially used to treat asthma and eczema, Dupixent is now in Phase 3 trials for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early results are promising, showing a 34% reduction in symptoms. Given Dupixent\u2019s current success, analysts project that expanding its use to COPD could drive sales to $20 billion annually.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs with biotech, few understand cybersecurity\u2019s nuances as techies. Crowdstrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of those high-end cybersecurity firms that also meets the parameters of founder-led companies, run today by co-founder George Kurtz.\n\nTo that end, businesses today face myriad challenges, from geopolitical conflicts and natural disasters to supply chain disruptions. However, regardless of size, cyber threats remain the top global risk for most business owners. Concerns about cyber attacks, data breaches, digital infrastructure vulnerabilities, and ransomware are paramount.\n\nCrowdstrike is uniquely positioned to tackle these escalating threats, even beyond its status among founder-led companies. As technological advancements demand more robust security measures, Crowdstrike\u2019s comprehensive solutions are lynchpins to company success, making switching costs too steep for most firms and further entrenching its market share positioning. The company already boasts a diverse clientele, including government agencies, corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s impressive financial performance reinforces the founder-led company thesis. The company has seen significant revenue growth over the past five quarters, with the last four marking its first consecutive profitable periods. These steady income increases, especially in the current economic climate, indicate a promising future for Crowdstrike as it continues to dominate the digital security landscape.\n\nOn Holding (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Holding (NYSE:ONON) is doing what competitors like Allbirds (NASDAQ:BIRD) and even Nike (NYSE:NKE) simply can\u2019t these days: adapting to changing consumer trends while maintaining a sufficiently high price point and popularity to keep margins high. All three co-founders also have executive positions in the company today, making On Holding one of the top founder-led companies to watch.\n\nMost interestingly, On\u2019s apparel segment sales climbed 25% in the company\u2019s first-quarter report, yet apparel makes up less than 4% of total sales. On is still a relatively new shoe brand and, on its current trajectory, will likely rapidly expand its apparel segment to more closely match shoe sales and ultimately boost top and bottom-line numbers. By comparison, Nike\u2019s apparel segment comprised more than 25% of total sales. So, by using Nike as a basis for comparison, On Holding has plenty of room to grow peripheral sales streams even as it expands its current 8% share of the US market. To the latter point, On owns 40% of the running shoe market in its home country, Switzerland, creating a blueprint for further US penetration.\n\nHyatt Hotels (H) Hyatt Hotels (H) building with logo in front of shrubbery\n\nSource: EQRoy/Shutterstock.com\n\nHyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) is a bit of an outlier on this list of founder-led companies. The brand\u2019s first hotel opened in 1954, and Jay Pritzker brought the soon-to-be chain and rapidly turned it into an international brand. Though Jay Pritzker passed in 1999, management has kept it in the family \u2014 with Jay\u2019s son, Thomas Pritzker, acting as executive chairman today. Hotel stocks are already seeing a resurgence if travel ETF AdvisorShares Hotel ETF (NYSEARCA:BEDZ) is any indication. Likewise, Hyatt, in particular, is set to rebound rapidly, as evidenced by its 20% gain since January.\n\nHyatt holds less than 10% of the global hotel market share, eclipsed by competitors like Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) at 30%, luxury and destination brand Loews Hotels (NYSE:L) at 20%, and even Hilton (NYSE:HLT) at 13%. But that will likely change soon, as Hyatt has more than 125,000 new rooms in its development pipeline or a 40% increase over current availability. The rapid expansion of this type in a relatively constrained economy is nearly unheard of, let alone for a cyclical industry like hotels and travel \u2014 but Hyatt is bucking the wider trend in a bid to bounce back faster than competitors as wider macro conditions improve.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in FIGS.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy if Nvidia Pulls Back",
        "content": "Over the last couple of months, there have been a few wobbles here and there in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock\u2019s trading stability. Part of this could be a result of institutional investors taking profits or insiders making gains on their positions, but ultimately it underlines the reality that at any given time the speculation around Nvidia stock could change in the opposite direction.\n\nThat\u2019s because much of the company\u2019s value has been derived from investor excitement, institutional investment and an overall bullish perspective on its contributions to the broader tech industry moving forward.\n\nSo investors may want to consider which stocks to buy in case Nvidia pulls back. That\u2019s because once its price starts to dip, the selloff would likely result in re-investments in other, perhaps cheaper and more undervalued members of the tech industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne way to interpret a Nvidia pullback would be to determine whether its major competitors have finally caught up to its technology. Of all of these competitors, the one that is arguably the closest is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nWhile the company still has a ways to go in terms of its data center graphics processing unit offerings any future sign that its revenue is increasing as Nvidia\u2019s GPU revenue, decreases even slightly would be cause for buying AMD as it levels the AI playing field.\n\nMoreover, many of the company\u2019s technological offerings are incredibly competent and have their own advantages aside from tending to be cheaper than their direct counterparts from Nvidia. This in and of itself could be enough to begin chipping away, and every market share over time. So, should Nvidia stock start to dip over the long run, jumping ship to AMD could be a better growth trajectory.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nWhile Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) might not be the most obvious direct competitors, there is something to be said about the new Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) designed processing chips which Intel could use to break into the GPU sector. That\u2019s a trend most of the consumer electronics industry is beginning to buy into as well.\n\nEven though Nvidia saw this trend coming and has designed several of its GPUs to be interchangeably used with both x86 architecture and Arm architecture, it could experience a slight dip in consumer electronics revenues, such as gaming GPUs.\n\nThat\u2019s because Intel\u2019s Arm-designed chips could end up being more powerful, efficient and attractive for lightweight gaming devices like laptops. In these cases, the large, bulky and power-consuming GPUs designed by Nvidia for consumer applications, might not be as competitive in the future. Should this development occur, INTC stock could become a growth stock once more as it siphons revenues from NVDA.\n\nStory continues\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs previously mentioned, should Nvidia start to lose share value it could be a sign that a company like Arm Holdings and its computer architecture is outcompeting NVDA in the consumer market. As a result, it would be a good time to buy ARM stock to capitalize on the ensuing bullrush.\n\nThat\u2019s because ARM\u2019s chip architecture continuously moves closer to becoming the industry standard across portable devices. This is likely because ARM-designed chips are more power efficient than the traditional x86 architecture employed by the vast majority of chip designers today.\n\nWhile Nvidia has started to prepare for this eventuality, it\u2019s only a matter of time before ARM-designed GPUs outcompete its designs. Thus, NVDA will either have to share generous amounts of its profits with ARM in the future or design its own chip architecture to compete. As a result, ARM stock could be a great alternative to NVDA\u2019s growth in the event of a pullback.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "This chipmaker's results this week are critical for the semi sector: analysts",
        "content": "A Mizuho analyst stated that the semiconductor sector faces a critical test this week, with the upcoming developments likely to shape its future trajectory.\n\nThe investment bank highlighted several factors, which could potentially impact companies like ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035), BE Semiconductor Industries NV (AS:BESI), ASM International NV (AS:ASMI), and others.\n\nFirstly, Mizuho\u2019s report points out that the U.S. government is considering further restrictions on semiconductor equipment sales to China. This includes non-U.S.-made tools from companies such as ASML and Tokyo Electron.\n\n\u201cUS government wants to do anything and everything they can to hurt China domestic advanced semi manufacturing and evolution,\u201d the analyst said.\n\n\u201cNo talk of lagging edge equipment restrictions or further export bans for US semi-cap equipment suppliers. This looks and feels like Biden wanting to look tougher against China into election and the DNC next month,\u201d they added.\n\nThe restrictions would likely affect ASML significantly, especially given that 49% of their Q2 revenues came from China, albeit not from their EUV equipment.\n\nASML's recent earnings report, while showing strong Q2 results, provided underwhelming guidance for Q3. Despite beating Q2 expectations, the Q3 outlook fell short, largely due to revenue recognition timing.\n\n\"ASML reiterated the prior CY24 and CY25 revenue guides, so the weaker Q3 is pure revenue recognition timing,\u201d the analyst noted. The press on tighter U.S. restrictions into China for semiconductors has overshadowed these results, contributing to a sell-off in the sector.\n\nMoreover, Mizuho reflected on former President Donald Trump's recent comments in a Businessweek interview, which raised concerns about U.S. defense commitments to Taiwan. Trump suggested that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for its defense, a statement that rekindled investor fears regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and the broader geopolitical tensions.\n\n\u201cAll this does is raise past concerns amongst investors on TSM from China invasion or disruption risk. These concerns were high in 2023, but faded as AI strength and growth has over-shadowed all this geo-political risk,\u201d Mizuho\u2019s analyst commented.\n\n\u201cI think Trump forgets that anything happens to TSM in Taiwan and no one gets a new iPhone or Macbook and new Samsung (KS:005930) / Android handsets also sort of disappear. Might anger the US electorate a bit, right. And US cloud companies get no GPUs or AI silicon either.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the flip side, the analyst also highlighted the potential beneficiaries of the U.S. restricting semiconductor equipment sales to China, most notably Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) as possible \"winners.\" Despite this, they retain a cautious stance on these names.\n\n\u201cI am not a buyer of either really on any of this, especially INTC. MU [Micron] heavily US based, but down 4% as part of the AI semi unwind.\u201d\n\nOverall, Mizuho stressed that all of the aforementioned factors place a lot more emphasis on how TSMC\u2019s upcoming earnings results and guidance. More importantly, the manufacturer\u2019s commentary on AI, broader foundry market trends, pricing trends, capital expenditure, and non-AI order trends, will be essential.\n\n\u201cHow TSM stock trades tomorrow will be critical for the next move in semi sector,\u201d the analyst emphasized. \u201cAnything negative or worrisome accelerates the de-risk trade in my view.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to be honest, the de-risk trade in semis could be much more a factor rotation out of Tech winners YTD and into rate-sensitive laggards.\u201d\n\nThe weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is particularly telling, as all checks on their fundamentals remain strong, yet the stock has been grinding lower on days when non-tech sectors rally.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChipmaker's results this week are critical for the semi sector: analysts\n\nUS online sales hit $7.2 billion on first day of Amazon Prime Day event, Adobe says\n\nNetflix's efforts to grow ad tier in focus as subscriber growth slows\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "After soaring a whopping 194% over the last 12 months, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has richly rewarded its near-term investors as it rides a wave of explosive demand for AI hardware. But so far, this industry has been more hype than substance, and Wall Street is beginning to notice. Let's dig deeper into what the next year could have in store for Nvidia as hype fades and fundamentals start to play a bigger role.\n\nAnalysts are starting to sound the alarm\n\nIn late 2022 and early 2023, financial media was awash with grandiose visions for the future of AI. PwC expected it to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. And Bloomberg Intelligence projected the market to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032 as the new technology was applied to digital ads, software development, and other services. But now, some on Wall Street are beginning to sing a different tune.\n\nIn June, Goldman Sachs released a report suggesting that the roughly $1 trillion in capital expenditures (capex) expected to pour into AI hardware over the coming years may exceed the potential returns. And they have a point.\n\nSo far, most consumer-facing generative AI start-ups are generating significant losses. And over the longer term, free, open-source large language models (LLMs) could also commodify the technology, eroding the economic moats for early leaders. This would hurt Nvidia because if its software clients don't profit from their AI investments, eventually, they will stop spending. But so far, there is no evidence of a slowdown.\n\nThe cracks haven't appeared yet\n\nThe good news for Nvidia shareholders is that if the company faces impending doom, there are no signs of it yet. The chipmaker's rocket-ship rally is still backed by incredible operational performance.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue doubled year over year to $13.51 billion, driven by a 171% increase in the data-center segment where Nvidia sells its highest-end graphics processing units (GPUs), like the H100 and A100 used to train and run AI algorithms. For now, supply seems to be outstripping demand. And the company's gross margin increased from 64.6% to 70.1%, while its profits jumped 843% to $6.19 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThat said, the AI boom is getting a little long in the tooth. Over the next 12 months, Nvidia will face difficult comps as it tries to maintain growth against already high prior-year numbers. This could eat away at the stock's valuation, which seems to be pricing in continued expansion. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49, Nvidia trades at a significant premium over the Nasdaq 100's forward estimate of around 30.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nIt can be tempting to bet on Nvidia because of its practically exponential stock-price growth and the recent 10-for-1 stock split which makes the $3.18 billion company look deceptively affordable. However, investors who buy now are very late to the party and run the risk of holding the bag if things go wrong.\n\nOver the next 12 months and beyond, the AI industry may face a reckoning as hype begins to fade and consumer-facing applications struggle to show enough revenue and earnings potential to justify the industry's spending on chips and other hardware. These challenges could put Nvidia's valuation at risk. And investors may want to stay clear for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: Nvidia Will Climb in the Second Half Thanks to This 1 Game-Changing Move",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has been on fire for the past few years for a very good reason: The company's dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Nvidia holds an 80% share, and due to its commitment to innovation, this leadership could continue. All of this has translated into triple-digit earnings growth and investor optimism about the company's future.\n\nAnd that helped Nvidia continue its path higher this year, soaring nearly 150% in the first half. The stock has taken a bit of a pause in recent weeks following its stock split, but I don't think this lackluster performance will last for long. In fact, my prediction is Nvidia stock will climb in the second half thanks to one game-changing move the company is about to make. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's biggest business\n\nFirst, a quick recap of Nvidia's path so far. The tech giant sells the world's top-performing graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that drive the most essential AI tasks, and an entire ecosystem of products and services for customers developing AI projects. Nvidia's GPUs originally were most known for powering video games -- and the company still generates revenue here -- but today AI has become the company's biggest business.\n\nIn the recent quarter, data center revenue surged to a record of more than $22 billion -- that's on a total of $26 billion in revenue. Nvidia also is highly profitable, generating more than $14 billion in net income and growing gross margin to about 78% from 64% in the year-earlier period.\n\nAll of this has helped the stock advance not only this year but in recent years. Over the past five years, Nvidia has soared 2,900%, and the stock roared past $1,000 back in May. The company recently completed a 10-for-1 stock split, bringing down its shares to less than $130. Though this doesn't change anything fundamental about the company such as its market value or valuation, the move does make it easier for a broader range of investors to get in on the stock.\n\nAfter Nvidia's mind-blowing performance though, some investors worry the stock might lose its momentum. But here's the one game-changing move that could send this innovative player higher in the second half. I'm talking about Nvidia's upcoming launch of its Blackwell architecture and its best-performing chip yet. Demand for Blackwell already has surpassed supply, and the company expects this to continue into next year. The system is in production right now, with Nvidia aiming to make it globally available later this year.\n\nThe Blackwell rollout strategy\n\nThe company predicts \"fast and broad adoption\" across its range of customers and their projects thanks to its rollout strategy. More than 100 original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer systems will include Blackwell at the launch -- and every major computer maker will be part of this.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is Blackwell such a big deal? Because the architecture delivers 4 times faster training and 30 times faster inference than Nvidia's current top performer, the H100. And when customers save on time, they not only make their AI projects operational faster, but they also save on costs. In fact, Nvidia says Blackwell results in a 25 times lower total cost of ownership for a customer compared to its current Hopper architecture. So, Blackwell should be a major step forward for Nvidia and its customers.\n\nMy prediction for gains\n\nNow let's talk a little more about my prediction. Since Nvidia plans to release Blackwell later this year, I would expect to see the impact on revenue growth next year -- but I still think this launch could act as a positive catalyst for stock performance in the months to come, especially if Nvidia continues to report high demand in upcoming quarters. As investors anticipate earnings growth ahead, they may choose to get in on this stock now -- and potentially benefit as Blackwell revenue starts rolling in.\n\nI wouldn't expect Nvidia shares to replicate their triple-digit first-half performance, but considering the company's earnings growth over the past several quarters and the idea that Blackwell could serve as a significant new growth driver, I wouldn't be surprised to see Nvidia stock climb in the double digits in the second half. After all, analysts forecast average annual earnings-per-share growth of more than 46% over the coming five years.\n\nFinally, here's the best news of all: Even if I'm wrong and Nvidia stock falters in the second half, the company, thanks to its solid market position and innovation, has what it takes to benefit from AI growth over time -- and this could lead the stock significantly higher in the years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "With so many innovations available in the market, it\u2019s increasingly difficult for investors to pick out viable ideas. That\u2019s where exchange-traded funds come into play. With technology-centric ETFs to buy, buyers can enjoy a wealth of compelling opportunities under one basket. This is especially useful if you have concerns about making decisions.\n\nJust within the tech ecosystem itself, investors have myriad opportunities to choose from. Whether you\u2019re looking at artificial intelligence, semiconductors, cybersecurity or automated solutions, your interests may outweigh the funds available in your wallet. And then comes the more draining part: deciding which specific enterprise has the legs to go the distance.\n\nYou might love Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for example, but are concerned that it might be overstretched. Well, in that case, you can select a basket of securities that cover NVDA and other enticing prospects. You\u2019re spreading your bets and that may be a prudent decision. With that, below are tech-centric ETFs to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) AI. Circuit board. Technology background.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s get right into it. As you might imagine, iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) tracks the benchmark NYSE Semiconductor index, which comprises of U.S. chipmakers. It\u2019s one of the ideal plays among ETFs to buy because it\u2019s so difficult to choose among the individual brands. By acquiring units of the SOXX fund, investors enjoy exposure to a wide range of compelling ideas.\n\nAt the top of the holdings list stands Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). One of the top considerations for AVGO stock is its share split, which occurred late last week. With each share now priced at a more accessible level for retail investors, participation may increase. That\u2019s good for AVGO and that\u2019s also good for the SOXX ETF.\n\nComing in at number two is Nvidia. A lot of investors who missed the boat may have questions about its forward viability. With SOXX, you can get exposure to NVDA while enjoying the collective returns of many other attractive ideas in the semiconductor space. That\u2019s what makes this fund one of the top ETFs to buy.\n\nAmplify Cybersecurity ETF (HACK) a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related icons. cheap cybersecurity stocks. multibagger cybersecurity stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile everyone loves talking about the productivity gains from technology, people often forget that advances in digitalization also lead to productivity losses. Cybersecurity attacks have evolved from mere nuisances to causing severe financial and economic problems. From a cynical perspective, then, Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) ranks among the ETFs to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the issue with cybersecurity stocks is that there are so many of them. Further, they may have different niche strengths, from end-to-end enterprise-level services to cloud-network protection to solutions for individual computer users. It\u2019s difficult to know which idea will emerge as the runaway success story and that\u2019s where HACK comes into view.\n\nIts top holding is Broadcom, which offers its Symantec Enterprise Cloud solution. Coming in second place is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is an arguably underrated cybersecurity play. Rounding out the top three is Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is a leader in endpoint protection services.\n\nNot surprisingly, HACK is up over 11% on a year-to-date basis. However, investors should be aware that the expense ratio is a bit on the high side at 0.6%. In contrast, the category average is 0.53%.\n\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (ROBT) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nFor those that want to dial up their risk-reward profile, speculators should consider First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT). It\u2019s a mouthful but it\u2019s an intriguing concept. The ROBT fund tracks an index called the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics index. With so much money poured into the broader field of automation, ROBT presents a wide canvas.\n\nInterestingly, its top holding is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), which is an application software firm that promotes end-to-end intelligent workflow automation solutions for digital businesses. Analysts anticipate big growth for the company, with fiscal 2024 sales potentially rising by 21.4% to $10.89 billion. Coming in second is Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), a big data analytics firm. PLTR has been attracting the spotlight lately as it marches higher, backed by rising sales.\n\nStill, not everything is so rosy with ROBT. Before stepping foot into the arena, investors should realize that it\u2019s a low-volume fund. Further, the performance has been disappointing, only inching into positive territory for the year. Still, the speculation is that ROBT is one of the ETFs to buy based on its forward potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "3 Premier Stock-Split Stocks I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole in the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "Although the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has captivated Wall Street, don't overlook just how much of a catalyst companies enacting stock splits have been since the year began.\n\nA stock split provides a path for a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count. Splits are superficial in the sense that they have no effect on a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nStock splits come in two forms, forward and reverse, with investors undeniably favoring the former. With a forward-stock split, a public company is angling to make its shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is designed to increase a company's share price, which is usually done to ensure it meets the minimum listing standards of a major stock exchange. Since reverse splits are usually enacted in a position of weakness, investors typically flock to companies conducting forward-stock splits.\n\nSince 2024 began, around a dozen high-profile, time-tested businesses have announced and/or completed respective stock splits. While many of these stock-split stocks are well-positioned to deliver for their long-term shareholders, this isn't the case across the board.\n\nA combination of mounting headwinds and otherworldly valuation make the following three premier stock-split stocks wholly avoidable in the second half of 2024.\n\nNvidia\n\nThe first stock-split stock that I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole for the remainder of the year, and perhaps well beyond, is the hardware kingpin of the AI revolution, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's board announced a 10-for-1 forward split on May 22, which went into effect following the close of businesses on June 7.\n\nDespite being no fan of Nvidia's stock at its current valuation, I'll absolutely give credit where credit is due. The company's operating ramp has been virtually textbook and will likely be discussed in classrooms and on Wall Street for decades to come.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) also have a practical monopoly in AI-accelerated data centers. The analysts at TechInsights pegged Nvidia's share of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped in 2023 at (drumroll)... 98%!\n\nThe problems I have with Nvidia boil down to history, competition, and valuation.\n\nWith regard to the former, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation, technology, or trend for three decades that didn't endure an early innings bubble. While predicting when the euphoria will end is impossible, history is undefeated when it comes to investors overestimating the adoption and utility of new innovations.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Nvidia is contending with its first real bouts of AI-data center competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Further, its four biggest customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs for use in their data centers. Even if Nvidia's hardware remains superior to its competition, the presence of these externally and internally developed chips all but ensures less space in enterprise data centers for Nvidia's GPUs. It also likely marks an end to Nvidia's otherworldly pricing power for its AI-GPUs.\n\nLastly, Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is the stuff horror movies are made of. As of the closing bell on July 12, Nvidia was valued at 40 times TTM P/S, which is more or less in line with the peak TTM P/S ratios for Cisco Systems and Amazon prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Though it's impossible to pinpoint when a bubble will burst, all signs continue to point to Nvidia's stock being in one. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nA second high-flying stock-split stock that I'd suggest avoiding like the plague for the second half of 2024 is AI-driven enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). MicroStrategy's board declared a 10-for-1 forward split on July 11, with an effective date of August 7, following the close of trading.\n\nWhile MicroStrategy has had a software division for decades, it's best-known as the company that holds the most Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), the world largest cryptocurrency by market value. A June 20 update from the company showed that it held 226,331 Bitcoin, or 11,931 more tokens than it previously held as of the end of April. This represents more than 1% of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be mined.\n\nWhile investors -- and MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor -- are clearly excited about Bitcoin's future, there are some key reasons why this stock-split stock is worth avoiding.\n\nTo begin with, Bitcoin has lost the first-mover luster that once made it desirable. It's nowhere close to being the fastest or cheapest way to make digital payments; nor is it particularly scarce, with lines of computer code and community consensus being the only things standing in the way of a higher token count.\n\nBitcoin's real-world use case is lacking, too. Despite the repeated efforts of El Salvador's government to encourage the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, 88% of residents didn't use it as a form of payment in 2023.\n\nBut the biggest issue with MicroStrategy might just be the premium investors have attached to its stock. As of this writing on July 12, Bitcoin was trading at $57,853 per token. This works out to about $13.1 billion in market value for MicroStrategy's Bitcoin assets. However, investors have placed in the neighborhood of a $10 billion premium on the company's assets. Put another way, instead of buying Bitcoin for $57,853 per token on a crypto exchange, investors in MicroStrategy are paying close to $100,000 per Bitcoin, based on its assets.\n\nThe nail in the coffin is that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings have been financed by multiple convertible-debt offerings. If Bitcoin enters another steep bear market, there are no assurances the company will be able to meet its hefty debt obligations.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nThe third premier stock-split stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pile in the second half of 2024 is high-flying fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Chipotle's board approved a historic 50-for-1 stock split on March 19, which went into effect after the close of trading on June 25.\n\nSimilar to Nvidia, I'm not oblivious to the variety of ways Chipotle has out-innovated and out-executed its competition. Chipotle's promise to use responsibly raised meats and (when possible) locally sourced vegetables has led to a loyal customer base that's willing to pay a premium price for its food.\n\nFurthermore, Chipotle's addition of mobile order drive-thru lanes, known as \"Chipotlanes,\" has been a game-changer. These digital order lanes, coupled with the company purposely keeping its menu small, have improved internal operating efficiency in its restaurants.\n\nThe concerns I have with Chipotle primarily revolve around its valuation.\n\nAlthough I just talked up how the company's Chipotlanes have lifted its organic growth prospects, there's only so much innovation that can be expected from restaurant chains. While sales jumped 14.1% for the company during the first quarter, roughly half of this gain was the result of opening new restaurants.\n\nDigging into the proverbial burrito reveals comparable-restaurant sales growth of \"only\" 7%, of which 1.6% was the result of an increase in average check size. Though pricing power is an important aspect of any solid business, inflationary price hikes aren't worth a significant premium. As of the closing bell on July 12, investors were paying 43 times forward-year earnings for this 7% organic growth rate.\n\nTo add to this point, the stock market as a whole is at one of its priciest valuations when looking back more than a century. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings ratio is north of 36, which has historically been a signal that a bear market is coming. When the next sizable stock market correction does arrive, companies with premium valuations, like Chipotle, MicroStrategy, and Nvidia, are liable to be hit the hardest.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Either way, AMD has impressive catalysts and has proved it can keep up in the fast-moving world of AI hardware. In any case, AMD stock looks quite rich. It seems priced even more prosperous than its bigger brother, Nvidia.\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s one-month chart looks more enticing than Nvidia or almost any other AI stock that\u2019s in the process of correcting, I do see better value options elsewhere. And in this piece, we\u2019ll look at three growth stocks that could be better deals than AMD.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building. NVO stock\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the European biotech behind the GLP-1 drug that started it all: Ozempic. Following a recent comparative study that showed Eli Lilly\u2018s (NASDAQ:LLY) rival drug, Mounjaro had a slight edge over Ozempic for weight loss, questions linger as to whether NVO stock is still the best way to play the rise of weight-loss drugs.\n\nFollowing the report, NVO stock took a modest hit to the chin. Though discouraging, dip-buyers may wish to punch their ticket if they seek GLP-1 exposure at a slight single-digit percentage discount. Ozempic may no longer be the heavyweight champ (forgive the pun), but it can still pack a punch as demand stays elevated.\n\nAdditionally, the company is actively working on a successor to Ozempic. CagriSema is just one intriguing Phase III candidate that could be better than Ozempic and other first-generation GLP-1 drugs.\n\nOf course, only time will tell if it\u2019s a Novo candidate that captures the weight-loss market of the future. In any case, I\u2019d say that Novo is down but certainly not out after the latest study that saw Ozempic fall short.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a secretive big-data analytics company that could be one of the bigger enterprise software winners of the AI race. After the latest 20% past-month surge, PLTR stock seems to be in breakout mode. Whether the current leg pushes the name to new all-time highs not seen since 2021 remains to be seen.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently praised PLTR stock alongside some Magnificent Seven companies as tech stocks that could be \u201cstandouts\u201d in the second quarter. Undoubtedly, Palantir has already put up a handful of strong quarters. As the company looks to ride even higher on the AI wave, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to bet against Ives or PLTR stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s been winning some notable contracts lately (it won a deal with Voyager Space a few weeks ago) that can help support its impressive growth profile. Should Palantir be able to deliver in Q2, there\u2019s no telling how much higher the AI juggernaut could fly from here.\n\nVertiv (VRT) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Veritiv (VRTV).\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nVertiv (NYSE:VRT) is a data center play that ran into some turbulence in June. Though the negative momentum has slowed, VRT stock is still down more than 16% from its highs. Amid the turbulence, Hedgeye analyst Felix Wang stepped forward with a note referring to VRT stock as a short idea.\n\nWang highlighted that it was \u201cliquid cooling demand\u201d behind the latest meteoric rise in the stock. Additionally, he viewed sales and backlog expectations as \u201ctoo high at the moment,\u201d\n\nFor a growth stock that\u2019s risen close to 900% in the past two years (even with the recent correction considered), it\u2019s only wise to be cautious, even in the face of profound generational demand in the data center. However, shorting the name could prove dangerous as VRT stock could easily spike higher if the firm can smash past its next quarterly earnings due next week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell slightly in evening deals on Tuesday, with heavyweight technology stocks seeing a sustained pullback before key earnings from the sector due this week.\n\nStrong earnings, increased optimism over the U.S. economy and bets on lower interest rates also saw traders pivoting out of heavyweight tech stocks and into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,713.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.2% to 20,567.50 points by 19:37 ET (23:37 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 41,266.0 points.\n\nFocus also remained squarely on the 2024 presidential race after an attempt on Donald Trump's life over the weekend.\n\nASML, TSMC earnings on tap this week\n\nDutch lithography equipment maker ASML Holding (AS:ASML) NV (NASDAQ:ASML) and Taiwanese contract chipmaker TSMC (NYSE:TSM) are set to report their quarterly earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nBoth firms are considered bellwethers for the chipmaking industry, with their earnings set to offer more cues on demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nHype over AI was a key driver of Wall Street\u2019s rally over the past year, with technology stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) leading a major spike in valuation.\n\nBut this rally has somewhat cooled in recent sessions, with the upcoming earnings set to offer more signals for trade.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by traders collecting some profits in the sector and pivoting into more economically sensitive sectors.\n\nDow clocks best day in over a year on strong earnings, rate cut hopes\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average vastly outpaced its peers in recent sessions, surging 1.9% to a record closing high of 40,954.48 points on Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 0.6% to a record high of 5,666.98 points, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite lagged, rising 0.2% to 18,510.86 points.\n\nStrength on Wall Street was driven by a slew of strong earnings from big banks and insurers.\n\nThe earnings season is set to continue on Wednesday, with majors such as Johnson&Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL), Equifax Inc (NYSE:EFX) and Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD) set to report.\n\nOptimism over interest rate cuts also boosted U.S. stocks, as soft inflation readings and dovish-leaning comments from the Federal Reserve ratcheted up bets that the central bank will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nTraders are pricing in a 91.7% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, and a small chance for a 50 basis point cut, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nStory continues\n\nStronger-than-expected retail sales data did little to deter bets on interest rate cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures tick lower as tech turns skittish before key earnings\n\nPro Research: Wall Street eyes Autodesk amid strategic shifts\n\nASML's order book expected to jump on AI chip boom\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Bitcoin Bull Run May Lead to Stock Gains for COIN, SQ, NVDA",
        "content": "Since Bitcoin (BTC) was launched in 2009, it has witnessed an unprecedented rise from a penny to a record high of $73,750 on March 14. The Bitcoin halving event in April, however, failed to jack up its price. Instead, the price of BTC fell below $60,000 and entered correction territory the following month.\n\nBTC recently defied the bearish trend and bounced back above $63,000. BTC jumped 5.7% on July 15 to trade as high as $63.768, per Dow Jones Market Data. The price of BTC may still be well below its all-time high but has surged more than 50% this year. BTC\u2019s price has soared 12.6% in the last seven days raising speculation of an imminent substantial upswing.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u2013 Percentage Change (7d) Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIs the Bitcoin Bull Run Here?\n\nA plethora of factors are fueling the BTC surge. Donald Trump\u2019s recent unsuccessful assassination attempt bolstered the likelihood of him winning the presidential election this year. Trump is professed to be more welcoming to the crypto industry than Biden. He has started to accept donations in crypto for the presidential election campaign.\n\nBitcoin miners, meanwhile, are undergoing significant strain, which could compel them to shut down their operations. This will lead to less selling pressure on the crypto market and pave the way for a potential recovery in BTC price.\n\nMoreover, the absence of sustained downward pressure at the moment could enable the price of BTC to scale upward. This is because Bitcoin liquidations by the German government have concluded. On the other hand, for quite some time, Bitcoin whales have begun to acquire additional BTC, which could reduce the supply of BTC and lead to an uptick in price.\n\nLest we forget, both institutional and retail adoption of BTC will help the world\u2019s numero uno cryptocurrency\u2019s price to scale upward in the long run. Additionally, expectations of interest rate cuts as early as fall will lead to a weaker dollar and increase investors\u2019 interest in alternative assets such as BTC (read more: Rise in Rate-Cut Bets May Prompt Stock Gains for GOLD, KGC, FNV).\n\n3 Crypto Stocks on the Radar: COIN, SQ, NVDA\n\nWith the price of BTC set to move northward, things are looking hunky-dory for Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN, Block, Inc. SQ and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, which can make the most of the flagship cryptocurrency\u2019s bullish momentum.\n\nCoinbase\n\nCrypto-trading platform Coinbase, where several digital assets, including Bitcoin, are traded, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coinbase\u2019s next-year earnings has increased by 15.4% over the past 60 days. Coinbase\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 1,740.5%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 92%.\n\nBlock\n\nBlock is a digital payment company that generates revenues from products like Cash App. In this platform, Bitcoin is purchased and sold. Block currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Block\u2019s current-year earnings has increased by 0.7% over the past 60 days. Block\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 72.8%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 14.9%.\n\nNVIDIA\n\nSemiconductor behemoth NVIDIA is designing graphics processing units for mining cryptos such as Bitcoin. NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s current-year earnings has increased by 11.2% over the past 60 days. NVIDIA\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.2%. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current year is 93%.\n\nShares of Coinbase, Block and NVIDIA have gained 9.3%, 11.7% and 4%, respectively, month to date.

        "title": "Nvidia\u2019s market cap will soar to $50 trillion\u2014yes, trillion\u2014says early investor in Amazon and Tesla",
        "content": "Nvidia\u2019s rise has been astronomical\u2014it\u2019s grown its market capitalization from $1.1 trillion to $3.1 trillion in the past 12 months\u2014and a tech investor who predicted the early success of Amazon and Tesla said this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I\u2019ve ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions,\u201d James Anderson, former partner at investment giant Baillie Gifford, told the Financial Times. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia\u2019s lead is intact.\u201d\n\nThe chipmaker behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has soared thanks to the AI boom, which has minted half-a-million new millionaires who invested in the tech that has begun to revolutionize the workplace and media consumption. Nvidia, along with tech giants Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, are worth $14.5 trillion and make up about 32% of the S&P 500. With the AI darling\u2019s data center revenue growing at about 60%, Anderson calculated, should the pattern continue over the next decade, the company would have a market capitalization of about $49 trillion. That\u2019s more than the entire value of every company in the S&P 500, which is roughly $45.84 trillion. Anderson estimated a 10% to 15% probability of this outcome.\n\nAnderson\u2019s projection is a lofty one, but his hunches have proved correct before. With a go-big-or-go-home mentality, he was one of Amazon\u2019s and Tesla\u2019s biggest champions (for the EV giant, Anderson\u2019s investments were second only to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s). From 2005 to 2021, Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, managed by Baillie Gifford, saw returns of 2,240%. It invested in Nvidia in 2016. Lingotto Investment Management, where Anderson is now an investor, has a $650 million fund with Nvidia as its largest position.\n\nNvidia didn\u2019t have a clear path to success when Anderson first began investing in the company, he said. It remained to be seen if it would be a gaming, crypto, or AI company. But it did have the advantage of early success, unlike Amazon and Tesla, which \u201cdidn\u2019t start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there.\u201d In some ways, Anderson still sees Nvidia as a nimble company.\n\n\u201cIt is the long duration of the development of [graphic processing units] usage in AI\u2014and not just AI\u2014from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nNot so fast\n\nOther finance experts don\u2019t share Anderson\u2019s bullish take on Nvidia. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, argues Nvidia is riding a wave of early AI optimism.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe momentum is clearly with Nvidia,\u201d Damodaran told CNBC in May. \u201cThey can do nothing wrong. Everything they touch turns to gold.\u201d\n\nDamodaran said Tesla experienced a similar rally in 2020, when its market cap soared, peaking in 2021 at $1.2 trillion, only for shares to plummet about 30% this year alone. Meta and Google also grappled with increased competition that have loosened their grip on the tech world. While Nvidia has the earnings to back up its sky-high value, the expectations for the future of the company may be too steep, he argued. Damodaran said the AI chip market is not worth $1 trillion alone, and the AI market more broadly is worth about $2 trillion or $3 trillion, meaning Nvidia would have to tap into several big AI markets to maintain and grow its value.\n\n\u201cIt's clearly a possibility,\u201d Damodaran said. \u201cBut is it plausible? I don't think so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say if Nvidia has the juice to lead Big Tech into the AI frontier in the long term, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton said. Nvidia\u2019s colossal growth may appear scary, but it\u2019s sustainable, particularly as the demand for AI is expected to increase.\n\n\u201cDespite all of us worrying that eventually this demand for chips will slow down, we haven't really seen that slowdown happen yet,\u201d Clinton told Yahoo Finance last month. \u201cAnd it may take longer to slow down than we think.\u201d\n\nWith Nvidia making up over 80% of the global GPU semiconductor market, the company will likely continue to ride high in the foreseeable future, Clinton said.\n\n\u201cCan Nvidia maintain its dominant position providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?\u201d he said. \u201cI think they can for the next three to five years.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Graphcore, founded in 2016, is dedicated to building IPUs, intelligence processing units, a technology that could shape the future of AI.\n\nTrending: Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with just $100.\n\nWith the soaring demand for artificial intelligence and the remarkable success of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), investors are eagerly anticipating the potential of Graphcore\u2019s IPO. While it\u2019s not yet open for investment, the prospect of it becoming a publicly traded company is on the horizon. SoftBank\u2019s reported acquisition cost of around $600 million, below the $700 million it raised in venture capital, suggests a promising future. Despite Graphcore\u2019s current lack of profitability, the SoftBank acquisition provides the company with the stability to continue developing its pipeline of AI technologies without the constant need for capital.\n\nThe purchase of Graphcore was funded by SoftBank Group itself, not Son's Vision Fund. This decision, made by SoftBank\u2019s more venture capital-focused arm, could be seen as a vote of confidence in Graphcore\u2019s future. The fact that Graphcore was purchased through SoftBank Group, rather than the Vision Fund, may further bolster investor confidence in the company\u2019s potential. Graphcore CEO and co-founder Nigel Toon described the acquisition as a \"great outcome for the company,\" reinforcing the belief in its future.\n\nSpeaking at SoftBank's annual shareholder meeting last month, Masayoshi Son made it clear that he is focusing heavily on artificial intelligence. He said he intends to conquer the goal of creating artificial superintelligence (ASI). This concept is the idea that AI can surpass human learning, and he said that \"Masayoshi Son was born to make ASI a reality.\"\n\nPrivate credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class.\n\nA Mixed Track Record\n\nMasayoshi Son has been able to spot trends sometimes years before they become a complete reality, but that doesn't mean he's a flawless investor. In fact, SoftBank's Vision Fund invested in Nvidia but sold it in 2019. While the company made a substantial profit of $3.3 billion, it missed out on Nvidia's incredible run-up over the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it may redeem itself with Arm Holdings, which had its IPO less than a year ago and is already up nearly 200%. SoftBank owns 90% of the semiconductor design company and sees the investment as part of its move toward the future of AI.\n\nIt's safe to say that real estate is not a lucky charm for Masayoshi Son. One of Son's most significant errors was falling for the charms of WeWork founder Adam Neumann and investing billions of dollars in the company. The move cost SoftBank a reported $11.5 billion and became a black mark on Son's record. Another real estate-related investment in tech-focused brokerage Compass (NYSE:COMP) has not performed as expected. Since its IPO in 2021, the stock is down nearly 80%. SoftBank also invested in Katerra, a startup that was expected to be the future of modular construction. That company flamed out in 2021, filing for bankruptcy before ever going public and taking nearly $3 billion in investor money with it.\n\nAfter the Vision Fund posted a record $32 billion loss during its 2022 fiscal year., Son and his team tightened their belts, enacting massive job cuts. But those brutal results don't seem to have dampened Son's enthusiasm for investing. If he's right, the next giant leap in AI is right around the corner. If he's wrong, he risks losing the faith of SoftBank's investors as well as the millions around the world who follow his moves as a way to get a pulse on where the world is headed next.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly impact the global economy and business in the coming years. While some debate sustainability of the current AI-driven growth, investors and traders alike consider AI stocks to buy. With AI technology undoubtedly here to stay, this disruption will reshape the way we work, conduct business and invest.\n\nMultiple stocks have seen dramatic gains in recent years due to AI adoption. However, they may be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are getting the lion\u2019s share of headlines and investor interest as they battle it out for the leading edge. Yet, as with the dot-com boom, millionaire-making stocks haven\u2019t grown yet despite witnessing substantial returns.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add $2.6-4.4 trillion globally in the coming years, allowing ample room for stock growth. As AI applications and technologies become more pervasive, the overall economic benefits are projected to be sizable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile large companies make headlines, smaller players with consistent earnings and projected continued AI-enabled expansion may be worth examining. Let\u2019s explore three stocks to buy for long-term AI-driven returns.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the stocks to buy that has the potential to return millions is DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The technology firm provides data analytics and user authentication services for online companies. Its primary focus is helping advertisers reach audiences and achieve effective, quality returns on sales. The company uses AI to increase fraud detection capabilities. It also offers AI as a service to enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising and optimize strategies for individual businesses.\n\nWhat makes DoubleVerify attractive as a growth stock is that it has consistently increased EPS over the last four years. The company is projected to continue doing so this year, delivering a 17% sales growth in 2024. Expanding into new markets like Meta (NASDAQ:META), YouTube and TikTok will probably weigh on its current earnings but is expected to enhance future growth.\n\nThis may explain why analysts are so positive about DV stock. The average price target is currently at $29.12 per share. This represents a potential upside of over 45%, which typically spans for a 1-year period.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is an internet communications platform company. It is most known for its shared-screen meetings, which were prevalent during the pandemic. As the end of lockdowns brought a major decline in demand, Zoom now integrates AI into its software. ZM provides a one-stop business solutions platform for arranging communications as companies navigate hybrid work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is trading near pre-pandemic levels after its stock grew approximately ten-fold during the height of the pandemic. This means that ZM stock price is around 90% below its all-time record high. However, the company has since integrated AI and evolved into a tech company trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.3x for a tech. This is well below the S&P 500 average of 29.3.\n\nAnalysts expect continued growth, making Zoom one of the stocks to buy with an average price target signaling over 30% upside. Notably, Zoom has beaten consensus EPS consistently over the prior several earnings reports, with surprises ranging in double-digit territory.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is known for its AutoCAD software, which serves as the backbone of engineering and architectural development.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as the leader in 3D AI evolution through the use of generative AI to produce functional 3D shapes. In addition to AutoCAD, Autodesk offers other products like Fusion 360 and Maya that serve the construction, manufacturing and media industries.\n\nWhile it applies AI to many industries, the company has not seen significant investor interest as its share price is up less than 5% for the year. However, Autodesk is particularly compelling because of its very low expenses due to a subscription-based business model. This results in a gross profit margin of 92%, with the largest cost being sales and marketing to acquire new customers.\n\nAutodesk expects 10% revenue growth in 2024 through consistent growth that is not reliant on short-term AI trends. Also, analysts are optimistic about the ADSK stock, with 19 out of 23 recommending buying Autodesk shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the stock market, the allure of AI stocks extends far beyond blue chips. While giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominate headlines, the street increasingly turns towards hidden gems within the AI sector. Here, the focus is on three lesser-known companies capitalizing on trends in industries with AI tech. These hidden AI stocks represent more than just a tech trend. By harnessing AI\u2019s capabilities, these companies enhance operational efficiencies and pioneer new standards of innovation and scalability.\n\nFor instance, the first one leverages AI in national security and digital identity. Meanwhile, the second one pioneers autonomous cybersecurity solutions. Similarly, the third one expands educational access through AI-driven platforms, catering to a growing demand for personalized learning solutions. Indeed, the fundamental strengths of each company highlight its strategic positioning and growth prospects. The potential for massive returns intrigued by the future of AI makes these stocks solid investment opportunities.\n\nBigBear.ai (BBAI) BigBear.ai (BBAI) is a leading provider of high-speed decision-making technologies. They specialize in AI-driven analytics and solutions for critical missions\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nBigBear.ai (NYSE:BBAI) specializes in AI solutions for national security and digital identity sectors.\u00a0The company has affirmed a top-line guidance for 2024 of $195 million to $215 million.\u00a0This\u00a0reflects the company\u2019s fundamental edge in integrating and leveraging acquisitions like Pangiam. Hence, these moves expand BigBear.ai\u2019s market reach and offerings. Indeed, the acquisition of Pangiam strategically intensified BigBear.ai\u2019s capabilities. These include computer vision, facial recognition, and biometrics, vital in digital identity sectors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, despite a decline in Q1 2024\u2019s top-line\u00a0to $33.1 million (from $42.2 million in Q1 2023), the company maintains a solid backlog and wins new contracts. The decline emerged from specific factors like program wind-downs and revenue eliminations from bankruptcies. BigBear.ai generated a solid boost in cash balance, reaching $81.4 million as of March 31, 2024, up from $32.6 million at the end of 2023. This growth primarily stems from proceeds from warrants exercised and cash acquired from the Pangiam acquisition, bolstering the company\u2019s financial standing and liquidity.\n\nOverall, BigBear.ai\u2019s acquisition strategy and focus on integrating AI make it a top lead among hidden AI stocks.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) leads in autonomous cybersecurity powered by AI. The company has seen a significant 40% annual revenue growth to $186 million in Q1 fiscal 2025. This growth is complemented by an impressive gross margin of 79%. The margin returned to a record high. The company\u2019s consistent margin expansion, with 11 consecutive quarters of over 25 points of operating margin improvement, signifies its effective cost management and scalability.\u00a0Achieving positive free cash flow for the first time\u00a0(18% margin in Q1) points to SentinelOne\u2019s ability to derive cash while maintaining growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, SentinelOne\u2019s leadership in autonomous cybersecurity is evident through its AI-driven security platform and innovations like Purple AI. The company\u2019s strong customer growth metrics underscore its market acceptance and value proposition.\u00a0Customers with annual recurring revenue (ARR) over $100,000 grew\u00a0by 30% year-over-year, with record numbers exceeding $1 million ARR. This growth is fueled by expanding platform capabilities that drive higher ARR per customer and healthy customer expansion rates. The focus on large enterprises and the success of emerging solutions like Singularity Data Lake are driving triple-digit long-term growth.\n\nTo sum up, SentinelOne\u2019s constant top-line growth,\u00a0strong\u00a0customer metrics, and operational efficiency solidify its mark among hidden AI stocks.\n\nNerdy (NRDY)\n\nHands using laptop with mathematical formulas. Online education concept\n\nNerdy (NYSE:NRDY) provides AI-powered educational platforms through its Varsity Tutors brand. The company reported an active membership of 46,100 as of Q1 2024, a significant 40% annual increase. This growth exceeded their guidance target of 45,500 members. The growth in active members is crucial, as it indicates expanding adoption and utilization of their learning memberships.\u00a0This\u00a0contributes significantly to revenue stability and growth. Nerdy attained quarterly institutional revenue of $11.9 million in Q1, reflecting a solid 39% annual increase. Institutional revenue constituted 22% of the company\u2019s top-line, demonstrating sharp diversification beyond consumer subscriptions.\n\nAdditionally, in Q1 2024, Nerdy expanded access to its Varsity Tutors platform to 1.2 million students, bringing the total to\u00a02.2 million students across over 475 school districts. This rapid scalability underscores Nerdy\u2019s ability to penetrate new markets efficiently, leveraging institutional partnerships to achieve widespread adoption. Providing vibrant academic resources at no cost forms the plinth for upselling and expanding service offerings.\n\nTo conclude, Nerdy\u2019s position among the top hidden AI stocks is due to its use of AI for personalized learning in the booming edu-tech sector.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held a long position in NVDA.

After all, stellar gains in U.S. Big Tech, led by AI chipmaker Nvidia, have skewed the overall performance picture for the S&P500 and much rides on their results.\n\nThe S&P is up +17% this year, but an equivalent equal-weight index (EWGSPC) is up just +3.8%.\n\nNo doubt, market breadth is a factor in Europe too.\n\nThe top 10 STOXX components make up 25% of the index, versus around 20% five years ago, LSEG data shows But the STOXX's outperformance, up +7.8% YTD, versus its equal-weighted equivalent, up +3.8%, is narrower than its U.S. peer\n\nStory continues\n\nEurope's equity market may be smaller than the U.S., but the love is spread more widely.\n\n(3) On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) keeps its policy rate steady.\n\nThe ECB is all but certain to keep rates steady on Thursday, a month after its first rate cut in five years.\n\nAttention is on whether policymakers say more about further rate cuts.\n\nEurozone inflation eased for the first time in three months in June, but rose in the dominant services sector, where it has not dropped this year.\n\nSome policymakers felt uneasy about June's rate cut, regretting committing weeks in advance.\n\nSo officials are in no hurry to flag what's next, and will scrutinize data out before the September meeting.\n\nNo doubt, ECB President Christine Lagarde will be quizzed about whether the bank is ready to step in and buy French and other government bonds in the event of further turmoil.\n\nThat looks unlikely unless there are much bigger market swings, or serious contagion to other countries' debt.\n\n(4) In the U.K., the King\u2019s speech announces the full Labour legislative agenda.\n\nKing Charles will announce the full legislative agenda of the new government of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at 1200 GMT on Wednesday.\n\nBut investors are likely to be watching more keenly for inflation data out earlier that day.\n\nHeadline inflation eased back to the Bank of England's 2% target in May but policymakers are watching services prices most closely \u2014 they've been rising nearly 6% in annual terms.\n\nBoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said he was unlikely to be swayed by one set of data, puncturing bets in financial markets on a rate cut as soon as the BoE's next scheduled monetary policy announcement on Aug. 1st.\n\nThe latest U.K. jobs data on Thursday will also be key for the BoE, which is worried about the strong pace of wage growth.\n\n(5) On Monday, China\u2019s 3rd plenum, an event held every five years, kicks off.\n\nChina's third plenum, a seminal event typically held every five years and originally expected late last year, kicks off on Monday.\n\nReforms top the agenda: they could include the most significant overhaul of the fiscal system in three decades to try to redirect income from Beijing to cash-strapped regional governments.\n\nA parade of top-tier Chinese data releases meanwhile spans GDP, retail sales and industrial output.\n\nWhile strong exports provided respite in the first half, sluggish domestic demand and a shrinking property sector could prove challenging for the rest of the year.\n\nDeflation is a worry, and central bank efforts to support long-term bond yields could also hamper growth.\n\nStill, investors are hopeful that new stimulus can lift market sentiment. Chinese blue chips (CSI300) have edged higher, after notching up seven straight weeks of losses.\n\nZacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks\n\n(1) Vertex Pharma: This is a $492 stock with a market cap of $127B.

        "title": "Stay Far Away From Qualcomm Stock\u2026 Until It Hits $150",
        "content": "The expectations are sky-high for\u00a0Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and other artificial intelligence hardware manufacturers in 2024. Since the prevailing sentiment surrounding Qualcomm is highly optimistic, contrarian investors shouldn\u2019t be too eager to buy\u00a0Qualcomm stock\u00a0now.\n\nInvestorsPlace contributor Chris MacDonald reported on the analyst community\u2019s highly ambitious projections for Qualcomm. At the same time, the CEO\u2019s share sale seems to tell a different tale. In addition, a well-known tech-gadget manufacturer\u2019s addition of AI features could put a dent in Qualcomm\u2019s future top-line results.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s Apple Problem\n\nAs InvestorPlace contributor Larry Ramer explained, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is preparing to roll out Apple Intelligence, which includes AI features for some of the company\u2019s products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOwners of the \u201ciPhone 15 Pro\u00a0and\u00a015 Pro Max, as well as iPads and\u00a0Macs with M1 or newer chips\u201d can look forward to AI-powered features as soon as this fall.\n\nApple\u2019s loyal customers could quickly get used to these AI features. Consequently, Apple\u2019s market share for smartphones and other tech gadgets might grow this year and next year.\n\nThat\u2019s potentially bad news for Qualcomm, which reportedly derives \u201cmost\u201d of its revenue from Android devices. Ramer observed that Qualcomm \u201cbenefited last quarter from strong sales of AI-capable Android devices.\u201d\n\nSo, investors should be concerned about Apple taking market share from Android devices and thereby diverting an important revenue source from Qualcomm.\n\nChipmaker Chiefs Are Selling Their Shares\n\nA recent report from Barron\u2019s found a pattern that should make overeager Qualcomm investors think twice. In particular, multiple chipmaker chief executives have sold large numbers of their company\u2019s shares.\n\nThe report identified four CEOs and the quantities of their companies\u2019 shares that they sold:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang sold 720,000 shares. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) CEO Sanjay Mehrotra\u00a0sold 457,280 shares. Coherent (NYSE:COHR) CEO Vincent \u201cChuck\u201d D. Mattera Jr. sold 15,000 shares and \u201cexpects to\u00a0sell up to 65,000 Coherent shares, and use stock options to acquire and sell up to another 128,620 shares through the end of 2024.\u201d Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon sold 40,500 shares.\n\nDo these chief executives know something that most retail stock traders don\u2019t? Do they expect imminent share-price drawdowns?\n\nThese are valid questions in light of the CEO\u2019s share sales \u2013 and in light of Qualcomm\u2019s elevated valuation. Qualcomm has a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of\u00a0around 6x, and that\u2019s quite high. In fact, it\u2019s double the sector median P/S ratio of around 3x.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm Stock: Only Buy It at This Price\n\nWith at least four chipmaker chiefs selling shares of their companies, this isn\u2019t just a fluke. It\u2019s a pattern that should raise eyebrows and raise concerns among Qualcomm\u2019s loyal shareholders.\n\nPlus, the introduction of Apple Intelligence could negatively impact Qualcomm\u2019s top-line stats in the upcoming quarters. Hence, since Qualcomm\u2019s valuation is elevated, stock traders should wait for lower price points.\n\nPreviously, I recommended only buying\u00a0Qualcomm stock at $150 or less. I won\u2019t win any popularity contests for this, but I\u2019m sticking to my $150 buy-price suggestion. You\u2019ll thank me when the Qualcomm share price gets there, as the buying opportunity will be hard to resist at that point.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "The global cryptocurrency market is worth $2.4 trillion. Top performers Bitcoin and Ethereum have delivered gains of 100% and 68% over the last 12 months, as easing inflation has brought less stable investments back into fashion. However, cryptocurrencies remain a riskier play than most stocks, as they are known for their volatility and prices that can rise and fall on the whim of something as simple as a social media post.\n\nCrypto's decentralized nature makes it easy to use, enabling worldwide transactions with minimal fees. However, it can also mean that without tangible ties to an organization, there can be very little rhyme or reason for price fluctuation.\n\nAs a result, investors looking to grow their portfolio with less risk might want to consider tech stocks. Tech is an ever-expanding market that benefits from consistent demand for upgraded software and hardware products. Consequently, investing in companies with solid business models and market penetration can deliver major growth over the long term.\n\nSo, here are two tech stocks with more potential than any cryptocurrency.\n\n1. Intel\n\nYou might be surprised to see Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) on this list, with its stock down 39% since 2021. The company doesn't exactly have a reputation for outperforming cryptocurrencies. However, Intel is turning things around and is active in industries that could help it see its stock price soar in the coming years.\n\nIntel shares jumped 13% in the last month as investors appear to be taking notice of recent restructuring. In 2023, the company announced a \"fundamental change\" in its operations that would see it expand full force into the foundry market by building chip fabs across North America.\n\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the semiconductor foundry market was estimated at $107 billion in 2022 and is projected to more than double to $232 billion by 2032. Chip demand skyrocketed in recent years as advances in various tech sectors require more powerful hardware to take their designs to the next level.\n\nSince the start of 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a critical growth driver for chip sales, with graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to develop the generative software. As a result, Intel has set its sights on becoming a leading AI chip fabricator, allowing it to profit from increased demand across the industry. Considering chip giants like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices outsource much of their manufacturing, Intel is positioning itself to be the go-to U.S. chip fabricator.\n\nThe AI market is expanding at a compound annual growth rate of about 37%, on its way to hitting nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030. Chip demand is only likely to keep rising in that time, suggesting Intel is nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\n\nStory continues INTC PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, two key metrics indicate Intel is trading at a value, which could also attract new investors. The company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio are below their 12-month averages. The company is investing heavily in some of the world's most lucrative industries, which could allow its stock to outperform the crypto market over the next decade.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's stock has grown faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum for at least five years. Meanwhile, the company's potent position in tech suggests it will likely keep beating the crypto market long into the future. NVDA Chart\n\nPrior to 2023, Nvidia was most known for its dominant position in gaming. The chipmaker is responsible for 88% of the discrete desktop GPU market, which has grown from 65% over the last 10 years. The company's chips have become the preferred option for gamers worldwide, who use the GPUs to build high-powered gaming computers.\n\nNvidia's success in the market allowed it to branch out to multiple other tech areas, from handheld game consoles to laptops, cloud platforms, and, most crucially, AI. The tech giant has reinvented itself as one of the biggest threats in artificial intelligence, as its AI GPUs have become the gold standard. Nvidia now boasts a lucrative list of prominent clientele, with Microsoft, ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and Alphabet's Google Cloud all using its chips.\n\nNvidia's success in AI has seen its quarterly revenue and operating income soar by 93% and 149% over the last year. Meanwhile, its free cash flow climbed 281% to $39 billion. Comparatively, Nvidia's rival AMD's free cash flow hit just over $1 billion this year. So, in addition to its dominant market share, Nvidia is more financially equipped to keep investing in its technology and extend its lead in AI.\n\nNvidia's massive growth potential means that even with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 47, its stock is a buy and a better option than any cryptocurrency.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Dumping It and Piling Into These 3 Surprising Value Stocks Instead",
        "content": "For three decades, investors have been patiently waiting for the next great innovation to come along that would rival what the internet did for corporate America. The arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) might be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nArtificial intelligence allows software and systems to oversee tasks that humans would normally undertake. The key to AI's seemingly limitless potential is that software and systems have the capacity to learn without human intervention. This gives the technology utility in pretty much every facet of the U.S. and global economy.\n\nThough growth estimates are all over the map, the most eye-popping forecast comes from the analysts at PwC, who believe AI can add an estimated $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. With dollar figures this immense, it's not a surprise that Wall Street's smartest and richest money managers have been piling into AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut what might come as a shock is that leading AI company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has gained nearly $3 trillion in market value since the start of 2023, has been a top sell candidate for more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers.\n\nNvidia has been shown the door by a number of Wall Street's prominent billionaire investors\n\nThanks to quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, everyday investors have the ability to track what Wall Street's top money managers are buying and selling. The March-ended quarter saw eight billionaires -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- dump shares of Nvidia stock. However, the three most-prominent billionaire sellers were (total shares sold in parenthesis have been adjusted for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (29,370,600 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (24,627,160 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (7,200,040 shares)\n\nWhile profit-taking is a viable reason that could explain why prominent billionaire asset managers sent Nvidia to the chopping block during the first quarter, there are a few other headwinds that may have encouraged this exodus.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia will almost certainly face increasing competition in the coming quarters. Advanced Micro Devices is ramping up production of its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) for high-compute data centers, and Intel is launching its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerating chip during the current quarter.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's four largest customers, which account for approximately 40% of its net sales, are developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. The problem for Nvidia is that, even if maintains its compute advantages and develops next-generation AI-GPU architecture that outpaces its rivals, the mere presence of other chips reduces data center space for Nvidia's hardware. It also limits the AI-GPU scarcity that's driven its pricing power into the heavens.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the most damning factor of all might just be that no buzzworthy innovation, technology, or trend over the last 30 years has escaped an early stage bubble. History shows that investors always overestimate the uptake and utility of new technologies, which makes it likely that AI will follow suit. If the AI bubble were to burst, Nvidia's stock would likely be hit hard.\n\nBut while these top billionaire investors were busy sending shares of Nvidia to the chopping block, they were piling into three surprising value stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPhilippe Laffont: PayPal Holdings (8,014,159 shares purchased)\n\nNvidia's biggest billionaire seller undeniably had eyes for the leading financial technology (fintech) stock during the first quarter. Coatue Management's 13F notes that the fund picked up more than 8 million shares of PayPal Holdings(NASDAQ: PYPL), which as of March 31 were worth almost $539 million.\n\nAlthough competition is increasing among digital payment and peer-to-peer payment providers, most of PayPal's important user metrics signal continued growth. Payment transactions grew by 11% in the March quarter to 6.5 billion, while total payment volume has sustained a double-digit growth rate, sans currency movement.\n\nFurthermore, the company's active accounts are more engaged than ever. Though active account growth has stalled in recent quarters, the average payments completed by active accounts over the trailing-12-month period has increased from 40.9 at the end of 2020 to 60 on the nose, as of the end of March 2024. Since this is primarily a usage-driven platform, higher engagement is a recipe for an increase in gross profit.\n\nWith Wall Street's consensus calling for nearly 16% annualized earnings growth through 2028, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 13 makes PayPal stock quite the deal.\n\nKen Griffin: Bank of America (22,434,948 shares purchased)\n\nThe world's most-profitable hedge fund since inception, which is overseen by billionaire Ken Griffin, opted to trade out shares of Nvidia for time-tested financial institution Bank of America(NYSE: BAC).\n\nAmong America's largest banks by assets, Bank of America is the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve's most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s might not have been well received by borrowers, but it's been a godsend for lenders like BofA. The longer the nation's central bank stands pat on interest rates, the more net-interest income BofA and its peers can collect.\n\nBank of America also deserves plenty of credit for its technological prowess. While it might not be the first company you think of when it comes fintech innovation, BofA's digitization efforts are paying off. A whopping 76% of consumer households were banking online or via mobile app in the first quarter, and exactly half of all loan sales were completed digitally. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions and will, over time, improve Bank of America's operating efficiency.\n\nA forward P/E ratio of a little over 11 suggests that Bank of America stock is still a bargain for investors.\n\nIsrael Englander: Merck (4,021,500 shares purchased)\n\nAlthough billionaire Israel Englander is known for his love of fast-paced tech stocks, it's pharmaceutical company Merck(NYSE: MRK) that proved to be the apple of his and his investment team's eye during the March-ended quarter.\n\nIf there's a primary lure to owning Merck stock, it's Keytruda, the company's world-leading cancer immunotherapy. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics, phenomenal pricing power, increased use in existing indications, and label expansion opportunities have put Keytruda on pace for nearly $28 billion in annual run-rate revenue. With constant-currency sales growth of 24% in the March quarter, there's no reason to believe Keytruda's growth will slow anytime soon.\n\nAn unsung hero for Merck that doesn't get anywhere near enough attention is its Animal Health segment, which accounts for almost 10% of the company's net sales. Between keeping livestock healthy and the willingness of pet owners to spend a small fortune on the well-being of their furry, feathered, gilled, and scaled family members, Merck's pet division provides a steady growth foundation.\n\nWith sustained double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth expected, Merck's forward P/E of 13 continues to look like a value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "According to a report by the Financial Times on Tuesday, one of the most successful tech investors said Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could be worth almost $50 trillion in a decade.\n\nThe number represents more than the combined current market value of the entire S&P 500.\n\nHowever, the publication reported James Anderson, well-known for his early bets on companies such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as saying that \"the potential scale of Nvidia in the most optimistic outcome is both way higher than I've ever seen before and could lead to a market cap of double-digit trillions.\"\n\n\"This isn't a prediction but a possibility if artificial intelligence works for customers and Nvidia's lead is intact,\" he reportedly added.\n\nNvidia has been a primary beneficiary of the surge in chip demand following the emergence of generative AI. Its shares have surged over 175% in the last 12 months, pushing its market capitalization above the $3 trillion mark.\n\nAnderson, who recently teamed up with the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family to launch Lingotto Investment Management, said Nvidia's \"persistent exponential progress, the competitive advantages in hardware and software, and the culture and leadership are exactly what we look for.\"\n\nWhen assessing the difference between Nvidia and some of his previous successful tech bets Anderson notes: \"Amazon, Tesla etc didn't start from highly profitable and dominant positions but had to get there\".\n\nHe explained that the real growth in data center AI chip demand looked to be running at about 60% per year. When assessing the next decade, he stated that 10 years of 60% growth in data center revenue alone, with unchanged margins, would result in earnings of $1,350 per share and free cash flow of approximately $1,000 a share.\n\nThe FT said Anderson remarked that an Nvidia share might be worth $20,000 in 10 years, translating to a market capitalization of $49 trillion. Anderson assigned the probability of this type of outcome at 10% to 15%.\n\nHe added: \"It is the long duration of the development of GPU usage in AI \u2014 and not just AI \u2014 from excitement, through potential pauses, to transformation of industries that is most important to us.\"\r\n\r\nAnderson believes the route to the extremely lofty valuation will likely be volatile, and it would not be surprising if the chipmaker had one or more significant drawdowns.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCan Nvidia really hit $50 trillion market cap like this tech investor suggests?\n\nThese stocks are benefiting from what could be a larger market rotation\n\nProgressive shares up 2% as Q2 earnings exceed estimates\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Reflecting On Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\u2019 Q1 Earnings: Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)\n\nWrapping up Q1 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the processors and graphics chips stocks, including Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) and its peers.\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported an ok Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.6%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 4.7% below consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, but processors and graphics chips stocks have performed well, with the share prices up 13.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM)\n\nThe result of a spinoff from Sanken in Japan, Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) is a designer of power management chips and distance sensors used in electric vehicles and data centers.\n\nAllegro MicroSystems reported revenues of $240.6 million, down 10.7% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 2.4%. Despite the top-line beat, it was a weaker quarter overall for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\n\u201cContinued strong momentum in e-Mobility drove record fiscal year 2024 sales to more than $1 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.35. We also achieved a record level of design wins of more than $1 billion. I would like to thank the entire Allegro team for their contributions which enabled us to achieve these significant milestones,\u201d said Vineet Nargolwala, President and CEO of Allegro.

        "title": "Better AI Chip Stock: Broadcom vs. Marvell Technology",
        "content": "Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Marvell Technology(NASDAQ: MRVL) usually don't attract as much attention as higher-growth chipmakers like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nBut like Nvidia, both diversified chip specialists are benefiting from the rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Let's examine the AI-driven tailwinds for both companies and see which stock is a better chipmaking play right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe differences between Broadcom and Marvell\n\nBroadcom has expanded and transformed over the past eight years. The Singapore-based chipmaker Avago bought the original Broadcom in 2016, inherited its brand, and relocated its headquarters to the U.S. in 2018. The \"new\" Broadcom subsequently expanded into the infrastructure software market by acquiring CA Technologies,\u00a0cloud software giant VMware,\u00a0and Symantec's enterprise security division.\n\nIn its latest quarter, Broadcom generated 58% of its revenue from its semiconductor business, which sells a wide range of wireless, optical, and data storage chips. The remaining 42% of its revenue came from its infrastructure software. Broadcom notably relied on Apple for 20% of its sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 (which ended last October), but its acquisition of VMware -- which closed last November -- should reduce that percentage in fiscal 2024.\n\nMarvell is best known for its data processing units (DPUs), which bundle together CPUs, networking interfaces, and programmable data acceleration engines. It also sells infrastructure, Wi-Fi, and custom chips -- as well as networking and storage devices -- for the cloud, 5G, automotive, enterprise networking, and AI markets. Marvell similarly expanded inorganically over the past decade, but it didn't acquire any big software companies.\n\nIn its latest quarter, Marvell generated 70% of its revenuefrom the data center market, while the rest was split between its other end markets. A single unnamed customer (most likely Western Digital or Seagate) accounted for 24% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended this February).\n\nWhy Broadcom and Marvell are both AI plays\n\nBroadcom and Marvell are both experiencing strong sales of optical and networking chips for data centers. These chips don't process AI tasks on their own, but they're essential for ferrying massive amounts of data. So as data centers upgrade their servers with Nvidia's GPUs, they need to buy more of Broadcom's and Marvell's chips.\n\nBroadcom expects to generate at least $11 billion in AI chip revenue in fiscal 2024, which would be equivalent to more than 21% of its projected full-year revenue. Marvell garnered more than 10% of its revenue from AI chips in fiscal 2024, and it expects that percentage to rise in fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nNeither of these chipmakers is a direct play on the AI market like Nvidia, which generated 87% of its revenue from the data center market in its latest quarter. Instead, they both serve a more balanced blend of non-AI and AI-driven markets.\n\nWhich of these chipmakers is growing faster?\n\nBroadcom's revenue growth will be inflated by its acquisition of VMware this year, but analysts expect it to continue expanding after it laps that purchase. Marvell made a few acquisitions in fiscal 2023, but its revenue fell 7% in fiscal 2024 as macro headwinds throttled the growth of its carrier, enterprise networking, consumer, auto, and industrial markets. Analysts see that slowdown persisting through fiscal 2025 until the macro environment presumably improves in fiscal 2026.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue Growth Current Fiscal Year Estimated Revenue Growth Next Fiscal Year EV/Revenue Ratio (Next FY) Broadcom 44% 16% 17 Marvell (2%) 33% 12\n\nData source: Marketscreener. FY = fiscal year.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Marvell looks a bit cheaper than Broadcom relative to its enterprise value (EV). But if we look at their projected gains in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), Broadcom looks like the better value.\n\nCompany Estimated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Current Fiscal Year Estimated Adjusted EBITDA Growth Next Fiscal Year EV/EBITDA Ratio (Next FY) Broadcom 34% 22% 27 Marvell (9%) 58% 38\n\nData source: Marketscreener. FY = fiscal year.\n\nFurthermore, Broadcom is consistently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, while Marvell isn't. Marvell racked up GAAP losses over the past four fiscal years as it expanded, and analysts don't expect it to turn profitable again until fiscal 2026 -- but that's assuming it doesn't make any more massive acquisitions.\n\nThe better AI chip buy: Broadcom\n\nOver the past 12 months, Broadcom's stock rallied 93% as Marvell's stock rose 16%. Investors were clearly more impressed by Broadcom's bold expansion of its software business, its increasing exposure to the AI market, and its stable GAAP profits. I believe those strengths will keep it ahead of Marvell -- which has less exposure to the AI market, less predictable growth rates, and steeper losses -- for the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Is Overvalued Amid AI Exuberance",
        "content": "Toward the end of 2022 and throughout 2023, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) was trading at exceptionally attractive valuations. However, now the GF Value chart is showing the stock to be significantly overvalued.\n\nDuring my time writing and utilizing GuruFocus' proprietary tools, I have come to trust the GF Value chart immensely. From my further research and analysis on Taiwan Semiconductor, there are significant drivers of sales and profitability expansion to come, and mitigation from geopolitical risks through global diversification of manufacturing. However, I believe the company's valuation multiples compared to history show reason to be cautious, especially when observing the potential overvaluation in other artificial intelligence-related companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) at this time.\n\nOperational developments\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\nThe company is actively expanding its operations outside of Taiwan by building three fabrication facilities in Arizona over the next five years. Management said it is also building two plants in Japan over the next three years and has announced plans to jointly invest in European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in Germany, with production targeted to begin by the end of 2027.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor continues to lead in advanced chip manufacturing and is developing a new chip-manufacturing technology called A16, which is expected to enter production in the second half of 2026. Management has also announced it is going to charge customers extra for manufacturing outside of Taiwan, as there are increased costs associated with new manufacturing sites like Arizona.\n\nStarting this year, the company increased prices for its advanced process manufacturing by 3% to 6%. Major clients like Nvidia, Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have shown a willingness to accept the price increases. This has led to many analysts raising price targets for the stock, with the company's long-term growth prospects being reinforced by the fact its higher pricing is likely to allow it to further develop its research and development and strengthen its moat.\n\nIn my opinion, these developments certainly add to the security of investing in Taiwan Semiconductor. However, one has to remember that the company's target market is already mature. Therefore, while AI markets are developing and HPC chips are likely to become more in demand as digitalization scales globally, Taiwan Semiconductor is unable to deliver the high growth that is more likely to occur in newer AI and semiconductor intellectual property companies. In addition, regulatory inhibitions surrounding AI and automation could inhibit growth in these sectors, which are predicted to be highly accretive to the company. That being said, Taiwan Semiconductor expects its AI-related revenue to double in 2024 and grow at a 50% compound annual rate over the next five years. It also expects AI-related revenue to potentially reach over 20% of its total revenue by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs CEO C.C. Wei said, \"Almost all the AI innovators are collaborating with TSMC to address the insatiable demand for energy-efficient computing power.\"\n\nFinancial and valuation analysis\n\nInvestors are anticipating future results with the current stock price growth the market has delivered, as the last year has actually seen both a revenue and net income contraction for Taiwan Semiconductor. In the first quarter, the company's revenue grew 16.50% year over year and its net income grew 8.90%. Taiwan Semiconductor Is Overvalued Amid AI Exuberance\n\nNotably, Taiwan Semiconductor holds over 60% of the global semiconductor foundry market, which is significantly ahead of its closest competitor, Samsung (SSNGY), which holds around 14%. Therefore, competition is much less of a problem than for most major tech businesses as the company's moat in manufacturing advanced semiconductors is unmatched anywhere in the world. In my opinion, this is likely to allow the company to continue to scale its profitability margins over the long term. These are already incredibly high, with a net margin of 38.75% at the time of writing compared to 7.37% for Samsung, but notably lower than Nvidia's net margin of 53.40%, which has recently overtaken Taiwan Semiconductor on the metric. Taiwan Semiconductor Is Overvalued Amid AI Exuberance\n\nGiven its exceptional moat, a reasonable revenue CAGR for Taiwan Semiconductor is forecasted by leading analysts to be around 16% for the next five years. The earnings per share CAGR by analysts is expected to be around 24% over the next five years, which is indicative of the margin expansion opportunity I have outlined above. However, over the past five years, revenue has only grown at a CAGR of around 19% and earnings without non-recurring items at around 24% per annum. Therefore, a significant expansion in valuation multiples is unwarranted, in my opinion. Arguably, a slight expansion would be fair due to the potential for future exponential fundamental growth as a result of the company's continued support for AI systems, but this year, its valuation multiples have risen disproportionately to these near- and medium-term expected gains. Taiwan Semiconductor Is Overvalued Amid AI Exuberance\n\nThe chart above illustrates the concern I have that is preventing me from investing in the company at this time. It is further supported when we view the multiple expansion in tandem with future estimates, as depicted in the GF Value chart: Taiwan Semiconductor Is Overvalued Amid AI Exuberance\n\nIn my opinion, despite the strengths that management has been able to deliver in driving revenue growth and profitability margin increases recently, as well as future strategy positives such as a direction toward AI, the stock is still too richly priced at present levels. In my opinion, investors would be wise to avoid allocating capital until the valuation has become more reasonable.\n\nA price-sales ratio of around 7 would be more reasonable at this time, which would allow some expansion against the 10-year median of 6 but not inflated to levels that have obviously become unrealistic. The current price-sales ratio is around 11. Based on this analysis, I think it is highly likely the stock will experience short-term to medium-term volatility, especially as 2026 nears, which is when analysts are expecting the company's fundamental growth to ease somewhat following the current high-growth period of the cycle.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nI have noticed in my previous research on Taiwan Semiconductor that geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan are a significant threat. However, this is being eased by management's focus on international fabrication facilities. In addition, I believe it is quite likely that Donald Trump will be elected in November to the White House, and I have a favorable opinion that he will be diplomatic and appeasing to Chinese interests. However, if Biden is elected, there is likely to be growing tension in international relations, in my opinion, as a result of the Democratic Party supporting NATO expansion, which is causing tension with Russia, China and Iran. The international expansion strategy by Taiwan Semiconductor to mitigate the geopolitical risk is shrewd, but it will be difficult for the company to replicate the Taiwan-based model in other markets, including due to cultural differences and increased production costs.\n\nTSMC is also facing weakness in traditional markets like smartphones and PCs, although its AI-related demand is growing rapidly. This further reinforces my previous point that many of TSMC's core markets are already saturated, and its heavy reliance on AI markets moving forward opens up risks with regulatory inhibitions. In addition to these growth concerns, the company operates in a highly cyclical industry that is dependent on the demands of various technology companies. This ecosystem is largely prone to recessionary pressures as many of the advanced technologies are seen as luxuries rather than necessities. Furthermore, high capital intensity should be understood to also influence cyclicality for TSMC, with periods of large build-outs and development reducing margins temporarily and periods of production that are highly margin expansive due to the moats it develops in manufacturing capability.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my opinion, Taiwan Semiconductor is positioning itself operationally to be one of the most enduring and powerful companies in the world over the next few decades. In the meantime, however, I believe it is incredibly important that investors take note of the valuation. Because the market understands the long-term value here, there are likely to be periods of irrational exuberance fueled by trends and heightened anticipation around sector growth in AI, robotics and automation. In my opinion, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is overvalued right now and investors who allocated years ago or during 2022-23 would be wise to hold, but buying at the present valuation multiples seems likely to bring short-term to medium-term downside.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold for 50 Years",
        "content": "Predicting the future is a fool\u2019s errand. If you had asked me just five years ago what 2024 would look like, I would have gotten it laughably wrong. The world has changed at a dizzying pace over the last two decades, with the rise of smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence, and so much more. Paradigm-shifting events like the COVID-19 pandemic have humbled our collective prognosticating abilities.\n\nSo, looking out 50 years to 2074 seems downright quixotic. Will we have flying cars and robot butlers as 1950s futurists imagined? Probably not. But I believe we can still make some informed, if speculative, bets on which industries and companies could deliver hypergrowth if things break their way. Artificial intelligence, genomic medicine, and clean energy look poised to revolutionize the economy and our lives in the coming decades.\n\nOf course, any 50-year prediction will likely prove off the mark. But, I\u2019m willing to take some risks on high-upside growth stories. Because if the stars do align, the rewards could be astronomical. With that in mind, here are seven hypergrowth stocks to buy and hold until 2074:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) is well-positioned to ride the megatrend of urban air mobility in the coming decades.\n\nIt recently completed a 523-mile flight with its hydrogen-electric aircraft. The company also continues to make steady progress on the regulatory front, becoming the first eVTOL maker to have its final airworthiness criteria published by the FAA.\n\nFinancially, Joby remains on solid footing with $924 million in cash and short-term investments as of Q1 2024. This cash should provide ample runway as the company ramps up manufacturing and prepares for commercial operations targeted for 2025. Joby Aviation cash\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts are generally bullish on JOBY stock. The consensus rating is a \u201cmoderate buy\u201d with a 12-month average price target of $9, implying nearly 45% upside from current levels. Raymond James recently initiated coverage with an \u201coutperform\u201d rating, while Canaccord Genuity reiterated its \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nSure, Joby is still in the pre-revenue stage and faces risks as it navigates uncharted skies. However, with strong partnerships like Toyota (NYSE:TM), Delta (NYSE:DAL), and the U.S. Air Force, I believe Joby has the right ingredients for long-term success. As the $1 trillion urban air mobility market takes flight in the coming years, Joby looks poised to be a prime beneficiary.\n\nStory continues\n\nCredo Technology (CRDO) Temperature-Taking Technology Isn't Even the Best Reason to Buy Remark Stock\n\nCredo Technology (NASDAQ:CRDO) is riding high on the AI and data center megatrends. I believe the company\u2019s focus on high-speed connectivity solutions positions it well to capitalize on the explosive growth in data and AI infrastructure.\n\nIn Q4 2024, Credo\u2019s revenue surged an impressive 89.4% year-over-year to $60.8 million, driven by strong demand from hyperscale customers deploying AI. Analysts are bullish, with a consensus \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target of $29, although insiders have been selling shares recently. Credo\u2019s management expects AI-related revenue to double by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nWith gross margins over 65% and a cash-rich balance sheet, I think Credo has the financial strength to keep investing in innovation. As long as the data boom persists, I believe Credo\u2019s growth story has legs. The stock has been volatile but rewarded investors with a 5% return over the past month. Of course, competition from giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a risk to watch. I\u2019m optimistic about Credo\u2019s prospects if the coming decades are driven by data.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a leading provider of team collaboration and productivity software. I believe the company is well-positioned to benefit from several megatrends that should act as tailwinds for growth in the coming years. The rise of AI is a key one \u2013 Atlassian is already using AI to boost team productivity through features like predictive smart search and AI-powered writing assistance. The ongoing migration to the cloud is another massive opportunity, with Atlassian now a \u201ccloud-majority\u201d company with over 300,000 cloud customers.\n\nEnterprise service management is yet another area in which Atlassian has strong momentum. Its Jira Service Management product hit $600 million in annual revenue as large organizations increasingly standardize on Atlassian. Financially, the most recent quarter impressed, with $1.19 billion in revenue (up 30% YOY), 82% gross margins, and positive operating income. Atlassian also provided bullish medium-term guidance, targeting 20%+ revenue CAGR through FY27 while maintaining operating margins above 25%. The growth ahead is too good to ignore. Hypergrowth stocks: Atlassian estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock has pulled back significantly from its highs and is basically flat in the past year, but I suspect it may have bottomed out here. I see significant upside if the growth continues.\n\nDroneShield (DRSHF) A drone being used by soldiers.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nDroneShield (OTCMKTS:DRSHF) provides drone detection and countermeasure solutions to militaries and other security-focused organizations worldwide. I believe the company is poised for significant growth as the proliferation of drones in warfare and other domains is driving exponential demand for effective counter-drone technologies.\n\nDroneShield\u2019s financial performance has been nothing short of impressive. In Q1 FY2024, the company reported a staggering 900% year-over-year increase in revenues, reaching 16.4 million AUD. This growth was fueled by major contract wins, including a 5.7 million AUD repeat order from a U.S. government customer and a landmark counter-drone procurement agreement with NATO.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on DroneShield\u2019s prospects. Bell Potter rates the stock a buy with a forecast of 97 million AUD in sales and 24.4 million AUD in earnings for FY2024. CEO Oleg Vornik\u2019s recent comments suggest even greater ambitions, hinting at the potential for annual revenues to reach 500 million AUD.\n\nI believe DroneShield is well-positioned to capitalize on these megatrends and deliver substantial returns for investors. While the stock has already seen impressive gains (up 767.65% in the past year), I think there\u2019s still plenty of room for growth.\n\nSamsara (IOT) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSamsara (NYSE:IOT) provides software and insights for physical operations through its Connected Operations Cloud. The company is riding several megatrends that I believe position it well for continued hypergrowth. First, the increasing digitization of physical operations across industries like transportation and manufacturing is driving strong demand for Samsara\u2019s platform. Second, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) could accelerate in the coming years as interest rates come down.\n\nSamsara delivered 37% revenue growth to $281 million in Q1 while also achieving record gross margins of 77%. Large enterprise customers grew 43% as Samsara became a strategic partner for digitizing complex operations. Analysts remain bullish, with RBC Capital reiterating an Outperform rating and $47 price target. The stock has surged 23% in the past month alone.\n\nWhile Samsara\u2019s platform extends well beyond EVs, I\u2019m optimistic the company will benefit as high-growth tech stocks roar back. With a massive $20 billion market cap already, Samsara still has a long runway ahead in my view. The company\u2019s ability to deliver fast ROI and billions in customer savings makes it a compelling investment for the years and even decades to come. Of course, competition is fierce, and execution is key, but I believe the stars are aligning for Samsara.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) is a leading content delivery network and cloud security company that helps power and protect a huge portion of the internet. I\u2019d bet that most of the websites I visit on a daily basis rely on Cloudflare\u2019s services in some way, even if it\u2019s not obvious. This company has quietly become the backbone of the modern web.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Cloudflare posted strong results, with revenue growing 30% year-over-year to $378.6 million. Large customer growth was particularly impressive, as Cloudflare added a record number of customers spending over $100,000, $500,000, and $1 million annually. Operating margins also expanded.\n\nCloudflare is riding several powerful tailwinds that should continue propelling its growth. The ongoing shift to the cloud, the rise of edge computing, and the ever-increasing importance of cybersecurity are all megatrends playing right into Cloudflare\u2019s strengths. As more companies digitize their operations and more data moves online, the demand for Cloudflare\u2019s web performance and security solutions will only increase.\n\nCEO Matthew Prince recently unloaded over $12.9 million worth of stock. However, this is likely for personal financial reasons and doesn\u2019t change the company\u2019s fundamental story. With Cloudflare powering 80.6% of websites in some form, its market dominance is unquestionable. As long as the internet keeps growing, Cloudflare should keep winning.\n\nSemrush Holdings (SEMR) A concept image of a person holding a phone with various icons representing software-as-a-service companies. SaaS stocks.\n\nSource: TierneyMJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush Holdings (NYSE:SEMR) provides an online visibility management SaaS platform used by marketers for SEO, PPC, content, social media, and competitive research. I believe Semrush is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of the digital marketing software market, which is expected to reach $264 billion by 2030. As businesses increasingly rely on search engine traffic to drive revenue, tools like Semrush that optimize online visibility are becoming mission-critical.\n\nSemrush delivered impressive results in Q1 2024, with revenue up 21% year-over-year to $85.8 million. The company is firing on all cylinders \u2013 paying customers increased to nearly 112,000, while its free active user base surpassed 1 million for the first time. Importantly, Semrush achieved strong profitability, reporting income from operations of $1.5 million and generating a free cash flow of $12 million.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019m very bullish on Semrush\u2019s growth prospects. The company is making smart investments in AI-powered tools like Content Shake and expanding upmarket with its new enterprise SEO product. This should drive further ARPU expansion, as enterprise contracts carry 10-15x higher values than Semrush\u2019s current average. With secular tailwinds at its back and a large market opportunity ahead, analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the stock, with a consensus price target of $15.90 implying nearly 18% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Utility Stocks That Are Hotter AI Investments Than Nvidia",
        "content": "Being an investor with some experience in spotting trends, I have been observing the AI hype train and it is impossible not to notice the acceleration of Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, having become a major constituent of the S&P 500 index. Nevertheless, in this case, it seems that everyone is rushing to the next big thing, which is an AI chip maker, but I think that there are some diamonds among AI utility stocks which are far more attractive from the investment perspective.\n\nAI utility stocks are the companies that are in the conventional utility business supplying fundamental commodities such as electricity, water and natural gas but have also made significant investments in AI and machine learning (ML) to reinvent themselves.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of these picks since they combine the low beta and high income of the utility sector together with the growth tailwind of the ever-growing rise of AI to boost profits and efficiency, and I think we\u2019ve only started to tap into this trend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are three AI utility stocks for investors to consider this month.\n\nXcel Energy (XEL) The exterior of the Xcel Energy (XEL) headquarters in Minneaopolis, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nXcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) provides electricity and natural gas services to customers across eight states in the U.S.\n\nI am quite amazed with how Xcel Energy has been implementing the use of AI and digital transformation in the company. This approach is quite aggressive, since to solve the problem, the company chose one of the most complicated and regulated spheres \u2013 nuclear power. First, Xcel applied AI and automation to the improvement of its nuclear safety, thus mobilizing $15 million of annualized savings that could be used to support the achievement of the company\u2019s carbon neutrality vision.\n\nCrucially, they have also been able to reinvest over 70,000 hours of manual work to the business which would otherwise have been expended on non-core activities.\n\nThis investment in AI has added to the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock. It has been on a rocket ship for the past ten years, more than doubling in value. This makes XEL one of those AI utility stocks to consider, especially since it can be scooped up at a bargain as it trades at 16x times earnings, near a historical low.\n\nPG&E (PCG) the PG&E logo on the front of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPG&E (NYSE:PCG) is integrating AI to enhance its grid management and wildfire prevention efforts.\n\nPCG has a number of things going for it. The consensus on the stock from Wall Street analysts is that it\u2019s a buy, and there are also accretive revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates given for the stock. However, the company\u2019s focus on AI and advanced camera systems is also part of my buy recommendation on the stock. Using a growing number of high-definition cameras and testing the AI-based smoke detection features, the company is proving its readiness to use the most advanced tools to prevent wildfires and deal with them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe initial outcomes of PG&E\u2019s AI pilot projects are rather positive. It is already able to identify smoke and the possibilities of a fire outbreak one or two minutes before normal human eyes can, thus giving the company\u2019s Wildfire Safety Operations Center ample time to come to the rescue. This could be a revolution in the making, especially given that the wildfire season in California continues to be more and more unpredictable and disastrous.\n\nPCG making inroads into AI early could be very accretive for the company, as it uses it for disaster mitigation strategies that may lower maintenance costs over time, thus allowing for more cash flow to be returned to investors.\n\nSempra Energy (SRE) The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nSempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is a company that is loved by Wall Street analysts. It carries a strong buy rating.\n\nAlso, the strategic collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was one of the reasons I have a buy recommendation on Sempra Energy\u2019s stock in the past through a memorandum of understanding.\r\n\r\nThe MOU spelled out strategies for artificial intelligence for clean energy objectives, hydrogen and renewable natural gas, and microgrid and grid improvement strategies.\n\nThere are a few reasons I like SRE more than NVDA stock, namely because it trades at a far lower valuation than the chip maker\u2019s 74x times earnings. Comparatively, SRE trades at just 17x, and has a far less volatile growth trajectory due to being in utilities. Holding SRE for the long run then could give investors more certainty in the possible distribution of returns, while NVDA\u2019s volatility may give investors a wild ride.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors are increasingly drawn to hot AI stocks amid rapid industry innovation and market growth. The overall AI space is predicted to soar from a $196.6 billion market in 2023 to more than $1.8 trillion by 2030. Accordingly, investors looking to capitalize on the growth of AI are increasingly looking at a wide range of sectors such as automotive, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. Identifying undervalued AI stocks early is key to maximizing investment potential.\n\nAI has rapidly emerged as a leading industry, which is poised for substantial long-term growth. With numerous companies integrating AI, now is an opportune moment to invest in promising AI stocks. However, selecting top contenders is challenging due to the industry\u2019s infancy and evolving landscape. Thus, investors navigating AI stocks must carefully identify future industry leaders.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Symbotic (SYM) Short-Squeeze Stocks\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) excels in warehouse robotics and AI, achieving robust Q2 2024 sales of $424 million. Importantly, Symbotic\u2019s revenue growth rate has remained in the high doubled digits, supposed by recent deployments of three new systems and upgrades for existing operational ones. These moves have enhanced the company\u2019s capacity and efficiency with advanced algorithms and AI chips. This positions Symbotic as a breakout stock, driven by rapid growth and technological innovation in logistics automation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as its major customer, Symbotic has a relatively stable long-term growth trajectory. Currently, Walmart drives about 90% of its $1.339 billion revenue last year. While there is some risk with customer concentration that should be considered, it\u2019s clear Symbotic\u2019s core technology is in high demand. Notably, Symbotic also recently launched Greenbox, a service module, through a $7.5 billion joint venture with SoftBank. Future launches should further bolster the company\u2019s growth prospects moving forward.\n\nSymbotic is positioned to lead in blue-collar industries amid the AI wave, targeting a vast market. In Q2, the company enhanced efficiency with new routing algorithms and AI chips, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations significantly. Growth catalysts include a new solutions and a logistics service deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, suggesting strong future growth potential.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a top semiconductor maker demanding a very high multiple in the world of chip makers. In fact, on a trailing basis, AMD\u2019s price earnings multiple is higher than that of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a shocking concept for many investors looking exposure to AI-related chip makers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome analysts have cited limited AI growth potential for AMD, preferring its competitors. However, the company\u2019s new Ryzen\u2122 processors with Neural Processing Units target AI applications, alongside projections to secure a $15 billion share in the data center GPU market, support buy ratings form analysts at Citi (NYSE:C) that have issued a buy rating and a $176 price target on AMD stock.\n\nIn current news, AMD announced it has acquired Silo AI, Europe\u2019s largest private AI lab, for about $665 million in cash. This move strengthens AMD\u2019s AI strategy with Silo AI\u2019s renowned team of scientists and engineers specializing in custom AI models and solutions across cloud, embedded, and endpoint computing. Silo AI CEO Peter Sarlin will lead the team under AMD\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Group, aiming to enhance AI solutions on AMD platforms. The acquisition is set to finalize in the latter half of 2024, supporting AMD\u2019s goal to rapidly deploy advanced AI solutions worldwide.\n\nAMD\u2019s stock surged 153% from early 2023, driven by aggressive AI initiatives in response to Nvidia\u2019s industry dominance. AMD has launched a number of competitive chips, securing mega-cap tech clients along the way. Shifting to annual chip releases, AMD unveiled the MI325X following the MI300X AI accelerator. Although there are bigger competitors like Nvidia who holds almost 95% of the market, AMD still holds strong growth potential in the world of AI.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nJoining recently the trillion-dollar club, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) shows resilience and underscores the impact of AI in the chip sector. The company has now surpassed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the seventh most valuable tech company. Other major tech giants have also hit record highs, with rankings continuing to fluctuate, which will remain the case moving forward.\n\nCFRA analyst Angelo Zino highlighted that the semiconductor sector became the top industry in the S&P 500 in recent remarks, reflecting significant global shifts over the past 15 to 18 months. This surge, driven by soaring demand for chips amid the growth of generative AI, suggests ongoing industry expansion.\n\nTSM saw Q1 gross margin rise to 53.1%, boosted by favorable product mix changes. Operating margin improved to 42%, driven by stringent expense controls. The company\u2019s Q1 EPS hit TWD8.7 with a solid 25.4% return on equity, reflecting strong profitability. TSMC plans $28-32 billion in 2024 CapEx, focusing on advanced technologies and global expansion with new fabs in Arizona, Japan, and Europe, to meet rising AI market demands efficiently.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Investors have been on a roller coaster since the start of 2024, with considerable market fluctuation. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 experienced plenty of peaks and valleys due to factors like the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market, a potential decrease in interest rates, and easing inflation. ^IXIC Chart\n\nThe most recent dip occurred on July 11 when a U.S. inflation report revealed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased 0.1% the month before, the index's first negative reading since May 2020. Meanwhile, the CPI saw a 3% year-over-year rise in June, decelerating from May's 12-month increase of 3.3%.\n\nMarkets opened higher on the encouraging news, while tech stocks began to tumble later in the day. Investors who sought haven in tried-and-true stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft seemed to reshuffle their holdings to include companies that could also benefit from easing inflation.\n\nThe dip in tech stocks could signal a buying opportunity, with many of these companies still likely to see significant gains over the long term. So, here are two growth stocks that are screaming buys in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia: Growth catalysts that will keep it expanding for decades\n\nNvidia's stock has climbed 157% since the start of 2024, which has made it the first chipmaker to cross a market cap of $3 trillion. Yet, its dominant role in tech suggests it still has plenty of room left to run.\n\nSince the start of last year, Nvidia emerged as one of the biggest threats in AI, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the most sought-after chips by developers worldwide. Increased demand for AI services has caused Nvidia's earnings to soar as the market has required a seemingly endless supply of GPUs.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia's revenue rose 262% year over year in its latest quarter (first quarter of fiscal 2025), while operating income soared 690%. The company profited from impressive gains in its AI-focused data center segment.\n\nWhile AI remains a lucrative growth catalyst for Nvidia, with the sector projected to hit nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030, the company achieved solid positions in other tech areas that could also boost its business in the long term.\n\nFor instance, the company achieved an 88% market share in discrete desktop GPUs, a market where it sells its chips to consumers who use them to build high-powered gaming PCs or setups for video editing. Sales of these chips are classed under Nvidia's gaming segment, which rose 18% in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, ended April 28, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe quarter also highlighted the company's budding automotive business, where Nvidia supplies its hardware to companies like Tesla, powering self-driving technology. Automotive revenue jumped 11% to $329 million in Q1 2025. However, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress sees automotive as a potential multibillion-dollar business as the market develops and expects it to be the \"largest enterprise vertical\" with its data center segment in 2024. NVDA Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nNvidia's shares are trading at about 47 times its forward earnings, which doesn't exactly scream \"bargain.\" However, its head start in AI has seen its financials rise so far above its competitors that Nvidia is unlikely to lose its market dominance anytime soon. As a result, this growth stock will likely continue delivering gains for years, making it a screaming buy in 2024.\n\n2. Amazon: A better value than you might think\n\nWhile Nvidia enjoys hype around its chips, there's been similar excitement over Amazon's position in AI software. The company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holds a leading 31% market share in the cloud industry, potentially giving it an edge in AI.\n\nCloud services have become the go-to for many businesses seeking ways to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, AWS and rivals like Microsoft's Azure invested heavily in their respective platforms, introducing new AI tools over the last year.\n\nHowever, Amazon's lead in the industry has allowed it to more easily promote its products to its prominent clientele, which includes Netflix, Formula 1, Meta Platforms, and Samsung.\n\nAs a result, bullish investors boosted Amazon's stock by 53% since last July. While that kind of rally could sink the value of a company's shares, Amazon is actually more of a bargain than you might think. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nAmazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is significantly lower than the same metric for its biggest competitor, Microsoft. Additionally, Amazon's P/S is reasonably close to the average it has maintained over the last decade, while Microsoft's is nearly double. The P/S ratio is a useful valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its trailing 12-month revenue. In other words, the metric highlights the cost of a single share in relation to how much that share generates in revenue. As a result, the lower the P/S, the more value a stock offers.\n\nSo, in this case, Amazon's P/S indicates that its stock is trading at a bargain compared to its No. 1 rival, Microsoft, making it a no-brainer investment this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 High-Priced Stocks Ripe for a Split and Surge",
        "content": "Stock splits are all the rage this year. In the last month alone, there\u2019s been a 10-for-1 stock split by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and a 50-for-1 split by Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), one of the biggest events in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its stock 3-for-1. And chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) executed a 1o-for-1 split on July 15.\n\nWhile it is true that stock splits don\u2019t change the underlying fundamentals or valuation of a stock, they do make the shares more affordable, especially to retail investors. Broadcom\u2019s stock traded on July 12 at $1,700 a share. Now it\u2019s priced at $170. The lower price helps to explain why most stocks get a boost immediately after their shares split. Companies realize this, which is why they continue to split their stocks.\n\nHere are three high-priced stocks ripe for a split and surge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) announced a 10-for-1 stock split on July 11. Sure enough, the company\u2019s share price surged, up 7% on the news. The company, which is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in the world, said the shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis August 8. The split comes as MicroStrategy\u2019s stock has risen more than 230% over the last 12 months to trade at $1,500 per share.\n\nOnce completed, the split will lower MicroStrategy\u2019s share price to about $150 a share based on the current price. While technically a provider of enterprise software, MicroStrategy has switched its focus in recent years and adopted an aggressive Bitcoin-buying strategy. At the end of June this year, MicroStrategy owned 226,331 Bitcoin worth $13.30 billion based on the current price of the largest cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nAnalysts at Bernstein recently wrote in a note to clients that MicroStrategy is \u201cbuilding the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin company\u201d and that the stock has an additional 80% upside.\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (FICO) a pile of credit cards, credit card interest rates\n\nSource: Teerasak Ladnongkhun/Shutterstock.com\n\nFair Isaac Corp. (NYSE:FICO), the credit scoring agency behind everyone\u2019s FICO score, looks like a good candidate for a stock split with its share price currently at $1,550 and trading near a 52-week high. The company\u2019s share price has nearly doubled in the last year, including a 37% year-to-date gain. At more than $1,500 each, the shares are out of reach for many retail investors who might like to get their hands on them.\n\nFair Isaac has previously split its stock on four occasions. However, the last split occurred 20 years ago. Given the length of time since the last split, now would seem like a good time for Fair Isaac to make its stock more accessible to individual investors. The company\u2019s share price has marched steadily higher on the back of strong financial results. Fair Isaac enjoys a near-monopoly over credit scoring in the U.S. These facts have made Fair Isaac one of the best-performing stocks of the last 10 years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVR (NVR) The logo for NVR is seen on the top of an office building.\n\nSource: DCStockPhotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a company that has never split its stock, though it probably should. Home builder and mortgage bank NVR (NYSE:NVR) has been publicly traded since 1993, yet never split its stock. The result is that the company\u2019s shares now trade at $8,000 each, putting them far out of reach for most investors. A split of the company\u2019s stock would be a massive undertaking at this point, but would likely give the share price a boost.\n\nInterestingly, NVR stock has continued to rise despite the sticker shock involved with its share price. Over the last 12 months, the stock has gained nearly 30%, including a 15% gain this year. And the stock is currently trading at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 16 times future earnings estimates. The stock\u2019s valuation is not out of whack despite the $8,000 price tag.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that NVR is one of the few stocks that Warren Buffett bought over the last year. Buffett, of course, is famous for having never split the Class A shares of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) holding company. Those Class A shares of Berkshire now trade at an astounding $639,000 each.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in NVDA and FICO.

        "title": "7 Terrible Tech Stocks to Avoid at All Costs",
        "content": "This year will surely go down in the history books as the year of tech stocks, thanks to advances like generative artificial intelligence that are pushing the market to new highs. But for all the amazing tech stocks available today, there are also some truly terrible tech stocks that investors should avoid.\n\nThe names on this list are disappointing, and investing in such struggling tech stocks would be a huge mistake. Some of them are good companies that are just losing to better competition, and others are saddled with products that don\u2019t resonate in today\u2019s market.\n\nI\u2019m using the Portfolio Grader to identify some of the worst tech stocks today based on factors such as earnings performance, growth (or lack thereof), and analyst ratings. We\u2019re also considering market momentum, which can sometimes be an overlooked factor when evaluating stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks with weak momentum tend to be viewed negatively by the market, as the poor sentiment makes it harder for them to attract capital or generate investor enthusiasm. Momentum problems can lead to a cycle of poor performance, trapping the company and its investors into a money-losing proposition.\n\nInvestors would do well to identify tech stocks to avoid and instead put their hard-earned money into equities with a better chance of outperforming indexes like the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile many other tech stocks with an emphasis on AI are taking off this year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nShares are down significantly this year, and I think it\u2019s fair to question whether Intel is in jeopardy of losing its coveted spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nGranted, Intel is showing signs of life with a modest rally this month. However, Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein speculates that\u2019s more from short covering rather than increased confidence in Intel\u2019s prospects.\n\nIntel is at a tremendous disadvantage in the AI race. It rolled out its Gaudi 3 Accelerator chip hoping to compete with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its H100 chip, but Nvidia has already moved on to the Blackwell platform and will surely retain its superiority over Intel.\n\nIntel is also trying to get into the foundry business to make semiconductors for other companies, but Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) has the lion\u2019s share of that business locked up.\n\nINTC stock is down 33% this year and gets a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a cloud computing company that provides cloud-based data storage and analytics, operating under a \u201cdata-as-a-service\u201d model.\n\nThe company\u2019s AI Data Cloud allows its customers to share data, build applications and improve their businesses with AI.\n\nShares are down, however, in part because of data breach \u2014 which is a serious issue for any company like Snowflake that processes to be an expert in working in cloud environments.\n\nThe issues involves from Snowflake allowing customers to set up accounts using single-factor authentication instead of the more secure multifactor authentication protocol.\n\nSo, despite Snowflake increasing its revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 by 34% to $789.6 million, investors are souring on SNOW stock.\n\nSnowflake stock is down 30% in 2024 and gets a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) the solar edge logo on an iPhone. SEDG stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG), as you can probably deduce from the name, operates in the solar energy space. The company makes power optimizers and inverters that help solar panels operate more efficiently.\n\nBut the solar industry has been tough for the last couple of years. Higher labor costs, inflated interest rates, and regulatory changes have weighed on the industry. Potential customers aren\u2019t willing to borrow money to install solar panels while interest rates remain high, and the Fed has so far resisted a rate cut even though inflation has slowed.\n\nIn June, the stock took another tumble when SolarEdge disclosed that one of its customers. PM&M Electric, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection The company owes SolarEdge $11.4 million, and there\u2019s no guarantee that SolarEdge will ever see that money now.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter showed revenue of $204.4 million, down a whopping 78% from a year ago. The company posted a loss of $26.1 million for the quarter, versus a profit of $300 million in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nSEDG stock is down 68% in 2024 and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nUiPath (PATH) Mobile phone with web page of software development company UiPath Inc. on display in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of cellphone screen. Unmodified photo. PATH stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) makes robotic process automation software, which allows customers to automate repetitive tasks \u2014 ideally improving productivity.\n\nAnd like many other companies, it\u2019s rolling out generative AI-powered features to make its products easier to use. UiPath\u2019s AI products help developers build products, write code, perform quality checks and provide real-time insights.\n\nThe company reported solid earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 \u2014 revenue of $335.11 million and adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents beat analysts\u2019 estimates on the top and bottom lines.\n\nBut even with that report, PATH stock fell because the company announced the CEO Rob Enslin was stepping down, and was replaced by the company\u2019s former CEO, Daniel Dines. Shares fell 30% on the news.\n\nFor the year, PATH stock has been down 50% and has gotten a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStem (STEM) A concept image of a person's hands holding a plant with floating glowing particles around it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) is a California company using AI to provide clean energy solutions and services. Its platform is designed to help customers manage scaled energy assets and portfolios more efficiently. The company works with solar, storage, and electric vehicle charging companies.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $25.5 million, down from $67.4 million in the same quarter a year ago. The company incurred a $33 million noncash adjustment due to adjusted estimates of contract guarantees issued in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBookings dropped significantly, from $363.5 million a year ago to $23.8 million in the first quarter. Stem attributed the drop to a shift in strategy to pursue large, utility-scale projects. But notably, the company lowered its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $567 million to $667 million in revenue from a range of $600 million to $700 million.\n\nSTEM stock is down 67% in 2024 and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInteractive Strength (TRNR) View from behind of woman working out to a televised exercise program.\n\nSource: MIA Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInteractive Strength (NASDAQ:TRNR) is a struggling tech stock that recently executed a reverse 1-for-40 reverse stock split to keep the stock price over $1 per share and avoid delisting.\n\nBut investors always see through high-jinks like that, and TRNR stock is already back to 70 cents per share even following the reverse split.\n\nInteractive Strength is a Texas-based tech company that provides fitness equipment and virtual training. It has three platforms: Climbr, which includes vertical climbing machines for full-body workouts; Forme, an interactive home gym, and Forme Golf, which is a golf training platform.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $363,000, up from $157,000 a year ago. But the company posted a loss of $11.3 million for the quarter.\n\nTRNR stock is likely to continue to drop. The stock is down 97% this year and gets a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nProfessional Diversity Network (IPDN) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks to sell\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nProfessional Diversity Network (NASDAQ:IPDN) is the smallest company on the list, with a market cap of just over $5 million. It serves as a job board and resource for companies seeking to diversify their workforces, including employees who are disabled, veterans, LGBTQA+, or people of color.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion practices has been a hot topic for many corporations, and some states are beginning to ban DEI initiatives. The Supreme Court also issued a ruling earlier this year that raised new questions about if DEI practices will be considered legal.\n\nAmid that backdrop, an investment in IPDN appears to be a risky bet.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $1.72 million, down 12% from a year ago. The company posted a net loss for the quarter of $803,000 and 7 cents per share.\n\nIPDN stock is down 76% this year and gets a \u201cD\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position in NVDA.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had a LONG position in NVDA.

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Micro-Sized Mavericks With Mega-Sized Potential",
        "content": "The tech run that we have been experiencing came under some pressure on Thursday with FAANG stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others pulling back as traders rotated out of large caps and into small-cap stocks, as reported by Investopedia. The article went on to say that this rotation was mainly because of the expectations that the Federal Reserve will move to reduce the interest rates this year and this would definitely be beneficial for micro-cap stocks, as it may improve their risk profiles.\n\nOver the past couple of years, thanks to a boom in AI spending and investment, micro-cap stocks have left somewhat out of the picture, with indices like the Russell 2000 index gaining only 38.79% over the past five years to the Nasdaq\u2019s 125.85%. Broadly, I believe that these micro-cap stocks could be seen as undervalued on a systematic basis, which gives them huge potential for investors.\n\nSo here are three micro-cap stocks for investors to consider buying amid these market developments and projections.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackSky Technology (BKSY) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nBlackSky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) is an interesting but quite a risky investment. Still, there is no gain without a proportionate amount of risk to take on, and BKSY is one of those hot, micro-cap stocks that could become a multibagger.\n\nThe thesis for BKSY hinges on the planned launch of next generation Gen-3 satellites, which could be a game changer given that the enhanced imaging could lead to new applications and acquisition of new clients.\n\nHowever, BKSY does have some weaknesses. Its\u00a0crucial problem is profitability \u2014 or the lack thereof. Although there is an increase in adjusted EBITDA, BlackSky remains to have significant GAAP losses and negative free cash flow because of the high operating costs and capital investments.\n\nStill, the satellite technology has a unique competitive advantage in that it allows customers to \u201ccapture and quickly deliver large volumes of dawn-to-dusk, time-diverse imagery [that] increases transparency into strategic defense and economic activities which could otherwise have gone unnoticed.\u201d\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock. micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nAs an investor, I must say that I am quite bullish on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). I do agree that the company has gone through some difficulties in the past but I think that the recent events have greatly improved the company\u2019s position.\n\nThe major development is that Plug Power has at last got a conditional $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy in May. This is a great endorsement to the company\u2019s technology and the future business expansion plans. Of course there are some steps that they have to overcome in order to get the actual money, but the fact that the Department of Energy is ready to invest such a large amount is already a big plus.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen analyzing the recent financials, there is still much to do and improve in terms of profitability. However, the company is clearly progressing \u2014 service and fueling margins are growing and the company has managed to control cash outlay quite effectively. With the new capital they can raise, I think they have a decent chance of reaching self-sustaining free cash flow in the next three to five years, which would be supported by a capital raise. This then makes it one of those micro-cap stocks with great potential.\n\nTurtle Beach (HEAR) micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am quite enthusiastic about the current happenings at Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR). This renowned gaming accessories firm has recently acquired something that I feel will allow it to expand and become profitable in the future.\n\nIn my opinion the $118 million deal to acquirePerformance Designed Products is a big deal. Performance Designed Products is a key rival particularly in the controller category, thus adding them to the company\u2019s product line and market presence enhances the company\u2019s standing.\n\nHowever, the complementarities expected from this deal are quite handsome as well. The company expects to achieve cost synergies of $11 million and there could be revenue synergies as well given their combined scale and distribution reach. This should help in increasing the profitability of the company greatly.\n\nAmid the announcement, HEAR has also courted the attention of some Wall Street analysts, despite having a market cap of just $300 million.

        "content": "Billion-dollar companies are some of the most valuable companies. They lead the stock market and have become an integral part of the economy. Once, such companies were a rarity, but today there are many. These billion-dollar stocks are vying for the trillion-dollar spot and as they chart the upward journey, it is time to give them a\u00a0spot\u00a0in your portfolio so that you can be a part of their success.\n\nThese are, of course, highly profitable businesses with an edge in the industry. They are known to offer the best products and services to meet the demands of users and they have a growth strategy that works in their favor. Here are seven billion-dollar stocks that deserve a place in your portfolio this year. Let\u2019s take a look at them in detail.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top pharmaceutical companies, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY)\u00a0has a market valuation of $893 billion, and it is one of the best stocks to own right now. The company is known for the weight loss drug Zepbound. As compared\u00a0to the other drugs, Zepbound leads to a faster weight loss which has taken the company\u2019s sales by storm. It generates the majority of revenue for Eli Lilly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, LLY is struggling to meet the demand for its weight loss. But the pharmaceutical company is not limited to just one drug.\u00a0Its Alzheimer\u2019s drug, Donanemab was\u00a0recently approved.\u00a0And it is also working on\u00a0other two\u00a0weight loss drugs, one being an oral pill.\n\nIt is buying Morphic Holding (NASDAQ:MORF) for $3.2 billion, the company develops treatments for chronic diseases, and the deal will help Eli Lilly expand into the gastroenterology medical segment. Undoubtedly, Eli Lilly is one of the best pharma stocks to own. Currently LLY stock is up 60% year-to-date, and is an ideal stock split candidate.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another billion-dollar stock with a significant upside potential. While AMD stock hasn\u2019t rallied as much as Nvidia, it is slowly but steadily making an upward stride. Trading at $181 today, the stock is up 31% YTD and looks undervalued to me.\u00a0There are multiple catalysts working\u00a0for the company.\n\nArtificial Intelligence will boost the company\u2019s revenue and as the business grows, its revenue will soar. In the first quarter, it saw the data center sales\u00a0grow\u00a080% YOY and it is expecting to achieve sales of $4 billion from the MI300 this year.\u00a0The company is expanding its reach by buying Silo AI, the largest private AI lab for $665 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the data center business\u00a0grows, AMD will see rapid growth but investors should not compare it to Nvidia. The company is charting its\u00a0own\u00a0path to success and might not be number one but\u00a0is\u00a0a compelling investment with a market cap of $294 billion. Wells Fargo has recently increased the price target of the stock to $205, an 11% upside.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) has become a hot stock this year. Up 84% YTD, it is exchanging hands for $187 right now and there\u2019s no stopping its upward momentum. Driven by AI frenzy, the stock has had one of its best years.\n\nThe company recently reported second-quarter revenue and easily beat market expectations. Its revenue\u00a0came in at\u00a0$20.67 billion, representing a 40% growth in the quarter. TSM is one of the best billion-dollar stocks to own.\n\nA supplier to industry stalwarts, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia, TSM has\u00a0managed to\u00a0offset the weak smartphone sales with a surge in AI chip sales. Buying the stock below $200 could be a smart move. This stock is going to hit new highs with the current AI hype.\n\nTo keep up with the rising demand, it has planned capital expenditure in the range of $28 billion to $32 billion this year and\u00a0it\u00a0will be focused on enhancing the technology capacities. It is also expanding in Japan and Europe to ensure effective demand responsiveness.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother tech company seeing massive highs is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). A legacy software company, Oracle has been around for a long time now and it understands how the market works. The company has benefited from the global transition towards cloud and its cloud infrastructure revenue has seen a massive upside.\n\nExchanging hands for $142, the stock is up 39% YTD and has been on an upward rally since May. Its fundamentals are impressive and the company enjoys a dividend yield of 1.12%, rewarding investors with passive income.\n\nKnown for offering the best AI data center infrastructure globally, Oracle saw a 44% jump in outstanding performance obligations in the recent quarter, including new AI deals of $12.5 billion.\n\nThe data center revenue jumped 42% YOY and the company is already building 100 new data centers to meet the global demand. It has partnered with some of the top tech giants and the soaring AI demand could boost its valuation. The stock will hit $200 this year.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a household name today with the company valued at $281 billion. While it is nowhere close to a trillion-dollar valuation, it is steadily moving higher and taking giant strides in the industry. Up 38% YTD, NFLX stock\u00a0is exchanging\u00a0hands for $647 and is a long-term buy and hold.\n\nIt is the largest player in the streaming space and has seen massive subscriber growth. It added 9.3 million subscribers in the first quarter to reach about 270 million. The company\u2019s investment in new content has made it a top choice for viewers. No other streaming giant comes close to its market share.\n\nNetflix is looking for different ways to attract users and drive growth and video games are one of them. It is growing the game library and has about 100 game titles with 32 experiences on the platform. They are free right now but the management could consider monetizing this segment very soon.\u00a0It is also expanding into sports and live entertainment.\n\nThe company is set to report results on July 18 and the stock is a buy before that.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintech giant Visa (NYSE:V) is one of the top billion-dollar stocks worth adding to your portfolio for the long-term. The company is valued at $525 billion and\u00a0the stock\u00a0has remained flat over the past six months. It is exchanging hands for $265 today and has been moving\u00a0in the range of\u00a0$258 to $290 since the beginning of the year. One solid reason to own the stock is its reliability and steady performance.\n\nVisa has a global presence\u00a0which\u00a0ensures it remains stable even in market ups and downs. The company generates a fee on every transaction processed through the Visa card and as we move towards cashless transactions, the demand for cards will grow and Visa will benefit. With more than 4 billion cards issued, the company is one of the top fintech players right now.\n\nDespite a high-interest environment and inflationary pressure, the company reported a 10% revenue jump and an 11% rise in processed transactions in the\u00a0first quarter. You may not see an immediate upside in the stock, but it is a highly dependable stock to own. Visa also enjoys a dividend yield of 0.79%.\n\nChevron (CVX) CVX stock\n\nSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you are a dividend investor, you\u00a0are going to\u00a0love Chevron (NYSE:CVX)\u00a0stock. The oil and gas giant had some of its best days in 2022 with oil prices soaring. While it is down from the highs it achieved then, CVX stock is up 4% YTD and exchanging hands for $155.\n\nThe company is valued at a market cap of $286 billion and while many believe that its best days are over due to the transition towards renewables, I tend to disagree.\n\nThe transition\u00a0is going to\u00a0take a few years and then too, the\u00a0demand for oil\u00a0will never drop to zero. Chevron has an upward and downward stream business that steadily generates cash flow. As the oil prices soar, Chevron benefits, and with oil trading close to $80 per barrel, it will continue to see revenue growth.\n\nThe company has also invested in the hydrogen sector and is trying to diversify its revenue streams. It is a cash flow machine with a dividend yield of 4.20% and a history of 37 years of hiking dividends.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While there are many ways to gain an advantage on Wall Street, betting alongside the biggest investors can potentially be quite lucrative. Naturally, the wealthiest institutions didn\u2019t earn that status by losing money all the time. So, it makes sense that to get the best results, you partner with the best. That\u2019s the mainline thesis behind institutional investor favorites.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the behemoths enjoy access to the best resources and tools available. Typically, retail investors lack the wherewithal for such privileges. In addition, the major institutions hire the brightest candidates. Therefore, you have a greater breadth of confidence when acquiring shares of institutional investor favorites.\n\nAt the same time, no guarantees exist. While the big boys may target the best ideas, they\u2019re not foolproof. Also, they can afford to be audacious with their wagers. However, you might not have the same luxury. Still, more often than not, the pros know what they\u2019re doing. On that note, below are intriguing institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nEasily one of the most popular ideas on Wall Street, it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the institutional investor favorites. Per data provided by HedgeFollow, AMZN stock represents the second-biggest institutional acquisition, behind only semiconductor juggernaut Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). As of filings in the first quarter of this year, institutional investors acquired $14.41 billion worth of shares.\n\nFundamentally, Amazon offers a multi-pronged weapon. Primarily, it dominates the e-commerce sector, an ecosystem that\u2019s been marching higher since the second quarter of 2022. In addition, Amazon dominates in technology services, particularly its AWS cloud network. Thanks to so many relevant businesses, the company posted an average earnings per share of 87 cents in the past four quarters. In contrast, analysts were anticipating only 63 cents.\n\nOne drawback with AMZN stock is that it trades at 3.58X trailing-year sales. Between the first quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the average metric sat at 2.63X. Still, what\u2019s intriguing here is that sales are projected to steadily expand. In fiscal 2024, the top line could move up 2.6% to $589.61 billion. By 2025, this figure could rise to $654.94 billion, up 11.1%.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to the topic of institutional investor favorites, we could discuss tech-related ideas to the end of time. However, it\u2019s important to note that the big dogs are also focused on other market segments. Interestingly, insurance and healthcare services provider UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ranks highly in terms of major market participants. Overall, Wall Street\u2019s best have acquired $6.14 billion worth of shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, institutional buyers may be thinking long term. Yes, UNH stock presents relevancies regarding medical insurance and other coverage-related concerns. Further, the company could see significant demand in the coming years for its over-age 65 plans. Thanks to the population spike of the post-war baby boom, millions of people will be retiring. Naturally, people of advanced age often require greater care needs.\n\nTemptingly, UNH stock is trading at a relative discount, with the market pricing it at 1.23X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric averaged 1.35X. What\u2019s more, covering experts believe that by year\u2019s end, revenue could rise to $398.43 billion. If so, that would imply a growth rate of 16.3%.\n\nIn the following year, sales could tick up again (by 7.5%) to $428.42 billion. It\u2019s one of the institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nHess (HES) Hess (HES) logo on a phone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those who wish to try their luck among the ideas endorsed by giants, energy player Hess (NYSE:HES) could be an interesting opportunity. Falling under the oil and gas exploration and production industry, Hess is also known as an upstream specialist. It also offers midstream (transportation) capabilities, covering crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. Thanks to geopolitical dynamics, HES stock may jump higher.\n\nEven better, the alpha dogs appear to be sniffing something special over the horizon. All told, the top investors have acquired $3.89 billion worth of HES stock. Cynically, should global oil supply chains be disrupted due to ongoing \u201ccurrent events,\u201d Hess could see a boost to the bottom line. Notably, it\u2019s already strong, with the company posting an average EPS of $1.77 in the past four quarters.\n\nAnalysts, it should be noted, expected only $1.18 during that time. Another compelling signal is that HES stock trades for only 3.98X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric reached 4.08X. So, even with the institutional interest, HES hasn\u2019t been priced at a premium.\n\nThat could change soon. Analysts are looking for fiscal 2024 revenue to hit $12.29 billion, up 15.5%. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the top institutional investor favorites to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Semiconductor Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Semiconductors have long been vital to our lives, powering not only our computers, but these days, our cars, smartphones, and even smart refrigerators and washing machines. Thus, it's not surprising that lots of semiconductor stocks have been phenomenal performers, making their shareholders wealthier.\n\nWith the recent proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, semiconductors have become even more vital. Here's a look at seven semiconductor companies that seem to have bright futures -- along with a different way to invest in semiconductors -- via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Note that they have different focuses and different valuations, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)has grown at a torrential rate in recent years, with many expecting it to keep doing so. (Others see it as needing to take a breather.) The company made a name for itself with gaming chips, but now it's not only a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) for games but also in chips for data centers. And data centers are booming, as much of our AI activity runs through them.\n\nThe stock's valuation is steep, but if it keeps growing like crazy, it can be warranted. Proceed with caution if you're risk-averse.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is the world's largest contract chipmaker, building chips designed by others. Recently valued near $1 trillion, its growth prospects are good, as it's a leader in its field, able to enjoy economies of scale. On the other hand, as it's based in Taiwan, it's vulnerable to China -- and the U.S. and others are working to develop more competition for the company.\n\n3. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is one of the most well-known chipmakers, recently carrying a market capitalization of $145 billion. Shares seem reasonably valued lately, after a sizable decline due to tough competition, heavy investments in future growth, and a loss of some market share. The company is aiming to grow in chips for laptops -- and is including a built-in AI processor in them.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has lots of fans because it specializes not only in chips but also software -- and its operations are very diversified, too, including wireless and wired technology, optical products, mainframe software, cybersecurity, and storage, among many others. Its customers include Apple, Microsoft, AT&T, Intel, and many other big names. Broadcom is executing a 10-for-1 stock split on July 12.\n\n5. Qualcomm\n\nQualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM) has been designing mobile chips for a long time -- and those chips have probably been in most of the iPhones you've owned. Apple is looking to make its own chips in the coming years, though, which may challenge Qualcomm. But it's been busy making chips for vehicles and smart appliances, among other things, diversifying its operations. Its foray into laptop chips is another promising move.\n\nStory continues\n\n6. Monolithic Power\n\nMonolithic Power(NASDAQ: MPWR) isn't as well known as some other semiconductor companies, nor is it as big, with a recent market value near $41 billion. But it's been growing like gangbusters, taking market share from rivals with its data-center chips.\n\nIts valuation seems steep, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 63, well above its five-year average of 43. So perhaps wait and hope for a pullback, buy in installments over time, or just jump in if you expect its amazing run to continue.\n\n7. Micron Technology\n\nMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is another semiconductor titan, valued near $145 billion recently, and specializing in memory and storage chips. Its believers like its solid balance sheet and its typical strong performance when the cyclical memory market is booming. Detractors are wary of downturns in the memory market and view it as overvalued, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15, above its five-year average of 12.\n\nBonus idea: Semiconductor ETFs\n\nThese companies are all intriguing, and many of them, but perhaps not all, will be outstanding performers in the years and decades ahead. (Much will also depend on the price at which you invest in them, if you do, so aim to buy when they appear undervalued or at least reasonably valued.)\n\nOne way to play it a bit safe -- while also aiming for outsized returns -- is to invest in semiconductors via ETFs that focus on them. Check out these that have solid track records:\n\niShares Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXX) VanEck Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SMH) SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF(NYSEMKT: XSD) Invesco Semiconductors ETF(NYSEMKT: PSI)\n\nConsider keeping some of your assets in semiconductors -- whether via individual stocks or ETFs.

        "title": "Nvidia and Broadcom Have Completed Their 10-for-1 Stock Splits, but Their Outlooks Differ Dramatically Over the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "It's a rare time to be an investor on Wall Street. While it's perfectly normal for a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend to be captivating investors' attention, having two trends vying for interest at the same time doesn't happen often.\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence (AI) is the core catalyst that's sent the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-focused Nasdaq Composite to record-closing highs in 2024, stock-split euphoria has played a key role, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company the opportunity to alter its share price and outstanding share count. What's noteworthy about splits is that they're entirely cosmetic, with a company's market cap and operating performance being unaffected.\n\nStock splits come in two varieties, forward and reverse, with investors undeniably favoring the former. With a forward-stock split, a company is purposely lowering its share price to make it more nominally affordable for retail investors and/or its employees. Comparatively, the goal of a reverse-stock split is to increase a publicly traded company's share price, often to ensure that it meets the minimum continued listing standards of a major stock exchange.\n\nThe reason investors favor forward splits is because they're undertaken by highly innovative companies that consistently out-execute their peers.\n\nSince 2024 began, around a dozen high-profile businesses have announced a stock split. However, none were more anticipated than that of AI titans Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nArtificial intelligence leaders Nvidia and Broadcom became Wall Street's newest stock-split stocks\n\nNvidia's board kicked things off on May 22, with the company announcing a 10-for-1 forward split, which became effective after the closing bell on June 7. This marked the sixth stock split for Nvidia since going public in January 1999.\n\nNot long after, on June 12, Broadcom's board made history by announcing its first-ever stock split, which coincidentally was also of the 10-for-1 variety. Broadcom's split went into effect after the close of trading on Friday, July 12, with shares trading at their split-adjusted price as of today, July 15.\n\nWhile there's natural excitement about a company's stock being more nominally affordable for everyday investors, artificial intelligence has been the driving force for both companies.\n\nNvidia's claim to fame is its first-mover advantages with AI-graphics processing units (GPUs). In 2023, 98% of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that were shipped came from Nvidia, according to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights. The company's H100 GPU has become the go-to chip desired by businesses wanting to train large language models and run generative AI solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, investors are excited about the future of Nvidia's AI-GPU architecture. The company's Blackwell platform, which offers accelerated computing improvements in a number of areas, including quantum computing and generative AI, is set to begin shipping to customers later this year. Meanwhile, in June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the release of the Rubin platform by 2026.\n\nAs for Broadcom, it's quickly become the premier name in AI-driven networking solutions. It capitalized on the artificial intelligence hype last year by introducing its Jericho3-AI fabric in April 2023, which is able to connect up to 32,000 GPUs in AI-accelerated data centers. Jericho3 is a solution that's designed to maximize the compute capacity of GPUs -- something necessary for the split-second decision-making required of AI software and systems -- as well as reduce tail latency.\n\nBroadcom has also been a popular partner for some of the largest and most-influential tech companies, including infrastructure giant Dell Technologies and Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBroadcom can run circles around Nvidia over the next five years\n\nBased on historical data from Bank of America Global Research that dates back to 1980, companies conducting forward-stock splits have averaged a 25.4% return in the 12 months following their announcement. This is more than double the average annual return of 11.9% for the benchmark S&P 500 over the comparable period. Statistically speaking, Nvidia and Broadcom would appear to be poised for more upside.\n\nBut dig beneath the surface and you'll find a number of clear-cut reasons why Broadcom has the tools and intangibles to handily outperform Nvidia's stock over the coming five years.\n\nIf there's a prevailing theme that makes Broadcom the far more-favorable stock to own in the coming years, it's history. Since the proliferation of the internet three decades ago, no next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend has avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. This is a roundabout way of saying that investors consistently overestimate the utility and/or adoption of new innovations and technologies, and artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception to this unwritten rule.\n\nThe entirety of Nvidia's nearly $3 trillion increase in market value since the start of 2023 has come on the heels of its AI-GPUs and CUDA platform, which is a toolkit that helps developers build large language models. If the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future, Nvidia's stock would probably be clobbered more than any other AI company.\n\nAlthough Broadcom has also enjoyed a sizable boost from AI, it's a considerably more-diversified company that would fare better if history were to rhyme. For example, Broadcom generates a notable percentage of its sales from wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. It also makes optical components used in industrial equipment, networking solutions for newer automobiles, and cybersecurity solutions, to name a small number of its other ventures and sales channels. Whereas the bursting of the AI bubble would be damning for Nvidia, it wouldn't be an end-all for Broadcom. AVGO Dividend Chart\n\nSomething else to consider is that Broadcom's rapidly growing dividend provides a safer foundation and, arguably, more mature investor base than Nvidia. Even with Nvidia recently increasing its quarterly payout by 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis, the company's token yield is only 0.03%.\n\nComparatively, Broadcom's quarterly payout has catapulted higher by 7,400% since late 2010. Whereas the company had previously been pacing a $0.28 base annual payout, Broadcom is now on track to dole out a cumulative $21/share annually to its investors. This is good enough for a 1.2% yield, and it demonstrates how consistent Broadcom's growth in operating cash flow has been since the end of the Great Recession.\n\nThe final reason Broadcom can handily outperform Nvidia in the return column over the next five years is their respective valuations. Nvidia's trailing-12-month (TTM) price to sales (P/S) ratio recently topped 40. This effectively matches the TTM P/S peaks witnessed prior to the dot-com bubble bursting from the likes of Amazon and Cisco Systems.\n\nAlthough Broadcom's TTM P/S ratio of 19 is considerably higher than its average of 5 to 7 times sales over much of the last decade, it'll have a much easier time growing into its current valuation than Nvidia.\n\nBetween Wall Street's two premier stock-split stocks, Broadcom looks to be a smarter long-term investment than Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview:  Focus shifts to Q2 earnings",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) surged on Friday, driven by gains in Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), as investors began to look beyond the technology sector's top performers. The Dow climbed 247.15 points, or 0.62%, to close at 40,000.90, hitting a new all-time high of 40,257.24 during the session.\n\nThe S&P 500 also rose, gaining 0.55% to close at 5,615.35, while the Nasdaq Composite increased by 0.63%, ending at 18,398.45.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 experienced its worst day since late April due to a significant market rotation away from Big Tech, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dropping 5.6%.\n\nDespite the sell-off in other major indices, the Dow managed to edge up by 0.08%. For the week, the Dow advanced 1.6%, boosted by a report on Thursday showing a 0.1% decline in the consumer price index (CPI) for June.\n\nThis week, the focus will shift to the earnings season, as economic data and central banker speeches will be relatively light. Nevertheless, market participants will keep an eye on economic reports for insights into the Federal Reserve\u2019s future policy decisions.\n\nThe standout event to watch is the June retail sales report on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe forecast control retail sales fell 0.3%M in June,\u201d Morgan Stanley economists said in a note.\n\n\u201cSofter payrolls, goods deflation, and a decline in auto sales, likely affected by the cyber attack, probably weigh on sales. Headline sales fall a greater 0.5%M. Our forecast is consistent with 2Q24 real consumption rising at a 1.4% annual rate.\u201d\n\nMoreover, June's Industrial Production and Existing Home Sales data are due on Wednesday.\n\nJ&J, Netflix and banks to report earnings this week\n\nNonetheless, much of the market\u2019s attention will be directed toward the Q2 earnings season, which kicked off last week.\n\nWall Street banks were the first to report. While JPMorgan and Citigroup are among the worst performers on the S&P 500 today, both banks posted Q2 earnings that exceeded expectations.\n\nCiti reported revenues of $20.13 billion, surpassing the forecast of $20.11 billion, and a net income of $3.03 billion, which was 11% higher than the estimated $2.72 billion. JPMorgan\u2019s results were even better.\n\nThis week, several companies are expected to be in the spotlight, most notably Johnson&Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), due to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Bank of America, ASML (AS:ASML), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) will also unveil their latest quarterly performance data.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nJPMorgan: \u201cThe historical spread between the performance of S&P500 and SPW is extreme. Given this, it is probable that the divergence peaks, but that could happen through winners stalling, and not through laggards rallying. Post the benign CPI print last week, SPW is bouncing again, but we fear the conditions for a sustained rally are not there, and look for the consolidation beneath the surface to continue through the summer.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nRBC: \u201cThe thing that we\u2019re most interested to get color on is whether earnings dynamics will give US equity investors a reason to continue the rotation that appeared to begin (yet again) last week away from Growth, Large, and Mega Cap, to Value, Small Cap, and everything else. As we discussed in Strategy Spotlight earlier this month, valuations and positioning have set the stage for an eventual rotation to new leadership. But this has been true for quite some time, and we\u2019ve had several false starts. Fundamentals need to cooperate. Greater confidence around Fed cuts coming soon clearly helps to make the case for moving back into Small Caps, and we confess that we exited last week more comfortable nibbling on Small Caps.\u201d\n\nEvercore ISI: \u201cThe U.S. economy slowed but recession was averted in 2012 and in 2015-6, and stocks became more volatile but quickly resumed their upward trajectories. In 2024, absent signs of imminent Recession, SPX remains on track to 6,000. Russell 2000, trading at a below-average premium vs the S&P 500, is expected to Outperform, given the Fed is ready to cut to support growth. Small is Beautiful.\u201d\n\nYardeni Research: \u201cWe expect that stock investors will be focusing on Q2's earnings reporting season over the rest of this month through early August. If earnings turn out to be better than expected (as we project), then the bull market should broaden as investors continue to discount cuts in the federal funds rate later this year, as they did on Thursday and Friday. The breadth of positive three-month forward earnings growth rates among the S&P 500 companies continues to widen.\u201d\n\nBank of America: \u201cThe big question in the market is \u201cis growth slowing too much?\u201d But tamed inflation means the Fed can solely focus on growth, putting the Fed in a much better position, especially after 5.25ppt of hikes. The stars are aligning for the rotation into rate-sensitive cyclicals: rate pressure is easing, growth would ultimately be supported by the Fed, and most importantly, earnings are broadening out as the Other 493 comes out of an earnings recession.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares extend gains as Loop Capital upgrades, assigns new Street-high target\n\nGoldman, Apple, Trump Media rise premarket; SolarEdge falls\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's the Favorite Stock-Split Stock for the World's 10 Richest Billionaire Hedge Fund Managers",
        "content": "Billionaire hedge fund managers consider many variables when deciding which stocks to buy. Financial strength, growth prospects, management, and valuation definitely make the list.\n\nBut there's one thing they probably don't think about that is on the minds of many retail investors: stock splits. One of the top reasons for stock splits is that they make shares more affordable for investors. However, billionaires don't worry about being unable to buy a stock with a high share price.\n\nThat said, these wealthy investors sometimes still like stocks that have undergone or plan to split their shares. Here's the favorite stock-split stock for the world's 10 richest hedge fund managers.\n\nCriteria used\n\nLet me first explain the criteria I used to identify this top stock-split stock. How did I choose the world's 10 richest hedge fund managers? I started with Forbes' ranking of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in 2023.\n\nOne member of the group, Renaissance Technologies founder Jim Simons, passed away last year, so he dropped off my list. I also checked the current net worth of the remaining 20 richest hedge fund managers from 2023 to determine the current ranking. This led to some significant changes in the pecking order.\n\nAfter completing this exercise, here's who made my list of the world's 10 richest hedge fund managers:\n\nRank Manager Hedge Fund Current Net Worth 1 Ken Griffin Citadel $37.7 billion 2 David Tepper Appaloosa Management $20.6 billion 3 Steve Cohen Point72 Management $19.8 billion 4 Michael Platt BlueCrest Capital Management $18 billion 5 Ray Dalio Bridgewater Associates $15.4 billion 6 Israel Englander Millennium Management $12.4 billion 7 Christopher Hohn The Children's Investment Fund $9.5 billion 8 David Shaw D.E. Shaw & Co. $8.3 billion 9 Paul Tudor Jones Tudor Investment Corp. $8.1 billion 10 Bruce Kovner Caxton Associates $7.7 billion\n\nData source: Forbes. Current net worth as of July 11, 2024.\n\nNext, I reviewed the portfolios of each of these hedge fund managers using their latest regulatory filings. Importantly, I only focused on the stocks of companies that have conducted or will conduct stock splits in 2024. Some of these billionaire hedge fund managers -- Christopher Hohn, Paul Tudor Jones, and Bruce Kovner -- didn't own any stock-split stocks that met my criteria.\n\nContenders\n\nThere were several contenders for the top spot. Chipotle Mexican Grill is the second-highest ranked stock-split stock for Ken Griffin's Citadel and David Shaw's D.E. Shaw & Co. hedge funds. The restaurant operator conducted a huge 50-for-1 stock split after the market close on June 25.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom was in the running, too. The semiconductor maker is the largest stock-split holding for Steve Cohen's Point72 Management. Griffin also owns the stock in Citadel's portfolio. Broadcom split its shares 10-for-1 after the market close on July 12.\n\nWalmart is the second-biggest stock-split stock position for Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates. The giant retailer ranks as the No. 3 largest stock-split holding for D.E. Shaw & Co. Walmart conducted a 3-for-1 stock split on Feb. 23.\n\nThe clear stock-split favorite\n\nHowever, one stock-split stock stood head and shoulders above all others in the portfolios of the world's 10 richest hedge fund managers. You probably won't be surprised that the clear favorite is... Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia conducted a highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split following the market close on June 7. This marked the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker's sixth stock split in the company's history.\n\nNvidia ranks as the largest stock-split holding for Griffin's Citadel, David Tepper's Appaloosa Management, Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, Israel Englander's Millennium Management, and Shaw's D.E. Shaw & Co. It is also the second-biggest stock-split position for Cohen's Point72 Management.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia stock?\n\nDon't rush to invest in Nvidia just because several of the richest hedge fund managers in the world own the stock. Several of these billionaires (Griffin, Tepper, Englander, and Shaw) reduced their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter of 2024. But just because they're selling doesn't mean you should automatically follow suit.\n\nEvery investor must make their own decision about whether or not to buy, sell, or hold Nvidia. Ideally, you'll use some of the same factors these billionaire hedge fund managers use in your evaluation. Two of those factors especially go hand-in-hand -- growth prospects and valuation.\n\nSome investors are concerned that Nvidia's growth prospects are already largely incorporated into its valuation. Others think the stock remains undervalued in light of its future growth opportunities.\n\nI'm somewhere in the middle. Nvidia's share price certainly reflects tremendous growth expectations. On the other hand, I won't be surprised if the launch of the company's chips based on the new Blackwell architecture goes even better than anticipated. If so, the stock will almost certainly move higher.\n\nThere's one thing I think every billionaire hedge fund manager and I would agree on, though. Nvidia's stock split is now history and shouldn't influence any investor's decision about buying the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Analysis-Nvidia investor dilemma: how much is too much in a stock portfolio?",
        "content": "By David Randall\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Outsized positions in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia have boosted portfolio managers' returns this year but the bets stand to magnify risk if the chipmaker's red-hot shares see a reversal of fortune.\n\nNvidia shares are up about 785% since the start of 2023 and have risen some 160% this year alone, boosted by demand for its chips, seen as the gold standard in the AI field. Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company in June before a dip in its shares returned that title to Microsoft.\n\nAsset managers\u2019 holdings of the chipmaker have swelled alongside its stock price. Morningstar data showed that 355 actively managed funds held Nvidia positions that totaled 5% or more of their assets at the end of the first quarter, compared to just 108 funds in the same period last year. Funds can maintain large positions in a single holding for a variety of reasons, whether to maximize profits or to track a stock\u2019s weight in an index to which the fund is benchmarked.\n\n\u201cThere's a mindset among some portfolio managers that they missed the boat on Apple or Microsoft and they don't want to be wrong on AI,\" said Jack Shannon, a senior Morningstar analyst. \"They don't want to sell.\u201d\n\nThe oversized positions in Nvidia are another example of how investors have cast their lots with a handful of massive growth stocks, leading to one of the most concentrated market advances ever. Nvidia alone has accounted for around a third of the S&P 500\u2019s nearly 17% gain this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nOverall, markets are the third-narrowest since 1986, with only 24% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperforming the index in the first half, according to BofA Global Research strategists.\n\nFunds that owned Nvidia have so far reaped the benefits. Actively-managed U.S. equity funds that held the stock were up 16.3% on average over the first six months of 2024, compared with an average 5.7% return among those that did not own Nvidia, Morningstar data showed.\n\nYet concentration in a single stock can hurt investors if Nvidia shares hit a rough patch. While the average price target for the stock among analysts stands at $133.45, some 3% above its current level, according to LSEG data, some market participants point to increasing competition, an expected balance between supply and demand as Nvidia ramps up production, and the company's rich valuation as possible reasons for a downturn.\n\nThe stock trades at 39.3 times forward earnings, about 50% more than its industry median, according to LSEG.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cDoes having 6% or more of your portfolio in one stock create outsized risks? The answer is obviously, yes,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \u201cThe fact that one stock did take off like a rocket ship doesn\u2019t mean that it was smart ... to have that many eggs in one basket.\u201d\n\nInvestors got a taste of how concentrated positions can be a two-way street last week, following a sharp, one-day rotation out of Big Tech stocks sparked by cooler inflation data. Nvidia fell nearly 6% on Thursday, its biggest daily drop in more than two weeks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 lost about 2.2%. Both pared those losses the following day.\n\n\u2018TWINGE OF REGRET\u2019\n\nTechnology-sector funds overall have the largest weightings in Nvidia, with four Fidelity funds each holding more than 18% of their assets in the stock, according to Morningstar. Yet other, more diversified, funds appear to be taking on similar risks, with the Baron Fifth Avenue Growth fund holding nearly 15% of its portfolio in Nvidia and the Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund holding about 13% of its portfolio in the stock. Both firms declined to comment.\n\nAnthony Zackery, a portfolio manager at Zevenbergen Capital Investments, has owned Nvidia since 2016 and continues to maintain a core position, though he has trimmed it periodically to keep within his firm\u2019s risk-tolerance guidelines. The fund can hold as much as 13% of one stock in growth portfolios to keep in line with weightings in its benchmark, the Russell 3000 Growth Index.\n\n\"This is a company that is at the forefront of the next trend in technology,\" he said.\n\nSome who sold out entirely, on the other hand, wish they had held on longer.\n\nKevin Landis, chief investment officer at Firsthand Capital Management, said he was \"prudent\" and took profits in 2020 in a Nvidia position he owned for several years. Still, he can\u2019t help thinking about the gains he missed out on.\n\n\"I can\u2019t look at any of my screens now without feeling a twinge of regret,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS. Image source: Apple.\n\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\n\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\n\nThe key differences between these tech titans\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\n\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\n\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\n\nAll three tech giants are growing faster than Apple\n\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Estimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Current Market Capitalization Price-to-Sales Ratio (Forward) Apple 5% 10% $3.57 billion 9 Nvidia 46% 53% $3.26 billion 28 Microsoft 15% 17% $3.47 billion 14 Alphabet 11% 20% $2.37 billion 7\n\nData source: MarketScreener.\n\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\n\nBut look beyond the market caps\n\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran Calls NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) a \u2018Money Machine\u2019",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran. Since NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\n\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Best AI Value Stock That is \u2018Money Machine\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nNVIDIA Corp Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nAswath Damodoran has been skeptical about NVDA over the past several months, saying repeatedly that the stock looks overvalued. In March, when he was asked about his previous predictions (that proved wrong) about NVDA valuation, the professor said that either he has \u201cno idea what I\u2019m talking about\u201d or it\u2019s the market that just does not understand.\n\nAswath Damodoran at the time said that while Nvidia was in the \u201cdriving seat\u201d of the AI bandwagon, its path to profits won\u2019t be as easy as the market assumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\n\nNVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight. NVIDIA\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0shares have gained about 206% over the past one year.\n\nRecently, Barclays Tom O\u2019Malley gave bullish comments on the stock, with a $145 price target and an Overweight rating. The analyst pointed to a potential $25 billion opportunity from countries building up their AI capabilities. O\u2019Malley expects NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings at $3.62 per share in fiscal 2026, while Wall Street analysts on average have a $3.55 per share estimate for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings for 2026.\n\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system-on-a-chip units for the mobile computing and automotive markets. The company has experienced strong performance recently due to booming demand for its data center products, particularly those related to artificial intelligence. A major driver of Nvidia\u2019s recent success has been the growing adoption of its GPU accelerators for AI training and inference across various end markets. The company\u2019s GPUs have become an industry standard for training large language models (LLMs), and its networking solutions, such as NVLink and InfiniBand, are critical to maximizing the performance of AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell GPU platform is expected to further extend its lead in the AI accelerator market, with significant performance and total cost of ownership benefits over its predecessors. As the AI market continues to expand with growing adoption across enterprises and sovereign nations, we expect Nvidia to maintain its dominance and experience sustained growth in its data center business. Beyond data centers, Nvidia has also benefited from strong demand in its gaming business, which has recovered after a period of inventory digestion in 2022. The company\u2019s gaming GPUs have been well-received, and its focus on the high-end market has supported growth in average selling prices. Looking ahead, we expect the gaming market to remain healthy with ongoing growth potential. Nvidia also sees opportunities to diversify its business and foray into new markets, such as automotive and robotics. We continued to hold our position in Nvidia.\u201d\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "4 Threats to Nvidia Every Investor Needs to Know",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is well underway and investors are looking for opportunities to strike it rich. The November 2022 launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT for public use sparked the rush, helping push numerous stocks to new heights and contributing heavily to the S&P 500 index being up almost 42% over that timeframe. One of the biggest beneficiaries has been semiconductor specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's rise has been quite the story of the last few years; it's up about 726% since ChatGPT's launch. Over the past five years, it's up nearly 3,000%.\n\nNvidia keeps reporting massive earnings growth quarter after quarter, justifying an ever-higher stock price. The company is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) only slightly higher than at the close of 2022. That's impressive considering the outstanding stock price appreciation over that time. Take a look at the company's earnings growth below compared to its share price over the past three years. Notice how the two keep pace with each other? NVDA Chart\n\nNvidia is keeping up with market expectations, at least thus far. Its dominance of the AI chip market and the vision it displayed to get there is impressive.\n\nPast performance has been great, but investing is more about anticipating future performance and buying based on where you think the company is going. Investors should also consider what obstacles stand in the way of a company continuing to find success. Let's take a look at four potential threats that could significantly impact Nvidia's business (and its stock) in the future.\n\n1. Nvidia will see increased competition from multiple directions\n\nWhen you become one of the largest companies in the world in a relatively short time, you better expect competition to heat up. Nvidia proved that providing chips to the AI industry is a massively lucrative business, and others want in on the action. The most obvious competition comes from other chipmakers, most notably Advanced Micro Devices. The longtime rival of Nvidia has set its sights on taking market share. AMD CEO Lisa Su said at a recent unveiling of AMD's latest chips that in no uncertain terms, \"AI is our No. 1 priority.\"\n\nWhile this will put pressure on Nvidia, a bigger threat might actually involve the Big Tech clients currently fueling Nvidia's massive revenue growth. A significant portion of Nvidia's revenue is concentrated among firms like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Amazon. If that business dries up, it spells trouble for Nvidia's bottom line.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy would it dry up? The cost of AI chips is so great that some of these companies are working to design their own, in-house. This will take time, and success is far from guaranteed -- it turns out that designing advanced microchips that can be built at scale is really hard -- but any one of these companies, let alone several or all, replacing Nvidia chips with their own would likely be disastrous.\n\n2. Changes in the AI models that use Nvidia chips could lead to a drop in demand\n\nWithout going into too much technical detail (which I'm in no way qualified to discuss) about the way AI algorithms function (especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT), they seem to be suited perfectly to the kind of chip Nvidia designs, and they require a lot of them. This led to the massive demand that is driving Nvidia's revenue.\n\nHowever, technology can change, sometimes very quickly. A different kind of AI model could come into vogue that favors a different kind of chip or is significantly more efficient and needs fewer chips to function. A recent scientific paper proposes a new AI model that does just that, requiring only 10% of the chips used by current models. This would likely drive the demand for Nvidia's chips down significantly and wreak havoc on the company's bottom line.\n\n3. Shifts in geopolitics could impact on Nvidia's ability to operate\n\nNvidia designs its chips and the software needed to operate them, but it shops out the production of those chips primarily through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is based in Taiwan.\u00a0Although it's unlikely to happen in the near future, the threat of China invading Taiwan should be taken seriously. If that happens, relations between China and the U.S. would be extremely fraught. Even if direct military conflict was avoided, it's very possible that Nvidia's operations in Taiwan would be shut down completely or boycotted by multiple countries. Relocating the manufacturing of Nvidia chips would be extremely costly for the company.\n\n4. It's possible that the promise of AI never materializes\n\nIf AI turns out to be a bust, that is perhaps the biggest threat to the company. The promise of AI to revolutionize multiple sectors of the economy has been so hyped that most investors expect it is a foregone conclusion at this point. The sizeable amount of money flowing into the space is largely built on the promise of strong future returns.\n\nNvidia's revenue over the past two years is real; I'm not disputing that. However, the demand for its chips will ultimately only be as strong as the demand for end-user AI technologies -- technologies that deliver real economic value on par with the money being spent to develop and implement them. I am not saying this won't happen, only that it wouldn't be the first time a technology failed to deliver on the hype surrounding it (the hype around the metaverse is just the latest example of this).\n\nIt's important to maintain a healthy skepticism in the midst of a run like Nvidia has had. Knowing this and knowing about the other potential threats will make you an informed Nvidia investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "U.S. equities markets continue on their jaw-dropping rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has risen 22.6% since the start of the year, while the S&P 500 has hit a record, rising 18.1% on a year-to-date basis. \u00a0The rally is largely a continuation of what we had observed in 2023, a clear extension of the so-called \u201cAI craze.\u201d However, as we get further into the year cracks appear to be forming at the surface. AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) had a brief moment of assuming the position as the world\u2019s most valuable company, but shortly after, the company\u2019s share price entered correction territory. This underscores some of the fragility in markets that is bubbling. As a result, many investors are seeking out short sellers.\n\nValuations and prices have already become stretched, and certain stocks that have benefitted from the AI hype or other market crazes could see their prices tank if their growth and earnings don\u2019t pick up. This means it could be a great time for short sellers. Below are 3 overpriced darlings that could make hefty profits for short sellers.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe rise of SoundHound AI\u2018s (NASDAQ:SOUN) shares is a direct result of the aforementioned AI craze. Once Nvidia revealed it had invested into the conversational AI startup, SOUN shares soared. SoundHound AI\u2019s stock price rose as much as 320.2% for the year by mid-March. However, investors piling into the company\u2019s stock became sorely disappointed after short seller Capybara Research released a pretty damning report. The short seller alleged the company\u2019s conversation AI product leveraged \u201ccommodity speech recognition.\u201d In other words, SoundHound AI\u2019s software isn\u2019t particularly special, particularly when tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet have been developing in-house voice recognition technologies for years at this point.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoundHound\u2019s share price has still more than doubled on a year-to-date basis. What\u2019s more is that the startup is far away from being profitable. Not to mention it trades at a frothy 20.4x forward sales. It\u2019s no wonder SoundHound\u2019s short interest sits at 21.4%.\n\nNIO (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nNIO (NYSE:NIO) is a Chinese EV maker that has seen its shares struggle in recent months. The EV maker focuses on the upper-end segment of the market, and while that has created a somewhat sticky customer base, NIO is struggling with the intense competitive environment of China\u2019s EV industry. In May and June, investors were elated to hear NIO delivered record numbers of electric vehicles. According to a press release, for the second quarter of 2024, NIO delivered 57,373 vehicles, which represented an increase of 143.9% year-over-year. Cumulative deliveries now stand at 537,020 as of June 30, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, hiked tariffs from the European Union, an international market NIO had seen as key to its expansion plans, and a stretched valuation could see NIO\u2019s share price continue to tank in the near term. NIO shares have plummeted nearly 50% on a year-to-date basis, yet short interest for NIO\u2019s stock still sits at an elevated 9.1%.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is another well-known software firm and benefactor the AI market craze. However, the data analytics firm has definitely come far from where it started. Instead of focusing solely developing software products for defense agencies and contractors, Palantir has moved on to servicing a variety of industries, and this has not only helped fuel its growth but also pushed the firm into GAAP net profit territory. Amidst last year\u2019s hype around generative artificial intelligence technologies, Palantir decided to put together a new platform-AIP-that would layer large language models on top of the analytics software Palantir customers were already using.\n\nThough this platform is still in its early testing phases, PLTR shares have rallied since then, causing its valuation to balloon. Palantir trades at 83.9x forward earnings, which is nearly twice that of Nvidia. The data analytics firm\u2019s first quarter results already hinted that AIP isn\u2019t boosting future revenue and earnings as much as analysts were hoping either.\n\nThose who think PLTR\u2019s current valuation is tenable in the long-term likely have a surprise coming. Short sellers haven\u2019t caught on to this yet, given Palantir\u2019s relatively low short interest, but they very well could as Wall Street continues to scrutinize trading multiples and earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Intel Stock: Last Chance for a Comeback or Time to Abandon Ship?",
        "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the biggest technology disappointment of the century, so far, but it\u2019s still the most important tech company of this decade. Some are saying now is the time to buy Intel stock.\n\nIntel\u2019s failures over two decades came under a series of marketing executives. Its rise, if it is to happen, will be because of Pat Gelsinger. He\u2019s a manufacturing executive who started his career at Intel but was at VMWare when he was called back in early 2020. He understands fabrication.\n\nFabrication and Intel Stock\n\nGelsinger\u2019s strategy is to rebuild Intel as an American chip manufacturer, with new \u201cfabs\u201d in Ohio and Arizona, and substantial government help. Since he took command in February 2020, the stock has lost almost half its value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGelsinger is putting $100 billion into his foundry plan over five years. Your tax dollars represent $8.5 billion of that. He says the company\u2019s goal is to have half the world\u2019s most advanced chips produced in the U.S. or Europe by the end of the decade.\n\nIntel moved its manufacturing offshore during the 20th century, most notably to China, because it was cheaper. Chinese workers earned less. China\u2019s environmental regulation was lax, and local protests easily ignored.\n\nIntel Foundry will have higher running costs, and Gelsinger will still hand off work to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) when necessary.\n\nIntel\u2019s Arrow Lake processors, due later this year, will have circuit lines just 2 nanometers apart. Intel calls this distance \u201c20 Angstroms,\u201d and plans to hit 18 Angstroms next year. In 2026 it hopes to reach 14 Angstroms.\n\nThe promise of this approach can be seen in the success of Taiwan Semiconductor, now best known for making Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. TSMC\u2019s stock is up 86% this year, 358% over the last five years, and it\u2019s now worth nearly 7 times Intel. Its market cap briefly touched $1 trillion recently before falling back.\n\nThe Bear Thesis\n\nIt\u2019s on the design side of chip making that Intel is getting killed.\n\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is licensing its Intel-compatible CPU design to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nNvidia is also licensing ARM technology for a gaming CPU, due out next year. Even if that chip is made at an Intel foundry, most of its value will be in the software.\n\nIntel still has four-fifths of the CPU market. It\u2019s hard to see that continuing in the face of the multi-ARM race that\u2019s coming.\n\nIntel should easily reach $55 billion in sales this year. But it had $79 billion in sales when Gelsinger took over. Profits are down 80% and the company is expected to earn just $1.01 per share this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two reasons why some analysts are putting Intel back on their buy lists. First is the expectation that those new foundries will soon generate a return. Second is its relative valuation, now just over twice sales, at a time when TSMC is selling for nearly 25 times sales and the AI tide keeps rising.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvestors have been sitting on losses in Intel for years now.\n\nAnalysts who, like me, have bought Gelsinger\u2019s promises, counseled patience, and bet on the foundry plan look very stupid right now.\n\nBut Intel is, as I\u2019ve said, the most essential company in the U.S.. If Intel can\u2019t make the foundry work, America\u2019s hopes of regaining the semiconductor market will go with it. So will a lot of your tax dollars.\n\nBut I\u2019m past taking promises at face value. Intel is running out of time. At TipRanks the professional analysts have mostly moved on. At Stocktwits, traders are neutral.\n\nIf Gelsinger can\u2019t get some profits out of the foundry soon, maybe it\u2019s time to sell out to the Chinese. If he can, watch out, because right now no one believes it.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in NVDA, TSM and INTC.

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia This Year? Here Are 2 Stocks That Could Make Up for That.",
        "content": "Missing out on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has likely been a frustrating experience for many investors. Although most people have exposure to it indirectly through index funds, it's nothing compared to owning the stock directly.\n\nHowever, I've got two stocks with substantial upside potential that might be able to make up for some of the performance you've missed out on by not owning Nvidia directly.\n\nUiPath\n\nFirst is UiPath (NYSE: PATH). In a year when nearly any stock associated with artificial intelligence (AI) has gone up, UiPath hasn't had the same luxury. In fact, the stock is down about 50% this year although much of that decline is unjustified, in my opinion.\n\nUiPath makes robotic process automation (RPA) software. This allows its users to automate repetitive tasks and allows its clients to focus on projects that require original thinking. It also has various AI plug-ins that broaden the scope of what it can automate. While the RPA market is fairly young, Grand View Research expects this market to grow at nearly a 40% compound annual rate, reaching a global market size of more than $30 billion by 2030.\n\nIn the long term, UiPath's success will be fairly straightforward if it can maintain its market leadership position. However, it has been a bumpy 2024.\n\nUiPath's report for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended April 30) was packed with information, and not much was good. UiPath cut its full-year revenue outlook and also reverted to an unprofitable state. Its CEO also resigned, although he had only had the role for a few months. Replacing him is former CEO and founder Daniel Dines, so it's not a massive shakeup.\n\nAlthough the stock struggled heading into earnings, this was enough to send shares crashing over 30%.\n\nSo why can UiPath turn it around? First, its market opportunity is massive, and UiPath is a leader in the field. Second, having the founder-CEO return to the role brings some familiarity to the job. Lastly, UiPath is correcting its profitability slip by laying off around 10% of its workforce, something many companies did last year. PATH PS Ratio Chart\n\nUiPath is taking the right steps to bounce back, and the stock is also dirt cheap. At 5 times sales, the stock represents massive value, especially for a recently profitable company that is still expected to grow in the mid-double-digit range. While it may not be Nvidia, it does have the potential to double fairly easily with some good news.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is often described as the Amazon of Latin America thanks to its dominant e-commerce platform and massive logistics network. However, it also has a thriving fintech wing, making it much more diverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, MercadoLibre has been downright dominant in its market, with Q1 currency-neutral revenue growth of 94%. It's also improving its profit margins, which rose to 7.9% versus 6.3% last year.\n\nThis is just a continuation of MercadoLibre's decade-long success story. With the massive Latin American population it serves, there is far more growth ahead for MercadoLibre. Despite that, the stock trades far below where it was throughout most of the 2010s. MELI PS Ratio Chart\n\nWhile I'm not arguing that the stock should be worth more than 20 times sales, I do think the valuation could be higher due to its growth. Regardless, MercadoLibre has a massive growth runway, and investors shouldn't be surprised if its stock behaves like Amazon's over the long term: a massive market beater.\n\nIt's hard for a company growing incredibly fast while improving margins to underperform the market, which gives me confidence that MercadoLibre could be a stock that makes up for missing out on Nvidia over the next three to five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in UiPath right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in UiPath, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and UiPath wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Broadcom a Better Stock-Split Buy Than Nvidia? Wall Street Thinks So.",
        "content": "It's a leader in technology that powers artificial intelligence (AI) models. Its revenue is soaring. Its shares have skyrocketed. It announced a 10-for-1 stock split this year.\n\nWhich stock am I talking about? There are two correct answers: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). However, Nvidia has been the bigger star of the two.\n\nBut could that change? Is Broadcom a better stock-split buy than Nvidia? Wall Street thinks so.\n\nWhat analysts think about Broadcom and Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been a Wall Street darling for several years. It's fair to say now, though, that there's no longer a consensus about the high-flying AI stock.\n\nThree months ago, 54 of the 58 analysts surveyed by LSEG rated Nvidia as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" However, of the 38 analysts surveyed so far in July, only 21 still put the stock in one of those two categories. Fifteen analysts now rate Nvidia as a \"hold\" with two recommending investors sell the stock.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Nvidia compiled by LSEG from 48 analysts is a little below the current share price. The most pessimistic analyst (admittedly an outlier) thinks the stock could plunge more than 60%.\n\nIt's a much better story for Broadcom. LSEG surveyed 29 analysts this month to get their take on the stock; 27 of them rated it as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy.\" The remaining two analysts rate Broadcom as a \"hold.\"\n\nGranted, Wall Street doesn't think Broadcom will deliver the sizzling gains over the next 12 months that it has over the past year. However, the average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of nearly 10%.\n\nWhy Broadcom is viewed more favorably\n\nWhat changed to make Wall Street more bullish about Broadcom than Nvidia? The simple answer is that Nvidia has become a victim of its own success.\n\nThe stock is up more than 160% so far in 2024. This impressive performance comes on the heels of a gain of nearly 240% last year. Many analysts think Nvidia's sales will continue to grow robustly, but this growth is already baked into the share price.\n\nNewStreet Research analyst Pierre Ferragu even downgraded Nvidia stock recently from a \"buy\" to \"neutral.\" He wrote to investors that he sees \"limited further upside\" for Nvidia after its tremendous returns over the last 18 months or so.\n\nMeanwhile, Broadcom's valuation remains relatively attractive despite its strong gains. The stock trades at 29 times forward earnings, well below Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of 49.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Wall Street right?\n\nI agree with analysts in some ways. Although Broadcom's valuation isn't exactly cheap, the company doesn't have to generate the dizzying level of growth that Nvidia must deliver to justify its premium price. You could argue that Broadcom is a lower-risk pick.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me at all if Broadcom hits the average analysts' price target over the next 12 months (and probably sooner). The company should enjoy solid growth over the next few quarters from its VMware acquisition and demand for its AI accelerators.\n\nHowever, I'm not completely on the same page as Wall Street's views about Nvidia. I've been guilty in the past of underestimating the chipmaker's growth potential. My hunch is that Nvidia's launch of its new Blackwell platform in the coming months could go better than most analysts expect. If so, look for multiple rounds of upward price target revisions in the not-too-distant future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Sold $169 Million in Stock During the First Half of 2024. Time to Worry?",
        "content": "The stock leading the markets up this year, and really for the past two years, has been Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which briefly became the most valuable company in the world in June before falling back to its close third-place position.\n\nAs the stock made new highs, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, along with other Nvidia insiders, sold a substantial amount of stock in June -- and have continued selling this month. So, how should current Nvidia shareholders take these sales, and should they be worried?\n\n$169 million for Huang, $700 million for other insiders\n\nIn June, Huang sold 1.3 million shares of Nvidia, bringing in $169 million worth to his personal wealth. The June sales were Huang's first sales of the year. In addition, other insiders sold $700 million worth of stock.\n\nNot only that, but since the calendar flipped to July, Huang has sold another 480,000 shares worth a little over $60 million, bringing his total 2024 sales to roughly 1.78 million shares worth $230 million.\n\nThat's a lot of money. But is it reason for Nvidia investors to be worried?\n\nWhy Nvidia shareholders shouldn't be worried over stock sales\n\nThe sales in and of themselves shouldn't be much of a worry for shareholders. After all, Huang still owned over 934 million shares (split-adjusted) at the beginning of June. That means his June and July sales have only equaled 0.2% of his total holdings!\n\nSo while the sales amount to a lot in dollar terms, they're not much to be worried about in terms of Huang's total net worth. In fact, given Nvidia's meteoric rise over the past 18 months, one would have probably expected Huang to cash out even more.\n\nFurthermore, Huang's sales have come as a result of a 10b5-1 trading program. This is a type of program that executives often make with brokerage houses to sell shares of their company's stock, up to a certain amount and at a pre-determined level. Often, there is a delay between when an executive announces the program and when the brokerage house starts trading shares. In this case, Huang actually adopted the 10b5-1 program on March 14, exactly three months before the first sales on June 13.\n\nThe plan is scheduled to run through March 2025 and may have an upper limit of 6 million shares. So even after all of June and July's sales to date, there is still a majority of the plan's sales remaining. Even if the entire plan is sold through March 2025, that would still amount to less than 0.65% of Huang's ownership stake. Image source: Nvidia.\n\nBut there are other valid concerns around Nvidia stock right now\n\nWhile Jensen Huang's share sales are definitely not a reason to panic and sell Nvidia shares, there are a few risks to which shareholders should be paying attention.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first is the possibility AI investment doesn't keep up its torrid pace. In recent days, there have been reports suggesting the pace of AI spending could come to halt. In late June, Goldman Sachs' head of equity research Jim Covello put out a note saying the AI spending boom has many similarities with the dot-com bubble.\n\nSpecifically, Covello doesn't believe the use cases for AI will result in revenues or cost savings that justify the current level of investment. He believes investors are pressuring companies to invest in or experiment with AI with \"completely unclear\" uses for the current AI technology.\n\nSimilarly, around the same time, a partner at the famed venture capital firm Sequoia penned a blog post stating that he also doesn't believe cloud and software giants will generate enough incremental AI revenue to justify this level of investment.\n\nAside from AI use cases, there are also competitive worries, especially since Nvidia is currently generating astronomically high margins. Not only are rivals Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) coming out with new AI chips and open-sourced software in an attempt to break through Nvidia's CUDA software moat, but every cloud giant out there is also now making its own low-cost, in-house AI accelerators.\n\nBut Nvidia could very well still defy skeptics\n\nIt should be noted other economists aren't as pessimistic on AI. In fact, even another Goldman analyst, senior economist Joseph Briggs, disagreed with Covello, and believes AI-related cost-savings and revenue will be higher than Covello's forecast as the technology improves.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia does have a powerful first-mover advantage that should still give it a large market share of AI computing, which should lead to growth even as more competitors come on to the scene. That is, of course, provided AI investment delivers returns for companies downstream.\n\nAll in all, Huang's stock sales are not a reason to worry about Nvidia stock. But the uncertain proliferation of AI use cases and incoming competition are.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock After Its 10-for-1 Split?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest industries for investors right now. Semiconductor darling and data center specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is considered by many on Wall Street to be a lucrative opportunity for AI enthusiasts.\n\nWith shares of Nvidia up over 170% so far in 2024, some investors may think they've missed the boat.\n\nLet's take a look at what is going on at Nvidia, and assess if now is still a reasonable time to scoop up some shares.\n\nNvidia's hot start to 2024\n\n2023 marked a new age for the technology industry. Behemoths such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon all made a series of splashy investments revolving around AI applications.\n\nSome of the bigger investments these tech giants made were buying AI-powered semiconductor chips, as well as ramping up data center services. Considering Nvidia has an estimated 80% share of the AI chip market, these moves by big tech undoubtedly served as a big boost to the company.\n\nThe strong momentum from last year's AI euphoria carried into 2024, and Nvidia investors haven't stopped buying up the stock. To put this into context, shares of Nvidia have increased almost 800% since January 2023.\n\nThis unprecedented run briefly catapulted Nvidia over Microsoft as the world's most valuable company by market cap. Moreover, as shares continued to eclipse new heights, Nvidia's management finally decided to implement a 10-for-1 stock split last month. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is more than just a chip opportunity\n\nWhat's incredible is that much of the narrative surrounding Nvidia deals with the company's chip business. Indeed, its H100 and A100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are used by companies all around the world -- including Meta Platforms and Tesla.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is continuing to lead the innovation front in the GPU realm with the introduction of its new Blackwell and Rubin chips.\n\nWith that said, it's important to understand that Nvidia makes money from other products and services as well. In fact, one of its lesser-known growth opportunities is outside of hardware.\n\nNvidia's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) software platform is already proving to be a lucrative business. Essentially, CUDA is a programming tool that is meant to be used in parallel with Nvidia's GPUs. So, in a sense, the company is attempting to build out an end-to-end AI ecosystem encompassing both hardware and software.\n\nOne of the big reasons CUDA is going to be important for Nvidia is due to competition in the chip space. Companies such as AMD, Intel, and even Amazon and Meta are all working on competing GPUs to that of Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough it's too early to get a sense of how these competing products will impact Nvidia, I think it's reasonably safe to say that the company will eventually lose some of its pricing power in the chip space. As a result, Nvidia's profit margins are likely to take a hit at some point in the future. However, some of this margin deterioration should be mitigated so long as CUDA continues to thrive. The reason is because software products tend to carry much higher margins than hardware.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Nvidia stock?\n\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiples over the last 12 months. While a P/E of 75.9 and a P/FCF of 82.2 may look pricey, there are a couple of ideas to explore here. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nFirst, both Nvidia's P/E and P/FCF multiples are lower than they were a year ago. In other words, despite the rapid ascent of the stock price, Nvidia's earnings and cash flow are accelerating at a faster rate -- therefore, Nvidia stock is technically less expensive today than it was 12 months ago.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's commanding lead in the chip space and its under-the-radar software services should be analyzed further. The company is an investor in Databricks, one of the most valuable AI start-ups in the world. Nvidia is also an investor in Figure AI -- a developer of humanoid robotics.\n\nI do not think that opportunities in robotics and AI software are priced into Nvidia stock yet. I think many of these applications are currently overshadowed by the performance of the chip business, and many investors are discounting the potential Nvidia has in other areas in the AI arena.\n\nLong-term investors have an opportunity to gain exposure to many different aspects of AI simply through Nvidia. Despite the meteoric rise in share price, the valuation analysis above, as well as some of the other growth opportunities explored make a compelling case that Nvidia stock is a good buy right now and significant upside could very much be in store.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Healthcare Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Over the years, especially the past three, I have become more cautious about the technology sector\u2019s blatant overvaluation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ignore the capabilities of companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and their innovative solutions for AI. Although, in my opinion, the market\u2019s optimism has still led to high valuations. This is why I am shifting my focus to undervalued healthcare stocks as a means of protecting myself from the overvaluation of the technology sector.\n\nI think that the healthcare market overall is undervalued since we\u2019re gone through a couple of cycles into very high-growth assets such as in the Nasdaq and Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which rose 78.94% and 522.11%, respectively over the past five years. Comparatively, ETFs like the Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSEARCA:VHT) rose just 55.73% over the same period, which to me indicates there\u2019s a good amount of potential left in the market.\r\n\r\nSo here are three undervalued healthcare stocks for investors to buy this month.\n\nNovartis AG (NVS) nvs stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNovartis (NYSE:NVS) is a global healthcare company that has great potential moving forward. It has risen 9.41% year-to-date and has momentum on its side, offering both capital appreciation and income potential benefits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, I think Novartis is one of the best healthcare stocks that any dividend growth investor should have in the portfolio. The quarter one results of the company are quite good where the company has beaten the revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates. To me this shows the strength of its pipeline as well as its commercial ability.\n\nThe group\u2019s core growth products such as Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, Kisqali and Leqvio are performing well. Since these brands are newer, it was revealed they are more than strong enough to prevent the erosion of its older product base, which will keep its earnings and free cash flow coming to support its impressive shareholder yield at 6.44%, which is above the industry average.\n\nHCA Healthcare (HCA) two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallway\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) operates hospitals and surgery centers in the U.S. and the U.K.\n\nFor some context, HCA Healthcare is one of the companies that I am now very positive about and I think the reward constitutes the risk at this point. HCA\u2019s good performance in the Q1 with high revenue growth, increasing demand, and widening margins prove that HCA is a well-positioned company.\n\nIt was revealed in last quarter\u2019s results that HCA\u2019s deferred procedures are reducing at a rapid rate as pent-up demand is being released. This is a continued blowback from COVID, and I think we\u2019re seeing a revitalization in demand for operating procedures as we did for air travel when restrictions were first lifted. For example, same-facility admissions were up a staggering 6.2% in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal healthcare spending is still far behind where it was during the pandemic, so I believe that traditional hospitals such as HCA will see a rise in demand as spending normalizes.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies globally.\n\nWhat really interests me is the oncology segment and the opportunities for Pfizer. The Seagen acquisition was a turning point, it more than doubled Pfizer\u2019s presence in this fast-growing segment. Pfizer knows what it is doing by shifting its focus to biologics (drugs made from living organisms) because they have longer market protection than what is seen with older drugs.\n\nPfizer also has a healthy pipeline with more than 100 programs in the pipeline of which 37 are in the final stage of development. The firm\u2019s scale and resources are unparalleled, which gives it a competitive edge in research and development as well as commercialization.\n\nPFE\u2019s stock price has fallen 20.37% over the past year, which may be concerning. However, I see an opportunity, as investors can snap up a 5.86% dividend yield at these prices while they wait for the oncology segment to ramp up PFE\u2019s earnings.\n\nGilead Sciences (GILD) A Gilead Sciences (GILD) sign at the company headquarters in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nGilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) focuses on antiviral drugs. Also, like other undervalued healthcare stocks, GILD\u2019s stock price has turned negative, dropping 8.39% over the past year.\n\nThere is one major bright spot, however, and that is Gilead\u2019s HIV business which remains a cash cow and should continue to grow. The new Phase 3 data for lenacapavir is a game-changer because it was shown to be 100% effective in preventing HIV in cisgender women during trials. The biennial dosing of lenacapavir puts it ahead of other rivals that require more aggressive dosing, and I believe that its peak estimated sales of $3 billion has not been fully reflected in the market price.\n\nOn paper, GILD also looks cheap at its current fundamentals. In fact, there\u2019s a massive mismatch between its trailing and forward earnings, at a staggering 199x and 9.8x, respectively. Analysts then have very bullish forecasts for the company, and I believe that these forecast are well-deserved.\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a leading medical device company. I think it\u2019s one of those undervalued healthcare stocks for a few different reasons. Firstly, around 80% of MDT\u2019s revenue is derived from recurring sources, which makes it less sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and should be assumed to be easier to value due to there being less variance in its financials quarter-over-quarter.\n\nMDT is also relatively cheap with a forward P/E ratio of 14x which is far lower than that of S&P 500 at 27x as well as other companies in the medtech industry. The stock presents a good mix of economic stability, capital appreciation potential, as well as income potential. MDT has steadily grown its dividend since its inception and has 48 years of growth behind it.\n\nCompanies like MDT that have this trifecta could become important anchor stocks in the event of a stock market correction for growth darlings such as NVDA, especially as it offers a low beta, income, and a relatively undervalued share price compared to the broader market.\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) Close up of Abbott Laboratories sign at their headquarters in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nSome undervalued healthcare stocks on this list struggled severely post-COVID, but this is not the case with Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a diversified global healthcare company. The company did suffer headwinds from lower COVID-19-test sales but its base business and ex-COVID delivery grew over 10% organically for the fifth quarter in a row.\n\nAbbott is one of the stocks that is supported by the ongoing bull market and the shareholder returns are one of the reasons for this. It pays a dividend that has grown for 50 consecutive years, but what really puts Abbott in a class of its own is the rate of dividend growth. Based on the 5-year dividend CAGR of more than 12%, and the moderately conservative payout ratio of about 48%, it would be reasonable to expect high single digit increases to be sustained into the future.\n\nABT\u2019s dividend at around 2% might not be enough for those seeking immediate, substantial income, but its growth rate could be very appealing for those who have a time horizon of 20 years or more to allow compounding to work its magic.\n\nTenet Healthcare (THC) a doctor looks at a tablet. Healthcare stocks to avoid\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) operates hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the U.S. THC has very strong momentum behind it, having risen over 60% over the past year alone. There are a few things to unpack in order to understand the thesis for THC.\n\nTenet\u2019s decision to offload non-core assets, in this case underperforming hospitals, has been welcomed by the market as a strategic move. These divestitures have delivered a substantial amount of proceeds (over $2.5 billion after-tax) and at the same time, these divestitures helped Tenet to divest low-margin, capital-intensive businesses and to re-allocate resources to the faster growing, more profitable lines of businesses including ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). This is a positive sign of management\u2019s intent to find new opportunities to deploy this capital for higher returns in the future.\n\nThe rotation of capital back to more profitable assets is one of the key reasons I think THC is still undervalued despite trading at 16 times forward earnings, but it may take some time in order for the company to reap the synergies it seeks from the assets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Look At Buying NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)?",
        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a significant share price rise of 70% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The recent share price gains has brought the company back closer to its yearly peak. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at NVIDIA\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for NVIDIA\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In NVIDIA?\n\nAccording to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 74.56x is currently well-above the industry average of 31.27x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NVIDIA\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of NVIDIA look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NVIDIA's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? NVDA\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on NVDA for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

        "title": "The 7 Most Important Stocks to Watch as Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Off",
        "content": "Earnings season is a combination report card and progress report. The headline results tell investors what already happened. There\u2019s nothing that can be done about it. That\u2019s the report card part of it. It\u2019s the guidance a company gives that can tell investors what may be coming in future quarters. That\u2019s the progress that investors want to hear when thinking about Q2 earnings season stocks to buy.\n\nThe latest read on inflation showed a slight slowdown in the rate of growth. And many investors now believe that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September with increasing optimism that there may be more than one rate cut in 2024.\n\nThe market (i.e. institutional investors) is always looking months ahead. That\u2019s one reason the market seemingly defies gravity. Those investors believe the next directional move for interest rates is lower, and they\u2019re investing accordingly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to keep up with every earnings report. But, let\u2019s examine seven Q2 earnings season stocks that investors should watch closely.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 150% making it one of the best-performing stocks in 2024.\u00a0However, it\u2019s listing as one the Q2 earnings season stocks to watch has less to do with the future stock price movement of NVDA stock than it does with demand for the company\u2019s chips.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, the market is becoming increasingly optimistic about a pivot by the Fed. But will businesses share this optimism? If they do, NVIDIA will be one of the beneficiaries.\n\nCompanies in every sector are racing to create artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And NVIDIA is creating the hardware that these companies need to power those applications. For much of the last 18 months, investors have shrugged off any concerns about a lofty valuation. And for the most part, the company has delivered the revenue and earnings outlook to reassure them. Investors are expecting more of the same, and that\u2019s why it will be a report to watch.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome investors will say this list of Q2 earnings season stocks to watch should simply include the magnificent seven stocks. But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be the last one to include in this group. It used to be said that as Apple goes, so goes the market. That title may now go to Nvidia, but Apple still has one of the strongest moats a company can have. That shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nAfter a rough first quarter, AAPL stock has come roaring back. The stock is up about 33% in this past quarter. The company has outlined its AI strategy. That will be showcased in its upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, even with some analysts bidding the stock higher, Apple continues to have its share of critics. Those detractors believe this earnings report will be a prove-it moment. The iPhone 16 won\u2019t launch until September. But investors will focus closely on what Apple has to say about their manufacturing plans.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is another obvious choice as one of the stocks to watch this earnings season. In its last earnings report, the company confirmed that many consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. It also said that it\u2019s seeing more affluent consumers choosing Walmart. And not so quietly, the company has become a digital force to be reckoned with. Global e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year (YOY) in the last quarter.\n\nBut earnings reports are about looking ahead. Walmart has recently announced it has opened five automated distribution centers across the U.S. These will help the country manage fresh food for its online grocery business.\n\nThe bigger story is that Walmart plans to expand this use of automation throughout its stores and fulfillment centers in the coming years. All of this will take robust capital expenditures. However, make no mistake. This will also help the company offset rising labor costs. That will be accretive to the company\u2019s earnings over time.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nOutside of AI, two of the best-performing stocks are Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and NovoNordisk (NYSE:NVO). Both companies manufacture and sell GLP-1 drugs for treating diabetes and obesity.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Ell Lilly reported $1.8 billion in revenue for its GLP-1 diabetes drug, Mounjaro. It also reported $517 million in revenue for Zepbound, the company\u2019s GLP-1 obesity drug. LLY stock is up more than 60% for the year and 112% in the last 12 months.\n\nBut as the drugs become commonplace, it\u2019s fair to ask which company\u2019s drugs are better. A recent study suggests that Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound are producing better results for weight loss than those of Novo Nordisk. The study was not sponsored by Lilly which creates the reason for the intrigue.\n\nLilly is conducting its own head-to-head study comparing the two drugs. That will be one key point of interest for investors to watch when the company reports earnings scheduled for August 8, 2024.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to be a barometer for the economy. The company has recovered from the pandemic. But as its most recent earnings report showed, the company is having problems with difficult comparisons to last year. This reinforces investor sentiment that the consumer is tapped out.\n\nCurrently, SBUX stock is approaching its 52-week low. For all the talk that the consumer discretionary sector has hit a bottom, the stock seems to find new lows. And the earnings report from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) won\u2019t do much to allay those fears. However, with the stock down 23% for the year, the buying pressure seems overdone.\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if that trends reverses when Starbucks reports earnings on August 6. They\u2019ll also be watching for progress on the company\u2019s \u201cSiren Craft System\u201d which is the company\u2019s initiative to alter its drink-making process to help make the job or its baristas easier. In the meantime, investors can benefit from an attractive dividend that has been growing for 14 consecutive years and has a 3.11% yield.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerception frequently shapes reality. That\u2019s why the economy won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s on firm footing until the housing market improves. And it\u2019s why investors will pay close attention to the earnings report from D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) the largest home builder in the U.S. The report is scheduled to be released on July 18.\n\nIn early July, investors got the latest housing data. Building permits and housing starts were down YOY in May. That suggests that home builders like D.R. Horton may guide for lower revenue and earnings when they report.\n\nTight supply and high demand, particularly for first-time home buyers, should be bullish for home builders. And D.R. Horton has been beating analysts\u2019 estimates for revenue and earnings with levels well above 2019 levels. But the numbers are still coming in lower YOY. That reflects the frustration of a housing market that\u2019s navigating inflation and interest rates on both ends of the market.\n\nSLB (SLB) A zoomed in image of the logo for \"Schlumberger\" reflecting light on a smooth tan stone tiled wall.\n\nSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSLB (NYSE:SLB) is the oilfield services provider formerly known as (and still frequently referred to) as Schlumberger. Despite the fact that oil prices are higher YOY, the energy sector has been underperforming the market.\u00a0SLB has been no different. It\u2019s down 12% for the year.\n\nBut energy prices have been holding steady above $80 a barrel. And if the Fed lowers interest rates as expected, it\u2019s likely to increase demand. And with oil production already near record highs, there will be no incentive for oil companies to decrease production.\n\nThe bullish argument for SLB comes from the company\u2019s technology which is likely to add operational efficiencies to the drilling process. Furthermore, most of the company\u2019s final investment decisions have a breakeven point with oil at $50 a barrel.\n\nInvestors won\u2019t have long to wait. SLB is reporting on July 19 making it one of the first companies to report earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: MicroStrategy Is Next",
        "content": "The stock market has seen plenty of stock splits in 2024. Driven higher chiefly by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom and slower inflation trends, several high-priced stocks have been sliced into a larger number of smaller shares.\n\nExamples of big-name announcements so far include a 10-for-1 split of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares in early June, a 50-for-1 split in Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) two weeks later, and Broadcom's (NASDAQ: AVGO) 10-for-1 split over this very weekend. This was Nvidia's second split since 2006. In contrast, the other two industry titans had never resliced their shares before.\n\nNone of these stock splits added or burned any real value for shareholders. The splits merely rearranged the same total market value into a larger number of shares, reducing the price per share and making the stock more accessible.\n\nNext in line: MicroStrategy\n\nSo who's next in line for a stock split? As it turns out, the winning name is business intelligence specialist MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). The board of directors decided on a 10-for-1 stock split earlier this week, to be executed after the closing bell on Thursday, Aug. 1.\r\n\r\nThe company hadn't executed a split since a 1-for-10 reverse split to prop up a fading stock price in 2002. Founder and chairman Michael Saylor's all-in bet on Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) as an alternative to cash reserves has worked wonders so far. The stock is up more than 225% over the last 52 weeks and 1,060% in four years, driven by smaller gains in Bitcoin's price per coin. These days, MicroStrategy stock is changing hands for the princely sum of $1,310 per share.\n\nAnd MicroStrategy has evolved into a pretty direct bet on Bitcoin in recent years. Is it time to slice MicroStrategy's stock differently? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicroStrategy's recent financial maneuvers\n\nMicroStrategy's stock chart and financial activities in 2024 sent strong hints of a possible stock split.\n\nFor example, MicroStrategy recently completed an $800 million offering of 2.25% convertible senior notes due in 2032. The notes are convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both. Notably, the initial conversion price is approximately $2,043.32 per share, a 35% premium over the stock's average price on June 13. This premium indicates strong investor confidence in MicroStrategy's stock performance.\n\nAdditionally, the stock has been floating higher on Saylor's Bitcoin strategy. At the end of March, the company held approximately 214,300 Bitcoins with a market value of $15.2 billion. The company has consistently added to its Bitcoin holdings, financed by cash flows from the software business, stock sales, and fresh debt papers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMichael Saylor's company raised over $1.5 billion in the first quarter alone through convertible debt offerings, using that cash to acquire 25,250 additional Bitcoins. MicroStrategy also raised $800 million in new debt on June 18, aiming to purchase some more Bitcoin with the proceeds.\n\nAmid this bustling Bitcoin-buying action, the cryptocurrency's price has increased more than 90% over the last year. Most market watchers (myself included) expect the Bitcoin gains to continue in the second half of 2024 and next year, powered by the predictable patterns of Bitcoin's halving cycles and the recent addition of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on real-time Bitcoin prices. If that theory plays out as expected, MicroStrategy's stock should also see even higher stock prices over the same period.\n\nWhy a stock split makes sense for MicroStrategy\n\nGiven MicroStrategy's soaring stock price and Saylor's daring financial strategies, the announced 10-for-1 stock split makes MicroStrategy shares more accessible to a broader range of investors. Currently trading just over $1,300 per share, the stock's high price can be a barrier of entry for smaller investors -- especially if they are unaware of or uncomfortable with buying fractional shares of high-priced stocks. Low-budget investors will find it easier to reach for a stock priced around $130 per share.\n\nSo MicroStrategy's strategic financial maneuvers, strong Bitcoin holdings, and high stock price create an ideal environment for a stock split. Now that the split is coming soon, investors should still keep a close watch on this tech veteran and crypto maven. Only time will tell how the Bitcoin-centric strategy will work out in the long run, but it's certainly off to a good start.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Value Stocks Set for Stratospheric Returns",
        "content": "Even as the S&P 500 reaches new highs, some investors are fleeing to value stocks as their best option for long-term growth. Growing Concerns about the investment concentration in growth indices create cause for concern, as in the S&P 500\u2019s increased reliance on high-flying tech stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to keep the party going. This reliance is a double-edged sword; a few missteps by these companies could crush your portfolio.\n\nToday\u2019s value stocks offer two key advantages: the best ones largely adapted to economic conditions, with relative undervaluation creating massive upside as winds shift, and their inherent value characteristics help preserve capital. This often translates to solid income and dividend opportunities.\n\nThese value stocks combine these strengths, making them one of the best strategies to diversify risk away from the dominant stocks that largely control your portfolio\u2019s performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPolaris (PII) A close-up shot of a Polaris (PII) all terrain vehicle.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nOff-road and adventure enthusiasts rejoice \u2014 Polaris (NYSE:PII) is one of those value stocks that may have suffered in recent months amid higher rates and reduced economic performance but is set to surge forces realign to improve its market standing.\n\nPolaris makes a range of off-road vehicles, including ATVs, side-by-sides, and even snowmobiles. Sales surged mid-pandemic as cheap debt made financing easy and abundant free time amid shutdowns forced outdoor recreation. That all changed, of course, and income dipped drastically between 2022 and 2023\u2019s end as rate hikes took full effect.\n\nBut Polaris is set for an upsurge that will delineate the company from other value stocks, as renewed consumer sentiment and softening inflation increase the likelihood of rate cuts. Already, industry experts expect a solid 8% combined annual growth rate for the wider off-road recreation segment through 2032. Likewise, Polaris is undeniably dominant in the category, enjoying a brand position well above competitors that ultimately sets it up for a solid resurgence in the coming years.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) An image of construction workers on a building construction site.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSmall-cap agriculture and construction equipment stock Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) may not have the widespread recognition of industry giants like Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but its strong fundamentals are hard to ignore. Titan Machinery\u2019s recent first-quarter report blew past analyst expectations, posting a 10% year-over-year sales increase, although net income dropped, largely due to challenges like rising supply chain and fuel costs. But, as with value stocks like Polaris, improved economic outlooks bode well for a rapid reversal in Titan\u2019s fortune.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo that end, Titan Machinery is undeniably undervalued, considering its potential upside, trading at just 0.12x sales, 3.66x earnings, and 0.52x book value. Undervaluation this dramatic is particularly stark considering the company\u2019s 79% annualized income growth over the past three years, even accounting for recent declines. For the remainder of the year, Titan\u2019s conservative outlook includes single-digit gain projections across all operational segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings. However, if Titan surpasses these modest forecasts, the stock could rapidly reverse from its recent downward trajectory. Either way, Titan\u2019s low cost among value stocks makes it an undeniably solid play at these prices.\n\nSteelcase (SCS) Furnished office\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHigh-end office furniture manufacturer Steelcase (NYSE:SCS) will benefit from the same economic tailwinds propelling the other value stocks on the list but also has the secondary boost of capturing wider work-from-home trends that create new market opportunities.\n\nAfter pandemic-related setbacks, Steelcase swiftly regained financial stability. The company\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report revealed a net income of $10.9 million, nearly 10x year-over-year, further proving that economic conditions are improving in Steelcase\u2019s favor. Additionally, steady sales of approximately $3.2 billion over the past two years highlight Steelcase\u2019s ability to maintain strong margins without sacrificing quality.\n\nTo capitalize on the ongoing remote work shift, Steelcase targets 4-6% annual sales growth and aims for a 5% free cash flow margin as a percentage of revenue over the next five years. The company has also significantly reduced its debt, enhancing liquidity and lowering interest costs in the current high-interest-rate environment. These strategic initiatives position Steelcase as a top player among quality value stocks in today\u2019s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Apple: Consider These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has a long history of providing consistent stock gains. Its shares are up 346% in the last five years alone, outperforming many of its peers and the S&P 500's 86% rise. The company is the king of consumer tech, profiting from the immense brand loyalty it has built.\n\nHowever, Apple has hit many hurdles over the past year. The company got a late start in artificial intelligence (AI), which left it out of much of the rally the market has seen since the beginning of 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, repeated declines in sales have forced the company to rethink its product strategy. It has the cash and brand dominance to turn things around over the long term, but it might be worth investing in more reliable stocks for now. NVDA Chart\n\nThis table shows Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have delivered significantly more returns than Apple since the start of 2024. They have rallied investors with dominating roles in crucial areas of AI: chip design and cloud computing. The two leaders in their respective industries are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon.\n\nTheir more established positions in tech indicate they could offer more share increases over the next decade than the iPhone maker. So, forget Apple and consider buying these two millionaire-maker stocks instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nFew stocks have been watched as closely as Nvidia has over the last year. The company has achieved rock-star status in the tech industry as its chips have become the gold standard for AI developers worldwide. Nvidia is responsible for an estimated 90% of the AI chip market thanks to the success of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nMuch as Apple has attracted loyal users with its easy-to-use design language, Nvidia's Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a leading reason for its AI dominance. CUDA is the software platform that complements the company's AI GPUs. Millions of developers have grown so accustomed to Nvidia's chip architecture that switching to similar offerings from competitors like AMD makes little sense. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs demand for AI services has soared, so has Nvidia's sales. The chart above shows the significant difference in financial growth that Nvidia has seen over AMD since last July. As a result, Nvidia hit $39 billion in free cash flow this year, while AMD hovered around $1 billion in free cash flow.\n\nNvidia's higher figure suggests it's only widening the gap between the companies, with it potentially being better equipped to keep investing in its technology and maintain its lead.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached $196 billion in spending last year and is growing at a rate that would see it hit close to $2 trillion by 2030. So, despite its meteoric rise since last year, the AI market still has plenty of room to run, with Nvidia well-positioned to keep seeing major gains and creating millionaires.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has made more than a few millionaires over the years. Since its initial public offering in 1997, the company's stock has soared over 200,000%.\n\nIt has gone from an online book retailer to the biggest name in e-commerce in multiple countries. And as its earnings have grown, Amazon has reinvested in its business, diversifying its revenue streams to include income from cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more.\n\nThe company posted its first-quarter earnings on April 30, delivering revenue growth of 13% year over year and beating Wall Street estimates by $750 million. Amazon proved its e-commerce business remains lucrative, with revenue rising 10% and 12% in its two retail segments. Meanwhile, retail operating income reached a collective $6 billion after reporting losses of $349 million the year before.\n\nBut it's outside of e-commerce where the company's greatest promise can be found. Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), dominates the market, reporting revenue growth of 17% year over year and operating income that nearly doubled. The quarter also highlighted the company's budding digital ad business, with revenue in its advertising services segment rising 24% after introducing ads on Prime Video.\n\nWhile Apple has suffered several quarters of sales declines, Amazon has seen an impressive boost to revenue in its retail segments. Meanwhile, it has become an imposing figure in AI thanks to AWS. With growth catalysts in multiple markets, its stock is too good to ignore right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Hot Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 2024 Edition",
        "content": "The markets have soared in the last six months, with a handful of hot stocks leading the charge. Equity benchmarks like the S&P 500 are charting new territories fueled by macroeconomic factors. In the first six months of the year, the index is up by an impressive 17.50%, recording new all-time highs 34 times this year.\n\nLooking at the statistics, it is tempting to assume that this momentum will lead the market to a strong finish this year. But if we\u2019re being honest, there are two ways this can play out. The bullish view is that companies continue to experience unprecedented gains in the latter half of the year. The bearish take is that we\u2019re in a bubble and headed for a market correction.\n\nHowever, one factor remains a certainty regardless of how this unfolds. Fundamentally strong companies will remain good long-term plays despite market conditions. That is, stocks are well-positioned to weather the ups and downs of the financial market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn this premise, I\u2019ve rounded up three hot stocks that are good buys today and show significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation logo on smartphone screen. Against stock prices, stock chart. Investments in securities.. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is among the hot stocks on the market right now, with shares up 161% this year. Given its strong run, one could argue that NVDA is overvalued and headed for a correction. While this is a possibility, the company gives investors plenty of reasons to remain optimistic about its long-term performance.\n\nOne particular tailwind that sticks out is the pace of its chip development. During a recent conference, Nvidia\u2019s leather-clad CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that chip production is on a \u201cone-year rhythm.\u201d Put simply, the company will now launch AI chips once a year and not once every two years. That\u2019s an impressive feat, given that Nvidia\u2019s chips are incredibly advanced and offer diverse utility.\n\nThe financials reflect its growth potential. In the last quarter, Nvidia reported $26 billion in revenue, up 262% from a year ago. It anticipates a 2% increase in the next quarter. Given its impressive performance, NVDA stock is trading at a premium, but its growth potential makes it a worthy investment.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is another stock with massive upside potential. Shares of the company are experiencing a strong run this year, with SPOT stock up 99.3% in the last twelve months. While the gains are impressive, Spotify is poised for higher gains as it explores additional revenue streams to improve profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter a stellar Q1 that saw subscribers grow by 14%, the company dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of monetization.\u201d This monetization will be fueled by several enhancements across the platform to provide users with more value for their money. In its efforts to action these changes, Spotify announced a price hike in its core and premium subscription plans.\n\nIn the upcoming quarter, the company hopes to add 16 million new monthly users (MAU) and anticipates a 28.1% improvement in gross margin. Combining operational efficiencies, pricing strategies and expansion into additional revenue streams will help drive this growth.\n\nIn short, SPOT stock is at the top of its game now, but several signs point to even greater growth. Hot stocks like this one are ideal for investors seeking long-term plays.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe shift to a cashless society and the rise in consumer spending have been boons for Mastercard (NYSE:MA). The company offers electronic and contactless payment methods services to several parties, including financial institutions, businesses, governments and private account holders. With its stock up 13.8% in the last 12 months, Mastercard aims to enhance its offerings to sustain its growth.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials reflect its success story. In the last quarter, net revenue rose by 10% year-over-year (YoY) to $6.3 billion. Cross-border volume growth was up by 18% due to strong consumer spending and deal wins across all regions. The performance underscores Mastercard\u2019s strong market position and ability to adapt to an evolving payment landscape.\n\nLooking ahead, Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra outlined several growth opportunities that it plans to capitalize on. This includes adding value to its international and domestic money-moving capabilities with Mastercard Move, which will increase the efficiency of its transactions. It also focuses strongly on supporting the customer beyond the transaction while leaning into the digital payment trend. These tailwinds will help Mastercard capture a higher market share as it competes with Visa (NYSE:V) for more customers.\n\nTrading slightly below its all-time high of $490, MA is one of the hot stocks on the market right now. With several growth opportunities in the pipeline, investors can look forward to outsized gains from this payment company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "content": "On Wall Street, there's always a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend vying for the attention of professional and everyday investors. Since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, investors have been eagerly awaiting the next game-changing innovation that would alter the growth arc for corporate America. After numerous buzzy trends have come and gone, artificial intelligence (AI) aims to give the proliferation of the internet a run for its money.\n\nWith AI, tasks that would normally be overseen or undertaken by humans are instead handled by AI-driven software and systems. The catalyst that gives AI almost limitless potential is the ability for software and systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention. By 2030, the analysts at PwC estimate that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy.\n\nAlthough AI stocks have been making most billionaire money managers and investment funds notably richer throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024, not everyone has come along for the ride. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoftBank's $160 billion \"boo-boo\" with Nvidia\n\nIn May 2017, SoftBankGroup(OTC: SFTB.Y)(OTC: SFTBF) unveiled a sizable investment -- a 4.9% stake -- in graphics processing unit (GPU) provider Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) via its then-newly launched Vision Fund.\n\nSoftBank's Vision Fund had roughly $90 billion in available capital following its launch and aimed to put money to work in the AI technology ecosystem. Keep in mind that this \"ecosystem\" extends well beyond the hardware that Nvidia now makes, and can include the infrastructure and software supporting next-gen AI advancements.\n\nBetween the time SoftBank's Vision Fund made its initial investment in Nvidia and the start of October 2018, Nvidia's stock effectively tripled in value. Rapidly evolving interest in cryptocurrencies made Nvidia's GPUs a hot commodity for crypto miners looking to earn a profit.\n\nBut when the crypto bear market arrived, interest in Nvidia's GPUs quickly evaporated from cryptocurrency miners. By early 2019, SoftBank's Vision Fund had sold its position in Nvidia and banked a healthy profit of more than $3 billion.\n\nAlthough nobody's ever gone broke taking a profit, hindsight isn't always pretty on Wall Street.\n\nAs most readers are probably aware, Nvidia's H100 GPU in 2023 quickly became the de facto choice by businesses looking to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers. Last year, Nvidia was responsible for an estimated 98% of the 3.85 million AI GPUs that were shipped, according to TechInsights.\n\nStory continues\n\nAside from its first-mover advantage in AI-accelerated data centers, Nvidia also benefited from demand for its hardware handily outstripping supply. The beauty of this scenario is that it allowed the company to substantially increase the price of its GPUs, which ultimately pushed its adjusted gross margin to 78.4% during the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nIn just a little over 18 months, Nvidia has gained close to $3 trillion in market value. If SoftBank's Vision Fund had the wherewithal (and stomach) to hold on to its original investment in Nvidia, it would be worth nearly $163 billion, as of the closing bell on July 10.\n\nThough SoftBank \"banked\" around a $3 billion profit on its previous stake in Nvidia, it ultimately missed out on $160 billion in additional capital gains. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSoftBank's Nvidia overhang is likely to be short-lived\n\nWhile SoftBank's management team and investment gurus can dream of what could have been with Nvidia, there are two reasons the company will likely get over this missed opportunity sooner than later.\n\nThe first panacea for SoftBank is that history suggests Nvidia is in a sizable bubble. Since the internet became relevant in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a single next-big-thing investment trend that's avoided an early-stage bubble.\n\nPut another way, investors have, without fail, consistently overestimated how quickly businesses or consumers would adopt a new technology or trend. If artificial intelligence follows this same trajectory and needs time to mature as a technology, arguably no company would face more potential downside than Nvidia.\n\nTo add to this point, most businesses really don't have a clue how they're going to deploy AI solutions to improve their sales and profits. While many industry leaders are investing in the necessary hardware to run high-compute data centers, most lack a well-defined blueprint for how it's going to improve their operations.\n\nAdditionally, competition is coming at Nvidia from all angles. On top of contending with external competitors entering the scene, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI GPUs for their data centers. Even if Nvidia's chips retain their compute advantage, a lessening of AI GPU scarcity, coupled with less space in data centers for Nvidia's hardware, would reduce its pricing power and, ultimately, its adjusted gross margin.\n\nThree years from now, SoftBank's Nvidia boo-boo is liable to be a lot smaller.\n\nThe second reason SoftBank is unlikely to dwell on its (in hindsight) early sale of Nvidia stock is the outperformance of intellectual property (IP)-driven semiconductor company Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM) since going public last year.\n\nArm isn't responsible for making the hardware used in enterprise data centers. Rather, semiconductor Goliaths pay Arm royalties and/or licensing fees to use its central processing unit, GPU, and various IP system designs. This is a high-margin operating model that puts Arm right at the heart of the AI revolution.\n\nIn August 2023, just a month prior to Arm's initial public offering (IPO) at $51 per share, SoftBank Group acquired the final 25% of Arm that it didn't already own. At the time, this valued Arm Holdings at $64 billion.\n\nFollowing Arm's IPO, SoftBank retained 90% of the company's outstanding shares. With demand for AI GPUs rocketing into the stratosphere, Arm's growth forecasts have impressed Wall Street and investors. As of the closing bell on July 10, SoftBank's roughly 90% stake had ballooned in value to almost $176 billion. In just 10 months, SoftBank has seen its investment appreciate by $112 billion!\n\nSo although SoftBank undeniably missed with Nvidia, it's hit its investment in Arm Holdings out of the park.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Finally Time to Sell Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the hottest stocks on the market since the beginning of 2023, clocking stunning gains of 799% and outpacing the S&P 500 index's 45% jump by a massive margin. This was due to the impressive growth in the company's revenue and earnings due to the healthy demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nThis phenomenal surge is why Nvidia is now trading at a rich valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 77 is well above the Nasdaq 100 index's multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). This is why some Wall Street analysts are now concerned about the company's ability to sustain its red-hot rally.\n\nNew Street Research recently downgraded Nvidia from buy to neutral, citing the stock's valuation. Analyst Pierre Ferragu has a one-year price target of $135 on the stock, which points toward a very limited upside from current levels. Meanwhile, the stock's median one-year price target of $130, as per 62 analysts covering the stock, also indicates that it's unlikely to deliver more gains.\n\nDoes this mean it's now time for investors to book their profits and sell Nvidia stock?\n\nCan Nvidia continue to outperform the market's expectations?\n\nNew Street Research believes that Nvidia stock could deliver more gains only if there's a sizable increase in its outlook beyond 2025. It's analysts aren't convinced that this scenario is going to materialize just yet. The combination of Nvidia's rich valuation and concerns about sustaining its terrific growth next year seems to have dented confidence in the company.\n\nBut a closer look at the potential growth of the AI chip market, which Nvidia dominates, and the company's robust pricing power suggest it could indeed sustain healthy growth in 2025 and beyond. Market research firm TechNavio is forecasting the AI chip market will see\u00a0 an incredible annual growth rate of 68% through 2028, adding $390 billion in incremental revenue.\n\nWith an estimated 94% share of this market, Nvidia remains in a terrific position to capitalize on this opportunity. Of course, there's competition from the likes of AMD and Intel in the AI chip market, but Nvidia is expected to remain the dominant player. For example, Citigroup expects Nvidia to control between 90% and 95% of the AI chip market in 2024 and 2025.\n\nOne reason that may be the case is because of the Nvidia's ability to command a technology lead over rivals. Its next-generation Blackwell AI chips are already in full production, as management said on the latest earnings conference call. It also pointed out that the demand for Blackwell is \"well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's worth noting that Nvidia's Blackwell chips are manufactured on a 4-nanometer (nm) node. For comparison, AMD's flagship MI300X AI accelerator is reportedly manufactured on a 5nm and 6nm process. The smaller process node allows Nvidia to pack in more transistors, making its chips more powerful and energy efficient.\n\nMore specifically, the Blackwell chips pack 208 billion transistors, as compared to 153 billion transistors on the MI300X. This explains why the demand for Nvidia's new processors exceeds supply. Moreover, even if Nvidia were to lose ground in the AI chip market in the future, its data center revenue is expected to multiply significantly, thanks to the massive addressable opportunity present in this space.\n\nAll this explains why Nvidia's revenue estimates have been heading higher consistently of late. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMoreover, analysts are estimating Nvidia's earnings to increase at an annual rate of 43% for the next five years. Based on its earnings of $1.19 per share in fiscal 2024, the company's bottom line could jump to $7.11 after five years. Multiply that with the Nasdaq 100's forward earnings multiple of 29.5 and Nvidia's stock price could increase to $210, implying a 60% upside from current levels.\n\nIt may not be a good idea to sell shares of Nvidia right now, and a closer look at the company's valuation indicates it isn't really expensive when considering the growth that the stock is expected to deliver.\n\nThe chipmaker's valuation is justified\n\nWhile it's true that Nvidia stock is expensive right now when compared to the broader index, it would be wrong to take a look at its valuation in isolation. The company delivered a 262% year-over-year increase in revenue in fiscal Q1 to a record $26 billion, along with a 461% increase in adjusted earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 index's earnings grew an estimated 7.1% in the first quarter of the calendar year.\n\nAs it turns out, Nvidia's rapid earnings growth is why its P/E has dropped in the past year, signifying that it's been able to justify the premium valuation. NVDA PE Ratio Chart\n\nThe company's forward P/E ratio of 48 isn't very expensive considering that the U.S. technology sector has a similar earnings multiple. So selling Nvidia stock based on its valuation doesn't look like a good idea. The terrific growth that it's been delivering and its ability to sustain it could result in more upside in the long run.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "title": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar By as Much as 100%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "Stock splits are all the rage on Wall Street this year, as evidenced by the growing number of companies engaging in them. These maneuvers are usually only undertaken after years of strong financial and operating results have driven a company's stock price out of reach of some smaller investors. It's worth noting that while a stock split is merely a cosmetic change, it can make it easier for employees and other retail investors to buy shares, which is often the reason cited by management for performing one.\n\nMore important to investors, however, should be the results that precede a split. In general, strong businesses tend to continue their winning ways, providing investors with an ongoing incentive to buy the stocks. So let's take a look at three companies that have more upside ahead, according to select Wall Street analysts. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia: Highest price-target upside, 56%\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has long been the undisputed champion of the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering video games, cloud computing, and data centers. As a result, it was well positioned when generative artificial intelligence (AI) burst on the scene in early 2023 and propelled demand for its highest-end chips into the stratosphere.\n\nNvidia's GPUs can provide the computational horsepower necessary to train and run large and complex large language models and other AI systems -- and their sales are booming.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 first quarter (which ended April 28), Nvidia's revenue jumped 262% year over year to a record $26 billion, propelling its earnings per share (EPS) up 629% to $5.98. Chips used for AI had the biggest impact: Revenue from its data center segment -- which includes AI processors -- jumped by 427% to $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia's recent 10-for-1 stock split has captivated the imagination of investors. Even after the stock has gained more than 200% over the past year (as of this writing), some on Wall Street remain incredibly upbeat. Among the Wall Street analysts covering the stock, Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann is the company's biggest bull, with a buy rating and $200 price target, which would amount to upside of 56% from Monday's closing price.\n\nThe analyst cites accelerating demand for AI chips and Nvidia's integrated software, which fuels its top-shelf performance. \"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix, with an upward bias to valuation due to sustainability,\" Mosesmann wrote. This suggests that Nvidia's market cap will climb from its current level around $3 trillion to $5 trillion over the next year or so.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe's far from alone in his bullishness on Nvidia. Of the 57 analysts who offered an opinion on the stock in June, 53 rated the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommended selling.\n\nCelsius Holdings: Highest price-target upside, 75%\n\nCelsius Holdings' (NASDAQ: CELH) approach to energy drinks focuses on healthier alternatives, and it is carving out market share in a fast-growing and profitable niche. It has quickly ascended the ranks to become the third-largest energy drink brand and conducted a 3-for-1 stock split late last year following a long period of robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, while rivals Red Bull and Monster Beverage have struggled, Celsius has been stealing share -- it nabbed 47% of all growth in the energy drink category in the first quarter. Notably, over the past three years, even as the broader beverage industry has contracted, the energy drink category has continued to grow -- and Celsius has been driving that trend.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue grew 37% year over year to $356 million, while diluted EPS soared by 108%. Celsius faces tougher comps this year as its sales more than doubled in 2023, the result of its partnership with PepsiCo. The beverage giant made a $550 million investment for an 8.5% stake in Celsius, and supercharged its distribution.\n\nOver the past month, the stock has shed 23% of its value on concerns about slowing growth. However, some on Wall Street view this slump as a buying opportunity. Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala maintains a buy rating and a $98 price target on the stock -- 75% higher than Monday's closing price. The analyst noted the slower growth is \"normal in year two of [a] national distribution\" agreement and recommends that investors disregard the \"near-term noise.\"\n\nSirius XM Holdings: Highest price-target upside, 100%\n\nSirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI) is the undisputed satellite radio leader in North America. It boasts 34 million paid subscribers and 150 million total listeners when including its ad-supported Pandora music streaming service -- an audience that's unmatched.\n\nThe macroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years, including higher-than-usual inflation, have weighed on the stock, which is down 41% thus far in 2024. Furthermore, investors are having an unjustified knee-jerk reaction to Sirius XM's upcoming third-quarter merger with Liberty Sirius XM(NASDAQ: LSXMA), its tracking stock, and the resulting reverse stock split. While a reverse stock split is typically a sign of trouble, in this case, it's a necessary corporate action as part of the upcoming acquisition, which will bring all its shareholders under one \"roof.\"\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue climbed 1% year over year to $2.16 billion, while EPS jumped 17% to $0.07. Its improving metrics were fueled by record ad revenue, the result of an ongoing recovery in the broader advertising space. While its paid subscribership declined by nearly 2%, the impact of that was partially offset by an increase in average revenue per subscriber.\n\nIn the wake of the stock's 27% decline over the past year, some on Wall Street believe the selloff has gone too far. Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan leads the bull camp on Sirius XM, with a buy rating and a price target of $6.50 on the stock. That's 100% higher than Monday's closing price. Harrigan points to a market disconnect in advance of its upcoming merger with Liberty Sirius XM, as well as a \"gaggle of strategic initiatives\" undertaken by management as having the potential to drive growth.\n\nThis uncertainty has led to a similar disconnect between the business and its valuation. Sirius XM currently trades for less than 10 times earnings, a ratio that suggests almost no growth ahead. Yet the improving U.S. economy should boost Sirius XM's growth rate, which could act as a catalyst for a stock price rally.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) ended the recent trading session at $129.28, demonstrating a +1.47% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.55% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.62%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.63%.\n\nThe maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence's stock has dropped by 1.71% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.73% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.28%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Nvidia in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.63, indicating a 133.33% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $28.24 billion, up 109.04% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $2.68 per share and a revenue of $117.55 billion, indicating changes of +106.15% and +92.95%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.24% increase. Nvidia is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 47.52. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 31.56.\n\nWe can also see that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.26. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As the market closed yesterday, the Semiconductor - General industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.64.\n\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 103, which puts it in the top 41% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "SoundHound AI Stock May Be Poised for a Correction. Be Careful.",
        "content": "There\u2019s a great deal to like about Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock at this point. Its exposure to the AI megatrend, alliance with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and strong, overall growth are all in its favor.\n\nHowever, given the stock\u2019s recent, overdone rally, along with the name\u2019s extremely high valuation and significant competition, I recommend that investors hold the shares but avoid buying them.\n\nSoundhound AI Stock\u2019s Many Positive Attributes\n\nSoundhound, which produces an AI-powered voice assistant used by businesses, is benefiting from being part of the AI megatrend that is being embraced by investors and many companies. Partly as a result of this situation, Soundhound AI stock soared 157% between the beginning of the year and the afternoon of July 11.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fact many companies seek to save money by implementing AI-powered tools likely helped Soundhound successfully convince many to adopt its offerings. That is a huge factor behind Soundhound\u2019s impressive growth. Last quarter, the firm\u2019s top line surged 73% versus the same period a year earlier to $11.6 million while its cumulative subscriptions & bookings backlog soared about 80% year-over-year to a very impressive $682 million.\n\nFinally, Soundhound\u2019s alliance with Nvidia boosted SoundhoundAI stock while also lifting financial results. In February, the chip giant disclosed that it purchased almost $3.7 million of Soundhound AI stock. The information undoubtedly lit a fire under Soundhound\u2019s shares, as its stock surged from $2.26 on Feb. 14, the day before the news was disclosed, to $8.24 on March 18. Although the shares subsequently sharply retreated, Nvidia\u2019s investment in Soundhound has put the latter company on many investors\u2019 radar and made them excited about its outlook.\n\nAlso importantly, the company\u2019s association with Nvidia has undoubtedly helped it obtain more customers since firms are likely impressed by the investment.\n\nAfterall, Soundhound\u2019s list of customers is impressive. Among them are Applebee\u2019s, Church\u2019s Chicken, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA),Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMLY).\n\nA Potentially Overdone Rally\n\nOn July 10, SoundHound announced Stellantis began including \u201cits\u00a0SoundHound Chat AI\u00a0voice assistant with integrated ChatGPT\u201d in its \u201cPeugeot, Opel and Vauxhall vehicle brands across 11 European markets.\u201d The news sparked a huge rally in SoundHound AI stock.\n\nNot surprisingly, SoundHound did not reveal the financial terms of the deal. But as a longtime investor in BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), I know the royalties software makers obtain from auto companies can be quite low. For example, BlackBerry historically only received $1.50 to $5 per vehicle for its infotainment offering. It also received as little as $5 per vehicle for its more advanced technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s more, SoundHound began providing voice AI systems for Stellantis last year. That means this new deal may not produce large revenue increases for the tech firm.\n\nValuation and Competition\n\nBy any measure, the valuation of Soundhound AI stock is quite elevated. The shares have a forward price-to-sales ratio of over 17 times. Its enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is a gigantic 30.5 times.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the company reportedly has many competitors. Amomg them are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\u00a0Further, a company called Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) is said to have taken automotive customers away from Soundhound in the past.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SoundHound AI Stock\n\nI believe that SoundhoundAI has a bright future. However, given the company\u2019s high valuation, its many tough competitors and the market\u2019s exuberance about its deal with Stellantis, I expect the shares to drop significantly below their current levels in the medium term.\n\nSuch a downturn could occur because Soundhound reports weaker-than-expected quarterly results or because it loses a key customer. Alternatively, a correction by the stock market could cause the company\u2019s share price to drop sharply.\n\nConsequently, I recommend investors wait for a meaningful pullback before pulling the trigger rather than chasing it in the wake of its recent rally. However, investors who already own the shares should hold onto them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in BB.

        "title": "ETFs That Gained on Mag 7's Worst Day in a Year",
        "content": "Big Tech got thrashed on Thursday with bellwethers like NVIDIA NVDA down more than 5%, while the entire \"Magnificent 7\" group of stocks, which consists of Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, NVIDIA and Tesla, had its worst day in nearly a year, according to Yahoo Finance. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped almost 2%.\n\nTesla TSLA shares snapped an 11-day winning streak to decline more than 8% on its worst day since January after a Bloomberg report revealed that the EV maker Tesla may delay the launch of its \u201crobotaxi.\u201d Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS was off 4.5% on Jul 11.\n\nConsumer Inflation on a Downhill Ride\n\nMeanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dipped 0.1% sequentially in June and increased just 3.0% year over year. The annual gain marked the slowest rise in consumer prices since early 2021. U.S. inflation, in fact, cooled for the third straight month.\n\nThis triggered talks that the Fed may cut rates sooner than expected. This week Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the favorable economic conditions may help the Fed to start enacting interest-rate cuts. Thursday's inflation print cemented bets on a cut by September, with around 90% of traders expecting such an outcome, according to CME FedWatch.\n\nRate-Sensitive Sector ETFs Gaining From 'Mag 7' Slump\n\nAs chances of rate cuts strengthened, investors started to bet big on rate-sensitive sectors like Real Estate, which can be marked as Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF Shares VNQ, and Utilities, as replicated by Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund XLU, following June's cooler-than-expected inflation print. Both VNQ and XLU were up 2.8% and 1.7%, respectively, on Jul 11. Housing ETFs like iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB also surged as much as 6.3% on the day.\n\nInvestors should note that these sectors are rate-sensitive and perform better in a falling-rate environment. Moreover, these sectors are known for paying handsome yields, which is a key requirement in a low-rate environment.\n\nDow Jones: A Potential Gainer?\n\nInvestors should note that if the Fed cuts rates soon, the yield curve may steepen. As banks seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, a steepening yield curve earns more on lending and pays less on deposits, thereby leading to a wider spread. This expands net margins and increases banks\u2019 profits (read: How Will Bank ETFs Perform in Light of Q2 Earnings?).\n\nNow, the Dow Jones has about 23% exposure to the financials stocks and thus is expected to fare better ahead. Moreover, the Dow Jones has 13.70% exposure to Industrials stocks \u2014 another area that is expected to benefit from low rates. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA) added 0.09% on Jul 11.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Lies Ahead for Magnificent 7?\n\nAlthough Magnificent 7 suffered badly on Thursday, we expect the segment to recover in the coming days as a low-rate environment is beneficial for high-growth tech stocks too. While there is a debate if NVIDIA is an overvalued stock after recording 164% gains this year and trailing the 12-month P/E of 74.95X (versus the semiconductor industry P/E of 26.53X), not all members of Mag 7 are overvalued. They may see a stellar run ahead thanks to their artificial intelligence initiatives.\n\nAnd we all know that the AI boom is here stay now. Hence, investors with a strong stomach for risks may buy the dip in Mag 7 with the Mag 7-heavy ETFs like MAGS and InvescoS&P 500 Top 50 ETF XLG.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Nvidia Highlights Lucrative Returns For Cloud Providers Using Nvidia GPUs\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is on a roll thanks to the artificial intelligence frenzy. In June 2024, Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company, reaching a valuation of $3.34 trillion.\n\nDuring the Bank of America Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference, Ian Buck, Vice President and General Manager of Nvidia's hyperscale and HPC business, highlighted the financial benefits of investing in GPUs, the First Post reports.\n\nAlso Read: Taiwan Semiconductor Joins The Trillion Dollar Club, Surpassing Tesla: Report\n\nHe mentioned that cloud providers see substantial returns on investment with Nvidia's GPUs. Over four years, providers can generate five dollars for every dollar spent on GPUs.\n\nBuck pointed out that inferencing tasks are even more profitable, with a seven-dollar return for each dollar invested in the same period, and this figure is on the rise.\n\nNvidia is actively addressing the growing demand for AI inference with products like Nvidia Inference Microservices (NIMs), which support popular AI models such as Llama, Mistral, and Gemma. The company is also focusing on its new Blackwell GPU.\n\nBuck emphasized the necessity of early collaboration, noting the significant planning required for data center construction projects.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Nvidia through Vanguard Information Tech ETF (NYSE:VGT) and iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded higher by 2.35% at $130.39 at the last check on Friday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAMD Challenges Nvidia With Strategic $665M Purchase Of Finnish AI Lab\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Nvidia Highlights Lucrative Returns For Cloud Providers Using Nvidia GPUs originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Chip Stock Face-Off: A 10-Year Forecast for NVDA, MU and AMD",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry has been soaring, with chip stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) soaring to nosebleed valuations amid the surging hype around artificial intelligence technology.\n\nSome people have seen this story play out before. Remember the dot-com bubble? While I\u2019m as excited as anyone about AI\u2019s transformative potential, I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019re due for a reality check.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I still believe in these companies\u2019 long-term prospects. But it\u2019s hard not to feel a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The chip market has always been cyclical, and predicting its future means betting on the staying power of the AI revolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWill the current AI frenzy fizzle out like the early internet did, leaving overeager investors holding the bag? Or will this prove to be a true paradigm shift with room for multiple winners? It\u2019s hard to tell unless we dig deeper. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Nvidia to stratospheric heights, with the stock recently hitting an all-time high of $135 (post-split). Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm is palpable. Analysts are falling over themselves to raise price targets, with some projecting NVDA stock could go as high as $200 per share.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results were jaw-dropping, with revenue up 262% year-over-year to $26 billion. The company is riding massive tailwinds in AI, data centers, and gaming. Its GPUs are the gold standard for training large language models. And with the company\u2019s new Blackwell architecture on the horizon, Nvidia seems poised to maintain its technological edge. Its Compute & Networking segment has been booming. Chip stocks comparison: NVDA Compute & Networking segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nEven then, I can\u2019t help feeling a bit queasy about the stock\u2019s nosebleed valuation. At over 49-times forward earnings, Nvidia is priced for perfection. The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, and we\u2019re likely in the late innings of this economic cycle.\n\nThat said, the AI revolution shows no signs of slowing down. Companies are racing to build out AI infrastructure, and Nvidia remains the premier picks-and-shovels play in this sector. To justify its lofty multiple, Nvidia will need to keep delivering massive earnings beats. Anything less than stellar results could trigger a sharp pullback in this name.\n\nRegardless, I\u2019ve been proven wrong whenever I\u2019ve doubted Nvidia. The company continues to deliver massive beats quarter after quarter. If this AI wave is truly as transformative as it seems, today\u2019s lofty valuation may end up looking cheap in hindsight. In the near-term, Nvidia looks risky at these levels. But zooming out over a five to 10 year time horizon, I still see tremendous potential. If the AI boom continues, $500+ per share doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. Of course, that\u2019s a big if.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU)\n\nMicron\u2019s stock price has surged over 65% year-to-date on the back of the strong demand for its memory chips from data center and AI customers. The company recently reported solid Q3 fiscal 2024 results, beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue jumped 81% year-over-year to $6.81 billion, while 30 cents of earnings per share handily beat estimates.\n\nMicron is benefiting from some powerful megatrends right now, especially the rapid growth of artificial intelligence applications that require enormous amounts of memory and storage. The company is a key supplier to AI leaders like Nvidia, with its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips integrated into Nvidia\u2019s latest AI accelerators. Micron expects record revenue in fiscal 2024 and 2025 driven by these AI tailwinds.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish on the stock, with Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently upgrading Micron to \u201cequal-weight\u201d and hiking its price target. The firm cited better-than-expected AI chip demand as a key reason for its more positive stance. Of the 27 analysts covering Micron, 25 have buy ratings.\n\nHowever, I have some reservations about Micron\u2019s longer-term prospects. The memory chip industry is highly cyclical, and Micron\u2019s growth is expected to slow dramatically after fiscal 2025, unless AI demand significantly exceeds expectations. Micron financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock also doesn\u2019t look particularly cheap at around 14-times forward earnings, given the boom-bust nature of its business.\n\nSo while I believe Micron will continue to ride high in the near-term on the AI wave, investors should be aware of the risks further out on the horizon. I believe the stock could trade less than $300 a decade from now. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong, though.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nAMD\u2019s strategy seems to be taking a page out of its playbook against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the CPU market \u2013 targeting budget-conscious companies and developers with its lower-cost AI offerings. The company\u2019s MI300 series GPUs are reportedly delivering strong performance for AI workloads at a better value than Nvidia\u2019s pricey H100 chips. This approach could be especially appealing to cash-strapped AI startups looking to keep costs in check.\n\nFinancially, AMD is already seeing a big AI boost, with data center revenue up 80% year-over-year in Q1 to $2.3 billion. Management now expects data center GPU sales to top $4 billion this year, up from a prior $3.5 billion forecast. Analysts are taking notice, with Piper Sandler naming AMD its top large-cap pick and New Street Research setting a bullish $345 price target for 2026.\n\nHowever, AMD still has a steep hill to climb to catch Nvidia, which controls around 70-95% of the AI chip market. And while AMD stock trades at a premium, its growth and margins pale in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s jaw-dropping numbers. Growth in the company\u2019s Data Center segment also hasn\u2019t been as eye-popping. AMD Data Center segment growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nSo, can AMD pull off in AI what it did against Intel in CPUs? Only time will tell. But if AMD can capture even a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s AI market share, the stock could have a long runway ahead, likely sending this stock above the $500 level in a decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights AMD, NVIDIA, Microsoft and Alphabet",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nCan the Silo AI Acquisition Change AMD's Fate, or Is It a Risky Bet?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devicesis expanding its AI ecosystem with the announced acquisition of Silo AI for roughly $665 million in cash. The deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, will strengthen AMD's AI skillset and software expertise.\n\nAMD has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem. In the past 12 months, it has spent $125 million on dozens of acquisitions. Nod.ai and Mipsology are some other notable acquisitions in the recent past.\n\nHelsinki, Finland-based Silo AI offers end-to-end AI solutions and boasts a diverse clientele that includes the likes of Allianz, Philips, Rolls-Royce and Unilever. Silo AI has developed open-source large language models, like Poro and Viking, on AMD platforms in addition to its SiloGen model platform.\n\nAMD's acquisitiveness is aimed at primarily reducing the technological gap with NVIDIA in the ongoing race for AI dominance. Silo AI's team comprises scientists and engineers with extensive experience in developing customized AI models, as well as platforms and solutions for leading enterprises encompassing cloud, embedded and endpoint computing markets.\n\nNevertheless, Silo AI acquisition may not be enough to solve AMD's growing problems which include stiff competition from NVIDIA in the race for AI chip dominance and continued weakness in the Embedded and Gaming businesses.\n\nStrong Portfolio Fails to Boost AMD's Prospects\n\nBoth AMD and NVDA have been the darlings of investors, driven by the massive proliferation of AI that has created a strong demand for GPU chips required to power AI models. The AI space is expected to remain robust with increased spending by cloud computing providers like Microsoft and Alphabet.\n\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\n\nAMD's initiatives to expand its portfolio are making it well-positioned to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market.\n\nStory continues\n\nNew offerings like the Instinct MI325X accelerator are helping to expand AMD's footprint in the data center market. AMD has launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\n\nHowever, the challenging macroeconomic environment and rising uncertainty over the upcoming Presidential elections don't bode well for AMD, given its much smaller size and GPU market share compared to NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA's strategy to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline intensifies competition for AMD. Moreover, initiatives by tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms to build their own platforms for AI don't bode well for AMD.\n\nSluggish Embedded & Gaming Hurts AMD Prospects\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year over year. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenues are expected to be flat, while the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Embedded revenues is currently pegged at $847.4 million, indicating a 45.7% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming is pegged at $661.94 million, suggesting a massive 165.4% decline.\n\nAMD expects second-quarter 2024 revenues to be $5.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 6% and sequential growth of approximately 4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.71 billion, indicating 6.54% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 66 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and suggesting 13.79% year-over-year growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD shares have jumped more than 14% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors industry's gain of 12.4% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 4.7%. NVIDIA has gained 7.7% over the same timeframe.\n\nHowever, we believe the recent share price momentum will be short-lived, given the rising fundamental challenges. AMD has a Growth Style Score of D, which makes the stock unattractive for growth-oriented investors. A Value Style Score of F indicates a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which indicates that investors should stay away in the near term.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Ericsson (ERIC) Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates, Top Line Falls",
        "content": "Ericsson ERIC reported modest second-quarter 2024 results, with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line missing the same. In spite of steady sales in the Enterprise, Cloud Software and Services segment, soft demand in the Networks led to a top-line contraction year over year. Solid sales growth in North America is offset by declining capex investments in India. Higher IPR licensing revenues, cost optimization and a robust portfolio boosted the gross margin. Healthy improvement in free cash flow backed by improvement in working capital is a tailwind.\n\nNet Income\n\nEricsson reported a net loss of SEK 11 billion ($1.03 billion) or a loss of SEK 3.34 (31 cents) per share in the second quarter compared with a net loss of SEK 0.6 billion or SEK 0.21 per share in the prior-year quarter. Non-cash impairment charges of SEK 11.4 billion and a decline in net sales impacted the bottom line during the quarter. Adjusted earnings came in at a penny per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents.\n\nEricsson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nEricsson price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ericsson Quote\n\nRevenues\n\nEricsson generated SEK 59.8 billion ($5.59 billion) in revenues, down 7% year over year. Demand softness in the Networks segment impeded the top line. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion.\n\nSegment Results\n\nThe Networks segment generated SEK 37.7 billion ($3.53 billion), down 11% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s tally of SEK 42.4 billion. The top line beat our revenue estimate of SEK 36.3 billion. The segment\u2019s gross margin improved to 46.1% from 39.3% in the year-ago quarter. The unit registered a 55% sales decline in South East Asia, Oceania and India. Following a record level of investments in 2023, operator capex significantly declined in India. However, sales in the Networks segment from North America improved 20% year over year due to increased network investments.\r\n\r\nCloud Software and Services contributed SEK 15.2 billion ($1.42 billion) in revenues, marginally up from SEK15.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed our revenue estimate of SEK 14.7 billion. Adjusted gross margin improved to 37.2% from 33.9% in the prior-year quarter. Increased IPR licensing revenues, commercial discipline and improvement in delivery performance propelled the gross margin.\r\n\r\nEnterprise sales remained flat at SEK 6.5 billion ($608 million), up 2% year over year. Net sales beat our revenue estimate of SEK 4.77 billion. Growth in Enterprise Wireless Solutions supported the top line. However, declining sales in the Global Communication Platform reversed the positive trend. Adjusted gross margin was 51.1%, up from 46.3% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nOther revenues was SEK 0.5 billion ($47 million) matching the prior-year quarter\u2019s figure of SEK 0.5 billion.\r\n\r\nRegion-wise, South-East Asia, Oceania and India registered revenues of SEK 7.7 billion ($720 million), down from SEK 13.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. Revenues from North East Asia fell 10% year over year to SEK 4.6 billion ($430 million). Net sales from North America increased 15% year over year to SEK 16.6 billion ($1.55 billion) backed by contract wins and growing network investments.\r\n\r\nEurope and Latin American markets witnessed a 2% year-over-year decline to SEK 15.6 billion ($1.46 billion). Revenues in the Middle East and Africa fell 8% to SEK 4.9 billion ($458 million) due to a slowdown in capex investments. Revenues from other regions rose to SEK 10.4 billion ($972 million) from SEK 9.8 billion in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Details\n\nAdjusted gross increased to SEK 26.3 billion ($2.46 billion) from the year-ago figure of SEK 24.7 billion. Adjusted gross margin was 43.9%, up from 38.3% in the year-earlier quarter, driven by an enhanced gross margin in the Networks segment. Higher IPR licensing revenues, cost reduction actions and a competitive product portfolio elevated the gross margin.\n\nCash Flow and Liquidity\n\nEricsson generated SEK 9.3 billion ($870 million) cash from operating activities during the quarter. As of Jun 30, 2024, the company had a net cash of SEK 13.1 billion ($12.36 billion) with SEK 26.1 billion liabilities for post-employment benefits.\n\nOutlook\n\nManagement anticipates market conditions to remain challenging this year due to a slowdown in network investments in India. However, contract deliveries in North America will likely improve net sales in the second half of the year.\r\n\r\nFor the third quarter of 2024, revenues from the Networks, Cloud Software and Services segment are expected to follow the average seasonality between the second and the third quarter in the last three years. Adjusted Gross margin in the Networks segment is likely to be in the range of 45-47%. Restructuring charges are projected to be around SEK 3-4 billion in 2024.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nEricsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.43%, on average. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 11.48%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\r\n\r\nMotorola Solutions Inc. MSI provides services and solutions to government segments and public safety programs, along with large enterprises and wireless infrastructure services. Motorola carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\r\nIt delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.54% and has a long-term growth expectation of 9.47%. In the last reported quarter, Motorola delivered an earnings surprise of 11.51%.\r\n\r\nSilicon Motion Technology Corporation SIMO, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.72%.\r\n\r\nIt is a leading developer of microcontroller ICs for NAND flash storage devices. The semiconductor company also designs, develops and markets high-performance, low-power semiconductor solutions for original equipment manufacturers and other customers.\r\n\r\nNote: SEK 1 = $0.0935081 (period average from Apr 1, 2024 to Jun 30, 2024); SEK 1 = $0.0943156 (as of Jun 30, 2024).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Ciena Corporation CIEN recently tied up with Sodvin AS, to deploy its cutting-edge XGS-PON Solution across the Trondelag county, Norway,\u00a0 promising faster Internet speed in the Nordics.\r\n\r\nBy adopting Ciena\u2019s XGS-PON Solution, Norway-based telecom firm Sodvin AS aims to bolster its existing broadband infrastructure, moving beyond traditional GPON technology. With symmetrical speeds of up to 10 Gb/s both upstream and downstream, residents and businesses in Trondelag are likely to experience a significant boost in their Internet capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the XGS-PON solution, Sodvin\u2019s residential broadband infrastructure leverages Ciena\u2019s 5164 Routers, XGS-PON uOLTs (micro optical line terminals) and 3801 ONUs (optical network units).\u00a0 These components enable Sodvin to expand its network capacity in response to growing demand, ensuring that customers receive reliable service with improved quality. The use of uOLT pluggables further enhances deployment capabilities, allowing Sodvin to scale operations seamlessly while maintaining a sustainable footprint.\r\n\r\nHanover, MD-based CIEN is one of the leading providers of optical networking equipment, software and services.

In June 2024, Ciena announced that Denmark-based digital service provider TDC NET is harnessing its rich portfolio of advanced solutions to improve metro and long-haul networks powered by scalability and sustainability. \r\n\r\nHowever, the persistence of macroeconomic volatility is causing lower-than-expected order volumes from service providers, thereby affecting the company\u2019s performance. High customer concentration risk is another concern. A bulk of its revenues is concentrated among a few large global communications service providers. Given the competitive nature of the industry, the loss of any one of its key customers could severely impact the company's performance. \r\n\r\nCIEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

        "title": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -1.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 5.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +133.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $2.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +106.2%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.37 indicates a change of +25.7% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +109%. The $117.55 billion and $151.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +93% and +28.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nNvidia reported revenues of $26.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +262.1%. EPS of $0.61 for the same period compares with $0.11 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.02%. The EPS surprise was +11.48%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nNvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "'Nvidia Is Slowly Becoming The IBM Of The AI Era' Says Former AMD And Tesla Engineer. Here's The Problem With That Comparison\n\nJim Keller, a well-known engineer who\u2019s worked at AMD and Tesla and now leads the AI company Tenstorrent, recently said something interesting on the DemystifySci podcast. He thinks Nvidia is becoming like IBM back in the day but in the AI world. While this shows how powerful Nvidia is right now in AI hardware, it also raises some concerns.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with low minimum investment.\n\nNvidia\u2019s smart move to focus on AI early has paid off big time \u2014 its earnings were over $26 billion in the first quarter of 2024. It\u2019s also one of the top three companies in the world by market valuation, breathing down the necks of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe company is now a major player in the AI hardware market, with its powerful GPUs used by tech giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. It seems that everyone is on the Nvidia hype train, as CEO Jensen Huang calls AI the \"next industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia at the center.\n\nKeller, an extremely accomplished engineer and entrepreneur, knows what he\u2019s talking about. However, he might not realize just how unfortunate his comment that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era\" is.\n\nIn the early 1980s, IBM was huge in the personal computer market. Their PCs were everywhere, and saying \"PC\" often meant you were talking about an IBM machine. But, IBM\u2019s reign didn\u2019t last long because of a few key mistakes and growing competition.\n\nTrending: Sun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!\n\nIBM\u2019s strategy of using an open architecture helped it dominate the market initially, but it also made it easy for other companies to make IBM-compatible PCs. These competitors sold similar products at lower prices, which ate into IBM's market share.\n\nThe partnership between IBM and Microsoft also backfired as Bill Gates\u2019 company retained the rights to sell its operating system (MS-DOS) to other companies, paving the way for the rise of Microsoft Windows.\n\nAs PC Gamer reports, as Windows became the dominant operating system, PCs became more associated with Microsoft than IBM. IBM\u2019s slow adaptation to market changes and sticking to old business models allowed competitors to gain a foothold. By the 1990s, IBM's PC business was struggling, and in 2005, IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo, leaving the personal computer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Many are surprised that they are eligible for a tax reduction on their home, with just a few seconds you can see if you can save in 3 minutes or less.\n\nNvidia could run into similar problems. As more companies start making AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs might get cheaper because of the competition. Technology moves fast, so today\u2019s best chips can become outdated quickly. As Nvidia keeps growing, it could face more competition and rules to follow, just like IBM did.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the $600 billion AI question. As Analyst David Chan from Sequoia writes, there\u2019s a big gap between the money being spent on AI infrastructure and the revenue AI is actually bringing in.\n\nAI companies need to make about $600 billion a year to earn enough to cover these huge investments.\n\nChan said the gap was \"only\" $200 billion in September 2023. Even though Nvidia is making a lot of money, the rest of the AI market isn\u2019t growing fast enough.\n\nKeller\u2019s comparison to IBM is both a compliment and a warning because Nvidia's success now doesn\u2019t guarantee its future. After all, the tech world is full of once market-leading companies that didn\u2019t keep up with changes.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "title": "3 Powerhouse Stocks Set to Dominate 2024\u2019s Second Half",
        "content": "Buying a stock is very easy but picking the right stock is tough. As we embark on the second half of the year, it is time to reevaluate your stock investment portfolio. The first half has been incredible for several stocks as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 steadily hit new highs and now is the time to look for ideal second-half stocks. Having dealt with market uncertainty, war, and high inflation, the market turned in an incredible performance in the first half.\n\nSeveral stocks hit 52-week highs in the first half and I believe the upward rally will continue this year. A Fed rate cut could also boost the market further and take stocks higher. If you want to make the most of this upside, here are three powerhouse stocks that can dominate the second half of the year. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.\n\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\n\nA giant tech stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is an industry darling that has proved its strength time and again. Investors who bought Nvidia in 2021 are enjoying massive gains today and if you missed that chance, the recent stock split is a good opportunity for you to accumulate the stock. Nvidia\u2019s rally isn\u2019t over yet and the upcoming quarterly results could give the stock another strong push.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMultiple catalysts are working for Nvidia. There was a time when it generated\u00a0the majority\u00a0of its revenue from the gaming segment but this has changed today. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) leader with a strong market share. No competitor has been able to come close to Nvidia\u2019s glory and it is making the most of the imbalance between the demand and supply of AI chips.\n\nThe company launched the\u00a0Blackwell platform which could drive growth in the current quarter. Its GPU architecture comes with six technologies that ensure accelerated computing. It is set to replace the H100 chip later this year and could deliver solid gains and higher revenue growth for the industry darling.\n\nUBS analyst believes the stock could hit $150 per share citing a robust demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Nvidia is one stock that has dominated throughout the first half of the year and is set to continue doing the same in the second half.\n\nTrading at $131 today, Nvidia could see a strong momentum when it reports the second-quarter results next month.\n\nSuper Micro Computers (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince we are all obsessed with Nvidia, it makes sense to look out for a company that benefits every time Nvidia grows. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI)\u00a0has exposure to AI and it specializes in equipment for data centers. The massive demand for its products has given a strong boost to the stock which is up 213% YTD and exchanging hands for $895.\n\nStory continues\n\nData centers have become an important aspect of AI and SMCI is set to benefit here. Whenever Nvidia reports impressive quarterly numbers, SMCI soars. However, this does not mean that its fundamentals aren\u2019t\u00a0impressive. The company saw net sales of $3.85 billion and a net income of $402 million in the\u00a0third quarter. For the fourth quarter, it\u00a0is aiming\u00a0for sales in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion.\n\nThe close ties with Nvidia help the business move. Whenever Nvidia launches a new chip, SMCI will integrate\u00a0the same into its products. The company can build new systems efficiently and quickly, catering to rising demand. It is working on expanding manufacturing and has invested in a\u00a0new facility in Malaysia which will\u00a0help increase the revenue capacity to $20 billion.\n\nIf the management decides to follow the footsteps of Nvidia, the stock will be an ideal candidate for a stock split. Considering the soaring stock price, investors might be discouraged to invest and this could lead to a stock split.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn unstoppable stock, streaming giant Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) is up 65% YTD and is trading for $311 today. The stock could be on an incredible rally in the second half with over 239 million premium global subscribers. A dominant player in the industry, Spotify offers a free plan and a premium version for users.\n\nFundamentally, Spotify is only getting stronger with a\u00a020% YOY jump in revenue and an impressive 184% YOY jump in EPS to 97 cents per share. The company is steadily working on global expansions and building a strong content library\u00a0that will\u00a0drive users. It has adequate cash flow to pursue expansion plans and invest in the platform to improve user experience.\n\nThe company has set itself apart by investing in some\u00a0of the\u00a0popular podcasts that draw listeners to the platform. It holds the second place in the\u00a0global audiobook segment and has more than 375,000 titles.\n\nIt is also investing in AI to improve the platform and this investment will pay off in the coming years. Its new feature called\u00a0AI DJ will create unique playlists for the listener based on their preferences. Besides AI, it is working on features that help improve user engagement and has ended the first quarter with 615 million monthly active users.\n\n18 analysts on\u00a0TipRanks have a buy rating with a price target of $355.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Big Reasons to Avoid Stocks in Roaring Kitty\u2019s Crosshairs",
        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for stocks to avoid, you might want to start with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d the nom de plume of meme-stock investor extraordinaire, Keith Gill, bought into GameStop. Then, continuing on the Ryan Cohen theme, Gill bought shares of the online pet goods retailer that Cohen co-founded.\n\nGoogle \u201cKeith Gill\u2019s net worth\u201d and you\u2019ll get a lot of answers. A screenshot of Gill\u2019s portfolio in early June showed his net worth at least $289 million according to CNBC reporting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou do not want to emulate what Roaring Kitty is doing with his largesse. To gain this kind of money, and then treat it so casually, is tantamount to financial malpractice.\n\nSure, he\u2019s not acting in an official role as a financial advisor. But plenty of people will think they too can strike lightning in a bottle.\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three reasons to avoid all Roaring Kitty stocks.\n\nHe\u2019s Bet on Two Very Iffy Stocks\n\nTogether, GameStop and Chewy have generated $253 million in EBITDA in the trailing 12 months from revenue of $16.16 billion, an EBITDA margin of 1.6%. Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) EBITDA margin of 63.5% in the latest 12 months is 40x better.\n\nSuffice to say, the gap in quality between these two types of businesses, is \u201cGrand Canyon\u201d is size and scope.\n\nOn July 1, Gill filed his Schedule 13G indicating he held 9,001,000 shares of Chewy. These shares were bought June 24. Based on Chewy\u2019s current share price of $26.47, the 6.6% stake in Chewy is worth a little over $218 million.\n\nAccording to its latest proxy, that would make Gill the fourth-largest holder of Class A shares (1 vote each) behind only BC Partners \u2014 who own all 298.9 million Class B shares (10 votes each), which can be converted into Class A shares \u2014 Baillie Gifford & Co. (13.5%) and Vanguard (7.0%).\n\nExcept for Gill, All of Chewy\u2019s Top Investors are Diversified\n\nBC Partners is an alternative asset manager. By nature, its objective is to buy good businesses, improve them and then sell them for a big profit.\n\nIts most recent sale of Chewy stock was on July 1, selling 1.34 million Class A shares at prices between $29.44 and $32.47 a share. In January, it sold 12.325 million at $20.29, likely its biggest share sale yet.\n\nThe only reason BC Partners is still holding any shares five years after its IPO at $22 is to ensure they get a better return on their investment.\u00a0It is ready to exit, prices willing.\n\nOver 128 investments are valued at more than 170 billion euros ($183.87 billion). The upper middle market investor has plenty of diversification to enable it to wait for the best Chewy outcome. The same goes for Baillie Gifford and Vanguard.\n\nStory continues\n\nApparently, Gill has all his eggs in two baskets. Not even Warren Buffett is that focused on his investments. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to put Gill in the Investor Hall of Fame just yet.\n\nRyan Cohen Has Yet to Prove Himself\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe that on his own, Gill amassed the $218 million required to buy the 6.6% interest in Chewy.\n\nIt\u2019s a wild theory, given GameStop\u2019s board has given the green light for Cohen\u2019s joint roles of CEO and portfolio manager. Additionally, the company\u2019s two ATM (at-the-market) markets brought in $3 billion in new cash.\n\nRegardless if all of my speculation is poppycock, the important thing to remember about Ryan Cohen is that he has yet to prove himself. He couldn\u2019t make Chewy profitable as its CEO and he\u2019s spent close to four years on GameStop with no concrete plan for its revival. Thus, you ought to be very careful about following the moves of Roaring Kitty.\n\nThey\u2019re bound to come back to bite you.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Growth Stocks to Grab Now",
        "content": "One of the most important factors for investors to consider is growth. But how does one easily identify which companies are doing the best job growing? My solution is to look to the Portfolio Grader for A-rated growth stocks.\n\nWhile it\u2019s great that a stock is seeing gains over the last few weeks or months, growth is the name of the game, a fundamental aspect of success and sustainability. Companies that are seeing growth are more likely to remain strong and be long-term investments.\n\nCompanies need growth to scale and improve efficiency. If you\u2019re a car manufacturer and selling 30 cars per month, you\u2019re absorbing a lot of overhead to make those vehicles \u2013 and you\u2019re likely not turning a profit. But if you\u2019re making 3,000 vehicles, your per-unit costs go way down. That\u2019s how companies become profitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowth enables a company to expand its market share. By increasing sales and acquiring new customers, companies become stronger and eventually, with enough growth, becomes a leader in their industries.\n\nI\u2019ve selected several A-rated growth stocks to review, based on their outstanding overall grades in the Portfolio Grader. The Portfolio Grader considers a variety of factors, including growth, earnings performance, analyst sentiment and momentum. So, A-rated stocks are the strongest overall companies in the market.\n\nBut what makes these A-rated growth stocks stand out today is that all the companies we\u2019re going to consider also get either an \u201cA\u201d or a \u201cB\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader for growth.\n\nYou can expect each of these A-rated growth stocks to continue to perform, because the companies they represent are successfully expanding \u2013 and you can see it in the bottom line.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be the most compelling stock in the market. As the maker of powerful graphics processing units that are used to power top-line artificial intelligence programs, Nvidia stock soared to previously unimaginable heights. The stock is up 220% over the last 12 months and 170% so far this year.\n\nBut interestingly, Nvidia seems to be on a bit of a break. Since June 18, the stock is up only 3%, raising concerns from some nervous investors that we may finally be nearing a top.\n\nNonsense.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely that this is just part of the Wall Street summer doldrums \u2013 when the market sees less activity from Memorial Day to Labor day. But remember that Nvidia\u2019s next earnings release is scheduled for Aug. 21, so this hiatus will surely come to an end sooner rather than later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdjusted earnings for Nvidia were up 461% in the most recently reported quarter. And since earnings are far outpacing the stock\u2019s growth, Nvidia stock is getting cheaper every day on a valuation basis, which makes it among the A-rated growth stocks you need in your portfolio.\n\nNVDA stock gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for both growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo. It\u2019s responsible for the Chome search engine and Android smartphones. Alphabet is a powerhouse that\u2019s taken its rightful place, as has Nvidia, as a Magnificent 7 stock.\n\nSo then, why is the CEO selling shares?\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly sold\u00a022,500 Alphabet shares\u00a0on June 20, raising some investor eyebrows. I wrote about it recently for InvestorPlace, and as I said then, Pichai still has 227,000 shares of GOOG stock, so I\u2019m not concerned at all. In fact, this is more of a position-trimming move than anything else.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be bullish about Alphabet, including its massive position in internet search and the dominance of the Chrome browser. Alphabet brought in $80.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Its operating income was up 32% to $25.4 billion.\n\nGOOG stock is up 36% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the third and last Magnificent 7 stock we\u2019ll talk about today. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the operator of the powerful social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Reels.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerburg and friends at Harvard University, Meta is powerful because it encourages users to connect with friends and family and make new connections.\n\nPeople who use Facebook and Instagram willingly share their likes and dislikes, where they\u2019ve been and what they plan to do \u2013 and that\u2019s all information that Meta can use to sell to advertisers.\n\nMeta Platforms\u2019 advertising platforms are powerful, there\u2019s no doubt. With all the personal information in Meta\u2019s databases, advertisers can make extremely targeted advertising campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s why Meta brought in $36.4 billion in advertising revenue in the first quarter, making up roughly 98% of its total revenue. Advertising dollars were up 23% from a year ago, making this one of the A-rated growth stocks to keep your eyes on.\n\nI\u2019m expecting that trend to continue and META stock to pop again when the company reports earnings on July 31. For now, Meta stock is up 51% in 2024, and its gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipotle restaurant store exterior sign and storefront. CMG stock\n\nSource: Robert V Schwemmer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not too often you see a company with a 50-to-1 stock split, as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) executed this summer. But I like it because it\u2019s a sign of management that is very deliberate in its actions.\n\nChipotle stock topped $3,200 per share \u2013 an enormous number \u2013 before its June 25 split, making it one of the biggest in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe split makes the stock more accessible and attractive to retail investors as well as employees who want to participate in the company\u2019s stock purchase plan \u2013 it was a good move all around.\n\nI also see the move as part of the company\u2019s culture. Remember, this is a restaurant stock with more than 3,400 locations, but no franchises. Chipotle maintains ownership of every location because it\u2019s the only way it can ensure company quality and standards.\n\nChipotle also famously doesn\u2019t have any freezers in its locations, which means that the ingredients for its burritos, salads and burrito bowls must always be made fresh.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $2.7 billion, up 14.1% from a year ago. Comparable restaurant sales were up 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%. The company is reporting second-quarter earnings on July 24.\n\nCMG stock is up 27% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and an \u201cA\u201d overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) isn\u2019t part of the Magnificent 7. But if the list ever expands to eight or 10 stocks, it might be difficult to keep Supermicro off the list.\n\nSupermicro makes the server infrastructure that is needed by companies that are buying up all the Nvidia GPUs to build large language models and other generative AI products. Supermicro can provide custom server architecture solutions to bundle those GPUs and allow them to work together.\n\nSupermicro is reportedly providing and assembling half of the racks AI-supercomputer racks that xAI, the artificial intelligence startup operated by Elon Musk, is creating to develop an AI chatbot to rival ChatGPT.\n\nThe company is seeing massive growth, with sales of $3.85 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from $1.28 billion a year ago. Net income of $402 million was up from $86 million a year ago.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s another SMCI catalyst next week. Typically, Supermicro pre-announces between 18 and 24 days after the end of the quarter, so that could be as early as next week. Should the company provide evidence of another blowout quarter and/or dazzling guidance, SMCI stock will surely jump.\n\nSMCI stock is up 216% in 2024. It gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a computer security company that uses AI and machine learning to stop threats in real time. Its cloud-native platform that provides endpoint protection, cloud workloads, identity and data.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform is its primary product, but CrowdStrike also offers modules that companies can use to customize their products.\n\nThe modules, which include things like endpoint security, data security, IT operations, threat intelligence and more, serves as a successful business plan because customers can always start small and add on as they go.\n\nCrowdStrike says 65% of its customers purchase and use at least five modules. Revenue for the company\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $921 million, up 33% from a year ago. Subscription revenue was $872.2 million, up 34% from the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nIt also got a boost last month when CWRD stock was added to the S&P 500, which means that exchange-traded funds and other products that track the index are buying CRWD stock.\n\nCrowdStrike stock is up 47% this year. It gets \u201cA\u201d rating for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was famously one of the original FAANG stocks that were considered market darlings before the rise of AI and the Magnificent 7. But Netflix, which is the premiere streaming service, hasn\u2019t really gone away.\n\nIn fact, the stock has only gotten better.\n\nNetflix management made a huge decision when it ended its free password sharing program. Before, the company all but encouraged the practice and password sharing was common between friends, family and partners was common.\n\nBut the company finally acknowledged that it was leaving a lot of money on the table, so the program came to an end. Netflix instituted an $8 monthly charge to any account that was sharing a password with someone outside the physical household. And now paid memberships are up from 232.6 million a year ago to 269.6 million in the last quarter.\n\nRevenue also grew \u2013 up 14.8% to $9.3 billion, and the stock returned to levels not seen since 2015.\n\nNFLX stock is up 39% this year, and gets \u201cA\u201d ratings for growth and overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had LONG position(s) in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.\u00a0Louis Navellier did not have (either directly or indirectly) any other positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nThe InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had LONG positions in NVDA, SMCI and CRWD.

        "title": "Nvidia's Stock Is Up 170% to Start 2024. Could It Double to Finish the Year?",
        "content": "In 2023, there were few better stocks to own than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The stock rose nearly 240%, and many investors (including myself) concluded that 2024 wouldn't be a repeat of the same. But we were wrong.\n\nOn the heels of an incredible 2023 performance, Nvidia more than doubled in 2024, as the stock has risen 170% so far. That's an amazing run that is incomparable when you consider Nvidia's size.\n\nBut after such a strong year, could Nvidia double again from this point? After all, it proved investors wrong multiple times.\n\nArtificial intelligence is driving Nvidia's stock higher\n\nNvidia's rise has been tied to the artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush. To train AI models, you need some serious computing power. Central processing units (CPU) inside PCs don't cut it because it can only process one calculation at a time. In place of CPUs, graphics processing units (GPUs) are used.\n\nGPUs can perform multiple calculations in parallel, which is key for arduous workloads. Additionally, GPUs can be connected to create incredibly powerful computers that can crank out state-of-the-art AI models in no time.\n\nWith many companies building servers outfitted with thousands of GPUs, Nvidia stands to benefit.\n\nWhile there are a few competitors in the GPU market, none compare to Nvidia. As a result, Nvidia has an iron grip on this market, as anyone building a supercomputer to train AI models is likely an Nvidia customer.\n\nThis has caused its sales to skyrocket, with Nvidia posting multiple quarters of revenue tripling. NVDA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt also achieved record profitability alongside its revenue growth for a few reasons. First, it can charge what it wants with a best-in-class product that is light-years ahead of the competition. Second, it already has the production capacity to produce these GPUs. And finally, it doesn't need to to spend on marketing because the demand is already in place.\n\nThese factors combine to give Nvidia the best chance at peak margins, which it posted recently. NVDA Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nAs a result of Nvidia's success, investors are been willing to pay a substantial premium to own the stock. It trades at 46 times forward earnings, which indicates investors are willing to pay up for Nvidia's future growth, which has already been penciled in.\n\nAll this information was known entering 2024, yet the market still bid up the stock throughout the year. With that in mind, could Nvidia double by the end of 2024?\n\nIf the stock doubled, many records would be broken\n\nIt would be unreal for Nvidia to double by the end of 2024. While there's no doubt Nvidia's business will succeed throughout 2024 and beyond, there are questions about the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is valued at $3.1 trillion. If it doubles, that means it would be worth $6.2 trillion. No company has ever been worth $4 trillion, so many records would need to be shattered between now and the end of the year for this to occur.\n\nFurthermore, the stock's valuation would have to practically double as well. Although Nvidia has steadily blown expectations out of the water, aggressive growth is still penciled into the stock, and these expectations won't decrease. So, for Nvidia to double, it would likely have to trade at more than 80 times forward earnings.\n\nFew fully profitable companies have sustainably traded above 40 times earnings in the history of the stock market, let alone 80. As a result, I don't think expecting the stock to double is feasible.\n\nWhile Nvidia has been a superstar over the past year and a half, I don't think it's wise for investors to expect the stock to double anytime soon.

        "content": "The apparent winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom have been smoking hot of late. While some of the names may be overdue for a correction over the next year, I view many of them as reasonably priced, given the magnitude of growth-powering tailwinds.\n\nIn any case, those seeking to get more bang for their buck should probably check out the names that are not at the front of the AI race. Some of the so-called downstream AI stocks may still be slightly off Wall Street\u2019s radar, but likely not for long, as they look to post solid numbers, thanks primarily to the AI boom.\n\nCheck out three \u201chidden winners\u201d from AI that you may not have considered yet. Though it could take a while before they turn into obvious AI plays like the Magnificent Seven, the potential gains may be worth the wait!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has pretty much shed its reputation as a tech-shy big-box retailer just waiting to get disrupted. Whether it\u2019s the rise of e-commerce or the continued surge in AI technologies, Walmart has done a fantastic job of keeping up with the advanced times.\n\nThough it\u2019s quite a stretch to refer to Walmart as a tech company, I think it\u2019s a mistake to discount the company\u2019s efforts to monetize new technologies, like AI, whether to save money, improve customers\u2019 shopping experiences, or bolster sales. Walmart isn\u2019t just using AI for the positive press; it\u2019s leveraging the technology to unlock monetizable benefits.\n\nThe company is tapping into AI at some of its refrigerated warehouses. These smart AI-equipped warehouses can prevent waste and trim operating costs over the long haul.\n\nIndeed, WMT stock isn\u2019t cheap anymore at 30.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), but if you believe in Walmart\u2019s innovation story, the multiple is still too low.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a $110 billion heavyweight in the cybersecurity industry. Cybersecurity solutions have proven rather resilient even amid cutbacks in enterprise IT spending. Like insurance, cutting too deeply into cybersecurity solutions could entail an unfathomable amount of risk. Indeed, cyber breaches are one of those low-probability events that can have a catastrophic impact.\n\nAs generative AI improves at an accelerating pace, AI-powered hackers pose a growing threat to large enterprises. With Precision AI touted in a marketing campaign featuring Keanu Reeves, Palo Alto has a system that effectively leverages machine learning and automation to help clients play chess as hackers play checkers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is one of those AI stocks that should be as obvious as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In time, I think the cybersecurity titan will be more synonymous with AI.\n\nFinally, once IT spending booms again, PANW stock could be right back to making higher highs.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock has been under pressure since mid-June, now down around 24% from its recent all-time highs. Indeed, the $24.5 billion solar cell innovator took one straight to the chin following the Trump-Biden debate. Political risks aside, First Solar seems like a first pick for investors seeking premier growth in solar power.\n\nThe AI boom, which seems to be getting started, will entail a potentially massive uptick in energy consumption. Utility firms will need to catch up with (hopefully) new renewable projects to be ready for the new AI data centers that will pop up across the globe.\n\nAs First Solar improves its manufacturing efficiency and capacity, FSLR stock seems primed to spike as the number of AI interactions swells over the coming years. If anything, the recent post-debate slump appears like a fantastic opportunity to buy as tech companies open their wallets to power their data centers in the greenest way possible.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These Nvidia-Backed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Could Soar 73% to 89% Higher, According to Wall Street",
        "content": "If artificial intelligence (AI) is the new gold rush, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the preeminent supplier of picks and shovels. The strong demand for Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) is mind-boggling.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't just helping major corporations build and deploy AI models. It has also invested in several potential rising stars of the AI world. These Nvidia-backed stocks could soar 73% to 89% higher, according to Wall Street.\n\n1. Nano-X Imaging\n\nNvidia owns only a tiny stake in Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX) worth around $583,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2024. However, Wall Street has great expectations for this small medical technology company.\n\nOnly three analysts surveyed by LSEG(OTC: LNST.Y) in June covered Nano-X Imaging. Two of them rated the stock as a \"buy\" with the third recommending it as a \"strong buy.\" The average 12-month price target for Nano-X reflects an upside potential of 89%. Even the most pessimistic analyst thinks the stock can move nearly 60% higher.\n\nNano-X Imaging develops medical imaging technology that's much more cost-effective than traditional X-ray systems. The company also has a subsidiary, Nanox.AI, that uses AI to diagnose undetected chronic diseases.\n\n2. Recursion Pharmaceuticals\n\nNvidia owns more than 7.7 million shares of Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX). At the end of Q1, this position was valued at nearly $77 million. Although Recursion's shares have declined significantly since then, analysts think the stock will rebound.\n\nThe average 12-month price target for Recursions Pharmaceuticals is 73% above the current share price. The lowest price target reflects a 21% upside potential. Interestingly, though, only two of the six analysts surveyed by LSEG in June rate Recursion as a \"buy.\" The others have a \"hold\" rating on the stock.\n\nRecursion refers to itself as a \"TechBio\" company rather than a biotech company to underscore its focus on using technology for drug discovery and development. Its BioHive-2 supercomputer uses 63 Nvidia DGX H100 GPUs and 504 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs. BioHive-2 uses AI models to discover new drugs. It's the world's fastest supercomputer wholly owned and operated by a biopharmaceutical company.\n\n3. Soundhound AI\n\nNvidia owns over 1.7 million shares of Soundhound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN). This stake was worth nearly $10.2 million at the end of Q1. Soundhound has been a big winner so far in 2024 with its share price almost doubling.\n\nWall Street believes this momentum can continue. The average 12-month price target for Soundhound AI reflects an upside potential of roughly 79%. Four of the six analysts surveyed by LSEG in June rate the stock as a \"buy\" or a \"strong buy\" with the other two rating it as a \"hold.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundhound AI is the most pure-play AI company of these three Nvidia investments. It's a leader in developing voice AI systems used by carmakers, restaurants, smart TV makers, and other businesses.\n\nIs Wall Street right about these stocks?\n\nWall Street analysts could be spot on with their projections for Nano-X Imaging, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and Soundhound AI. On the other hand, they could be dead wrong. No one knows for sure how any stock will perform over the next 12 months. However, I agree with the general optimism about two of these Nvidia-backed stocks.\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals has a couple of big partners, Roche and Bayer. The company plans to report results from seven clinical studies over the next 18 months, including five phase 2 trials.\n\nSoundhound AI's revenue continues to grow rapidly, soaring 73% year over year in Q1. The voice AI innovator targets a total addressable market of over $140 billion. Soundhound's customer base already includes a virtual \"who's who\" in the automotive and restaurant industries.\n\nI'm not as upbeat about Nano-X. Despite the promise of its technology, the company's revenue is shrinking instead of climbing.\n\nRisk-averse investors probably won't find any of these stocks appealing. None of them are profitable at this point. However, I think aggressive investors could especially like Recursion and Soundhound AI -- just as Nvidia apparently does.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks riding the wave of excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, perhaps no other stock has done it better than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As the dominant AI chip design company, its semiconductors are in high demand as organizations scramble to buy chips to support their AI needs. Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) is another tech stock riding the AI wave, offering a product that has delivered eye-popping productivity gains with AI's help.\n\nOver the past year, both stocks have done extremely well, with Nvidia reporting 209% gains while Palantir rose nearly 79%. But investing is more about picking stocks based on the promise of future performance. Can both of these stocks keep riding the AI wave? If so, which has the better chance of staying up on the board longer? Let's take a closer look.\n\nNvidia stock has become expensive to own\n\nNvidia has undoubtedly experienced a wild ride thanks to AI. Investors primarily knew it as a graphics and gaming company until the early part of the decade. As recently as fiscal 2022 (ended in January 2022), the company's largest source of revenue was gaming. But even at that time, the company's data center segment had become increasingly important as data centers became a fast-growing market for its GPUs. Additionally, it had begun developing chips specifically for AI purposes.\n\nWhen it became known that Nvidia's AI chips powered ChatGPT, the company's revenue shot massively higher. Thanks to the unprecedented demand for AI chips, the data center segment now accounts for 87% of the company's revenue. Consequently, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended April 28), revenue of $26 billion rose 262% versus year-ago levels. That increase led to a net income of over $15 billion, a yearly gain of 462%!\n\nAdditionally, consensus analyst estimates forecast fiscal 2025 revenue will rise by 98% before slowing to about 34% in fiscal 2026.\n\nAt such growth rates, the 74 P/E ratio might not deter investors. However, that may lead to investors overlooking the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 39 and the price-to-book-value ratio of 63. By comparison, competitor Advanced Micro Devices has a P/S ratio of 12 and a P/BV ratio of 5, an indication of how expensive Nvidia stock has become in comparison to its peers.\n\nWhy investors might consider Palantir\n\nGiven the elevated cost of Nvidia stock, the AI growth story of Palantir may appear more compelling to some investors. Palantir offers data products that yield analytical insights for clients. Its technology has long relied on AI and machine learning. The stock became more appealing to investors when it expanded from national defense-based analysis to developing a product that applied these insights to the commercial sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the game changer for the company came with the introduction of a generative AI platform called the artificial intelligence platform (AIP). It introduced this service using its AIP boot camps, and prospective customers reported considerable productivity gains after attending. For example, one (now) client claimed to accomplish more in one day than a hyperscaler had in four months!\n\nBecause the service is relatively new, investors may have time to get in before a possible buying spree in the stock. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue grew 21% yearly to $634 million. That led to $106 million in net income for Q1 versus just $17 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDespite the productivity gains, Palantir does not appear to be on track for Nvidia-like growth. Analysts predict revenue will grow 21% in 2024 and at the same rate in 2025.\n\nMoreover, the valuation metrics offer a mixed picture for Palantir. On account of its recent profitability, the stock sells at 227 times earnings. Its P/S ratio of 27 is not far behind Nvidia's, though the price-to-book-value ratio of 16 strongly indicates that Palantir is the less expensive stock.\n\nNvidia or Palantir?\n\nAs the metrics stand now, Nvidia remains the more lucrative AI stock. Although it sells at an outlandish price-to-book ratio, its rapid growth may ease concerns about overvaluation.\n\nIn comparison, Palantir has become a pricey stock, likely in anticipation of higher revenue from AIP. Still, the current revenue growth rate and forecasts do not match Nvidia's growth or point to a massive AI-driven increase in revenue. Investors should watch Palantir for signs of massive growth and reevaluate accordingly.\n\nStill, without such signs, Nvidia is more likely to remain the better wave rider of these two AI stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "As the adoption of metaverse technologies may take take years, investors in undervalued metaverse stocks can bet on long-term growth. An unlimited digital world that can accommodate millions of people is a goldmine, as it represents a new market with solvent modern participants. Since the metaverse industry is only in the early stages of its development, buying shares in related companies promises early investment benefits. The field requires many components for its sustainable operation, which expands the list of areas that will gain from the introduction of metaverses.\n\nVirtual reality technologies will play a crucial role in this process, as users need VR headsets and haptic devices. However, infrastructure development also involves computing power providers, chip manufacturers, Internet providers, software and cybersecurity specialists. By 2030, the industry is projected to grow by more than 30% per year. If you are among the first metaverse investors, you can get a piece of the pie from the business, which could be worth more than $2369.70 billion in 2033.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) Fidelity Investments sign hangs from a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLaunched on April 19, 2022, the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ: FMET) is one of the youngest exchange-traded funds in the United States. Its main goal is to track the performance of the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which includes many companies in the metaverse sector. The connection can be diverse: from the production and sale of chips for this area to the full-scale development of the meta-space. The fund offers diversification so that enthusiasts are more likely to benefit from the growth of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn October-November 2022, the asset price did not exceed $20, while now buyers are willing to pay more than $30. The growth is smooth, without sharp jumps and significant plateau zones, anttracting investors with its stability. Over the past 3 months, FMET has added 11.25% to its value and has risen to the current level of $31.94. The inclusion of top-ranked tech stocks in the index, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), has contributed to the current growth, which may continue in the coming months. Experts predict that the stock will reach the $40 mark and have high expectations for the fund\u2019s future.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is a giant of the tech industry, and therefore has enough resources to reconfigure its activities to meet the trends. One of the latest such changes is the reformatting of the 2022-2024 period. The decline in the share price below $100 was the result of concerns about aggressive investment in metaverse initiatives. However, after breaking out of the low point in October 2022, the company began a steady growth that continues to this day. The implementation of AI technology and related advances have propelled Meta to unprecedented heights. With a price per share of $534.69, the company exceeds its 2022 figures by five times, but the potential is still not fully unlocked so META is still among the undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence is paying off in the form of more accurate targeted advertising and, consequently, higher ad prices. The latest earnings report exceeded market expectations and confirmed the correctness of the diversification approach. The bullish sentiment around META continues to grow, as does the wave of excitement over the positive impact of AI, which means we can expect new rounds of the company\u2019s development shortly.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArchitecture, engineering, entertainment, and construction are all areas that require a reliable software provider, and Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) meets this demand. The company with a market capitalization of $53.08 billion has gained a foothold in the market and become an integral part of many high-tech metaverse projects. After the downturn of April-May 2024, Autodesk began to gain momentum, as reflected in its indicators such as the 50-day moving average (+29.12) and the 200-day moving average (+42.99). The latter indicator shows an increase of 21.07%, which characterizes the bullish momentum of the stock. ADSK has not yet caught up with the 52-week high ($279.53), so it remains in the group of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nAutodesk prove its ability to manage resources with its latest unaudited financial results, which indicate a return on equity (ROE) of 65.46% and a net margin of 17.66%. Based, the company is a well-thought-out manager of shareholder capital and generates significant profit from its revenue streams. Even though the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the current fiscal year is 53.34, the expected value for the next fiscal year is 24.49, which demonstrates Autodesk\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "'Warren Buffett Indicator' Sounds Alarm: Stock Market Levels Now Surpass Dot-Com Bubble, Great Financial Crisis\n\nFew investors have more market experience than Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) CEO Warren Buffett, who's seen his fair share of over-extended bull markets. After the Dot-Com Bubble crash in 2000, Buffett noted that comparing the market capitalization of stocks to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the best indicator of whether equities are overvalued or undervalued at current prices.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today? How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\n\nTrouble Brewing? The indicator, dubbed as the \u2018Warren Buffett Indicator' is calculated by looking at the ratio of the total market index compared to the GDP of the U.S. The total market index is tracked by the Wilshire 5000, which is a market-cap-weighted index tracking all U.S. publicly traded companies, comprised of more than 3,000 companies.\n\nJUST IN \ud83d\udea8: Warren Buffett Indicator hits 195%, the highest level in history, surpassing the Dot Com bubble, the Global Financial Crisis, and the 2022 Bear Market pic.twitter.com/SAE5MbHTlY\n\n\u2014 Barchart (@Barchart) July 9, 2024\n\nThe Numbers: Currently, the Wilshire 5000 to GDP ratio sits around 195% according to Barchart, higher than the ratio preceding the dot-com bubble crash as well as the Great Financial Crisis in 2007-2008. In 2000, when internet stocks like Pets.com reached historically speculative levels, the Buffett indicator was around 140%. In 2007, ahead of the subprime mortgage crisis that wreaked havoc on the economy for years, the ratio was around 110%.\n\nTrending:This city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast \u2014 No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.\n\nSo: In today's market, higher interest rates have done little to dampen the valuations of large tech companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) or NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), each trading with forward price-to-earnings rations above 50, well higher than the historical average for S&P 500 companies according to Macrotrends.\n\nBut, projections for earnings growth remains strong, indicating that while companies may look overvalued today, those multiples could come down to earth as earnings continue to grow. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, recently shared a chart on X showing that forward earnings expectations have steadily increased throughout the last few years, potentially helping explain why investors are willing to pay high premiums for stocks at current prices.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Why are stocks up so much this year?\" \ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\udd0e pic.twitter.com/BjfyPmimMs\n\n\u2014 Ryan Detrick, CMT (@RyanDetrick) July 8, 2024\n\nWill the \u2018Buffett Indicator' predict another market crash due to high valuations compared to current GDP numbers?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday as Wall Street was slapped with profit-taking even as inflation showed signs of cooling, with focus now turning to the second quarter earnings season.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,641.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 20,444.25 points by 19:03 ET (23:03 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,123.0 points.\n\nSoft CPI data ramps up Sept rate cut bets\n\nConsumer price index inflation read softer than expected for June, which saw investors ramp up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates from September.\n\nHeadline CPI grew a slower-than-expected 3% year-on-year in June, while core CPI grew 3.3%, also less than expected.\n\nThe reading saw traders pricing in an over 85% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, a sharp jump from the 65% chance seen a day ago, according to CME Fedwatch.\n\nBut the softer inflation, coupled with other middling readings on the U.S. economy in recent weeks sparked some concerns that growth was cooling.\n\nWall St sinks as tech faces profit-taking\n\nBut despite increased optimism over interest rate cuts, Wall Street indexes retreated from record highs on Thursday, hit chiefly by outsized losses in technology shares.\n\nThe losses came as investors collected a measure of recent profits in the sector, which had steadily risen in recent weeks on hype over artificial intelligence.\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 0.8% in aftermarket trade following a 5.6% slump on Thursday.\n\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2% after tumbling 8.5% after a report said the firm\u2019s unveiling of autonomous taxis will be delayed to October from August.\n\nTech was the biggest weight on Wall Street on Thursday, after driving a stellar stock rally over the past few weeks.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% to finish at 5,584.54 points, while the NASDAQ Composite slid 1.9% to 18,288.62 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% 39,753.75 points.\n\nQ2 earnings season begins with banks\n\nMarket focus was now squarely on the second-quarter earnings season, which is set to begin in earnest with a slew of key bank earnings on Friday.\n\nJPMorgan Chase&Co (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo &Company (NYSE:WFC), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) are set to report earnings through the day. Next week, majors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are set to report earnings on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFocus will largely be on whether corporate earnings were impacted by high interest rates and sticky inflation, which were seen causing some cooling in the U.S. economy in the second quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St falls after CPI data; Q2 earnings awaited\n\nBoeing nearing deal to sell 777X jets to Korean Air, sources say\n\nGlobal EV sales up 13% in June, down 7% in Europe, Rho Motion says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The 2020s have been a rollercoaster so far, and who knows what the next ten years could hold for us. However, if we narrow the lens down to just the stock market, it\u2019s been nothing but stellar for the past year and a half.\n\nAlso, the coming years look rosy, at least according to the bulls. Most bulls argue that we already had a soft landing and that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts will give the pandemic\u2019s ripple effects a happy ending.\n\nBears will tell you to hunker down in defensive names or even flee. They see the writing on the wall for growth stocks. In their view, a repeat of the Dot-Com Bust is inevitable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere\u2019s some truth to both sides since the labor market is strong, and artificial intelligence (AI) is contributing to efficiency. On the other hand, rate cuts have aligned with previous recessions.\n\nRegardless, growth stocks are unlikely to disappoint you if you hold them for a decade. They may take a hit in the near term if we enter a recession. However, history has shown that it\u2019s not worth timing the market, and it\u2019s much better to buy and hold. Thus, let\u2019s explore seven solid growth stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) In this photo illustration the Pinduoduo logo seen displayed on a smartphone. PDD stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) still has significant room to run, with its international app Temu taking the America by storm. It was the most downloaded app since Q1 of 2023 and now boasts over 100 million active users in the U.S. alone. With its ultra-low prices, Temu is unlikely to turn away cost-conscious consumers anytime soon.\n\nHowever, Temu is just one growth engine for PDD. The company\u2019s core Pinduoduo app continues to thrive in China. Analysts are incredibly bullish. PDD stock price targets\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRecently, PDD upgraded their 2024 revenue and earnings estimates. Despite having much stronger fundamentals, the stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings, nearly a 50% discount to the Nasdaq 100.\n\nOf course, risks are possible. Escalating U.S.-China tensions and potential tariffs could create headwinds. However, with a foothold in the massive Chinese market and an expanding global presence, I believe PDD is well-positioned for the long haul.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding smartphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is riding the AI wave, and investors are taking notice. The company reported blowout earnings last quarter, with revenue surging 200% year-over-year (YOY) to $3.85 billion. Net income skyrocketed 367% to $402.5 million. This growth is driven not only by AI but also by advanced technologies like cloud computing and edge computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Super Micro Computer is among the most promising and profitable AI plays for early investors. The stock has more than tripled year-to-date (YTD). SMCI is a key beneficiary of the AI boom as a critical server technology supplier to data centers. Some analysts even view it as an \u2018AI proxy\u2019 that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) starts to wane.\n\nDespite the huge run-up, the stock still appears cheap compared to high-flying software names. Super Micro Computer trades at 38 times forward earnings, a bargain considering its triple-digit growth. Of course, the data center industry is cyclical and competitive, so growth projections are more uncertain. But if the AI megatrend has legs, as I believe it does, Super Micro Computer could be a core holding for the next decade-plus.\n\nWall Street is largely bullish, with a consensus price target of $1,066. Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Wedbush all have targets around $830-$890. However, some analysts caution the stock is priced for perfection after the massive rally.\n\nTherefore, Super Micro Computer will likely continue to be a battleground stock. But given its pole position in the AI hardware race, it\u2019s definitely worth having some exposure to.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) is riding high on the cloud computing and data boom megatrends. Recently, the company reported stellar Q1 of 2024 results, with revenue up 27% YOY to $611 million. Also, Datadog is seeing strong growth in large customers, with those spending over $100,000 annually increasing 15% to about 3,340.\n\nWhile most of the AI hype is focused on hardware players like Nvidia, Datadog provides exposure to AI software trends without investing in risky startups or just the Big Tech giants.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Datadog. Morgan Stanley reiterated an overweight rating, citing the company\u2019s ability to gain market share and deliver attractive profit margins. The stock has surged over 20% in the year, though at a $42 billion market cap, Datadog trades at a steep valuation.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m optimistic about Datadog\u2019s prospects. Exercise some caution though, given the lofty expectations baked into the stock price. However, as long as organizations continue rapidly adopting cloud computing, Datadog is poised to be a prime beneficiary.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is riding several powerful megatrends that could position the company for future robust growth. In Q1 of 2024, Duolingo delivered impressive results, with revenue increasing 45% YOY to $167.6 million and adjusted EBITDA nearly tripling. This beat expectations, though the stock still dropped 15% after the report.\n\nI\u2019m optimistic about Duolingo\u2019s prospects. Globalization and widespread internet access are fueling people\u2019s desire to learn about different cultures and connect with the world. Nowhere is this more evident than in developed countries. At the same time, high levels of immigration into the U.S. and Western nations are driving demand for language learning software. In Sweden, for instance, Duolingo has become the go-to place for migrants learning Swedish.\n\nAs these trends accelerate, the global language-learning market is projected to reach $115 billion by 2025. It currently has less than 1% market share, so Duolingo has a massive runway for growth. Analysts seem to agree, with the average rating on the stock at moderate buy.\n\nIn addition, Duolingo\u2019s fundamentals look solid. Daily active users jumped 54% last quarter as the product resonates with learners. Revenue from subscriptions are also compounding fast. growth stocks to buy and hold: DUOL subscription revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith a powerful flywheel effect of product improvements fueling user growth and vice versa, expect Duolingo to sustain its momentum.\n\nBandwidth Inc (BAND) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommunications platform company Bandwidth Inc (NASDAQ:BAND) could be poised for a major recovery in the coming years. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2024 results, with revenue increasing 24% YOY to $171 million. Moreover, management raised their full-year outlook, now expecting $715 million in revenue at the midpoint. Analysts expect its financials to rise sharply in the coming years. BAND financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nBandwidth Inc. is still unprofitable on a GAAP basis and is saddled with a hefty $643.8 million debt load. Nevertheless, I see plenty of reasons for optimism. The company is riding several powerful megatrends in the CPaaS (communications platform as a service) market, which is projected to soar from $12.5 billion in 2022 to $45.3 billion by 2027.\n\nGranted, this is a speculative pick for now. The stock has been hammered, plunging from a peak of nearly $190 in 2021 to about $10 last year, though shares have rebounded to $18 as of writing.\n\nOnce the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, Bandwidth\u2019s growth will really start to shine through to the bottom line. It has $147 million in cash and can handle the losses until rates come down and take off the interest expense burden. It\u2019s worth looking into if you like risk.\n\nPaycom Software (PAYC)\n\nSource: STEFANY LUNA DE LINZY / Shutterstock.com\n\nPaycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) has been on my radar lately, and for good reason.\n\nDespite the stock being down 58.6% over the past year, the company continues to post impressive double-digit revenue growth and rising profits. In their recent Q1 of 2024 earnings report, PAYC delivered revenue of $500 million, up 11% YOY, and adjusted EBITDA of $230 million. While growth has slowed compared to historical levels, I believe the market is underestimating Paycom Software\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nPAYC\u2019s software named Beti allows employees to do their own payroll, and the company is streamlining HR workflows and driving significant ROI for clients. As more businesses rush automation and self-service, expect demand for Paycom\u2019s offerings to accelerate.\n\nAdmittedly, analyst opinions on PAYC are mixed, but it is a good buy at current valuations.\n\nBlock Inc. (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe market has been far too pessimistic on BlockInc. (NYSE:SQ). While the stock is still well off its highs, the fundamentals paint a picture of a company firing on all cylinders. Block Inc. is capitalizing on major fintech megatrends such as digital payments, e-commerce and crypto. Cash App continues to be a growth engine, with inflows per active up 11% in Q1. And the Afterpay acquisition is already bearing fruit, as evidenced by the 25% increase in BNPL gross merchandise value.\n\nIts Q1 of 2024 earnings report beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue is up 19.4% YOY to nearly $6 billion, while EPS of 85 cents trounced estimates by 12 cents.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with 24 buy ratings versus just one sell. The consensus price target of $89 implies nearly 40% upside from current levels. It\u2019s not hard to see why, considering EPS is projected to quadruple over the next decade while revenue could double from 2024 to 2030. SQ financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAs long as Block Inc. keeps executing, I expect the stock to make a sharp move higher, especially once interest rates start coming down.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.8% in the afternoon session as investors seem to be rotating out of large-cap tech stocks that have been winners year-to-date. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are down today.\n\nWe observe that the Russell 2000 Index is up 3%, suggesting that investors could be rotating into smaller stocks. The rotation could have been sparked by today's inflation report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It revealed that CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of June 2024 came in better than expected at 3% year on year (the lowest level in more than three years).\n\nThe recent inflation prints supported the argument that the Fed will start cutting rates this year as the headline figures moved closer to the 2% target.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 16 days ago, when the company gained 6.4% as the stock rebounded after shedding more than $400b in market cap since the previous week. We'd note that there were no specific fundamental reasons driving the move, just as there were no major ones driving the decline in the stock in the previous week or so. The last major fundamental datapoint we had on the company was May 22, 2024, when Nvidia reported Q1'2024 earnings that were quite strong and above expectations.\n\nNvidia is up 166% since the beginning of the year, and at $128.19 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $135.58 from June 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $30,838.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "What do you consider your buy-and-hold stocks? Some investors focus on growth, others lean towards value, and some even bet heavily on trending meme stocks \u2014 but which strategy is optimal?\n\nAs with everything in investing, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all rule for selecting your buy-and-hold stocks. However, for most retail investors with a long-term horizon, certain characteristics should form the backbone of your search. You\u2019ll notice recurring themes if you research these companies deeply enough. Broadly speaking, these potential buy-and-hold stocks combine a proven operational track record with substantial growth, robust financial health, and clear upside potential, making long-term capital appreciation a clear likelihood.\n\nAt the same time, some of these remain speculative plays compared to pure-value investments; this increases the chance of rapid growth and gains while their inherent risk is buffered by the stability of other buy-and-hold stocks, ultimately creating a well-rounded portfolio for the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSay what you will about Elon Musk, but there\u2019s no denying that investors who counted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) among their portfolio\u2019s buy-and-hold stocks had a stellar performance over the years. Just ask the legions of short sellers who bet otherwise and lost billions. Tesla\u2019s next bull run may just be getting started following Musk\u2019s pay package approval, which cements his focus on the firm and is already bearing fruit.\n\nThis shift is already evident just weeks after the decision, with Musk redirecting his AI focus back to Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is constructing a massive GPU warehouse to house over 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, aiming to centralize AI development under Tesla. This follows Tesla\u2019s announcement of a $3 billion to $4 billion investment in AI hardware, signaling Musk and Tesla\u2019s commitment to becoming leaders in AI. Enhanced AI capabilities will significantly contribute to advancing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d addressing the final major obstacle to achieving full self-driving car technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi event on August 8 may prove the final catalyst catapulting Tesla from the (comparatively) lower price range it\u2019s traded at for the past year \u2014 meaning investors looking to buy and hold stocks like Tesla should act soon.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) may not have the flashiest operational model, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its buy-and-hold stock status \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. Visa\u2019s reliable sales streams, operational model, and willingness to adapt to new trends and markets are just some of the reasons Visa stock returned more than 400% over the past decade, doubling the S&P 500\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa owns about 20% of the global cashless payment processing market today, but that doesn\u2019t mean management is content with its current dominance. The opposite is true as Visa is making massive inroads toward new client lists while adopting new technology.\n\nSpecifically, Visa is bringing digital wallets (already popular among consumers) to enterprise and corporate clients to help streamline their spending. Corporate credit is already the largest chunk of global credit utilization, and digital wallet opportunities promise to increase its size further and reward VIsa\u2019s efforts.\n\nMarkel Group (MKL) Markel website homepage MRK stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarkel Group (NYSE:MKL), primarily known as an insurance company, might initially seem like an unconventional pick among buy-and-hold stocks given the sector\u2019s typically tight margins, despite benefiting short-term benefits from bond yields due to their substantial cash reserves. However, there is much more to Markel Group than meets the eye.\n\nOften dubbed the \u201cbaby Berkshire Hathaway\u201d (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), Markel Group, under the leadership of CEO Thomas Gayner, is somewhat modeled after Warren Buffett\u2019s approach at Berkshire. Gayner runs Markel as an insurance company and a large holding company that uses \u201cunderwriting profits to invest in equity, through both publicly traded stocks and ownership stakes in private companies.\u201d\n\nThis strategy paid off handsomely, with Markel achieving a 360% return over the past 20 years, edging out the S&P 500\u2019s 326% gain during the same period.\n\nDespite its seemingly high share price, much of the bearish sentiment around Markel focuses on its core insurance underwriting business, overlooking Gayner\u2019s innovative and successful investment approach. If you consider Gayner\u2019s historical performance and believe in his strategy\u2019s sustainability, Markel could be the biggest opportunity in decades if it goes the way of Berkshire.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of buy-and-hold stocks operating within payment processing, few fintech stocks can beat Block (NYSE:SQ). After a few rough quarters, compounded by wider market unease and a crippling short report that ultimately proved overblown, Block\u2019s most recent earnings report points to renewed strength.\n\nSpecifically, Block\u2019s gross profit improved by more than 20% to hit $2.09 billion, with much of that coming from its Cash App segment, which saw profit climb 25% year-over-year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 20% or better profitability growth, while sales also jumped 20%.\n\nMoreover, like Visa, Block is focusing on the future of finance \u2014 with a big emphasis on its crypto exchange and new blockchain ventures. Earlier this year, Block released its physical hardware crypto wallet, BitKey, to help diversify its customer base beyond those comfortable enough to hold coins in Cash App. Perhaps noting increased consumer concerns following the FTX debacle, Block is rapidly positioning itself as an all-weather crypto player to differentiate itself in the long term.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock finally broke free from its sub-$25 trading range, and many investors are noticing. But, for those paying attention, Palantir always counted itself among the ranks of quality buy-and-hold stocks, even if per-share pricing volatility made short-term trading tough.\n\nPalantir\u2019s biggest strength today is rapid diversification beyond government contracting; government contracts offer decent money and long-term sales, and staking your operational future on just a few clients \u2014 even governmental \u2014 is risky. But Palantir is seeing success compound across its corporate client list, creating a snowball effect as it delivers value to private firms as diverse as Tampa General Hospital, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), AARP, and even Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN).\n\nPalantir\u2019s operational model creates a certain amount of entrenchment and high switching costs; in other words, once a company relies on what Palantir offers, they\u2019re unlikely to move to a competitor. A wider range of corporate clients both diversifies and extends Palantir\u2019s sales streams, compounding Palantir\u2019s status among buy-and-hold stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nFew stocks capture as wide a swath of the sustainable and green energy sectors as Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), making it a top buy and hold stock for sustainability-minded investors.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners holds a diverse portfolio of smaller renewable energy companies worldwide, focusing on long-term value rather than short-term gains. That trait makes it stand out among even the most forward-thinking buy-and-hold stocks. Brookfield\u2019s portfolio includes hydroelectric power, wind, utility-scale solar, and energy distribution solutions. This diversity helps investors to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies in specific sectors while aligning with the broader sustainability movement.\n\nManagement aims for a 12% to 15% total return by enhancing existing assets and securing market deals, creating a long-term compounding effect for buy-and-hold investors. Since Brookfield Renewable\u2019s parent company often deals with distressed debt investments, the current economic climate means plenty of new opportunities for management to set itself up for long-term momentum.\n\nSmaller firms struggling to raise capital or manage debt may find themselves attractive merger and acquisition targets for Brookfield, a trend we\u2019re already seeing accelerate.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime choice for long-term buy-and-hold stocks, combining smart financial management, significant long-term growth potential, and innovative leadership that continues to push boundaries despite its size \u2014 a distinction not as evident in companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategic positioning in the AI sector may be the next catalyst to propel shares higher. While skepticism about more ambitious AI claims is understandable, the technology undeniably challenges traditional search engines and introduces new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft\u2019s existing software suite. Microsoft\u2019s hefty investment in OpenAI, the leading AI firm, secures it a front-row seat and early entrant advantage in developing the next major technological breakthrough.\n\nToday is reminiscent of the early 2000s when search engine technology was on the horizon, but consumers didn\u2019t realize its enormous potential and profitability. Among public companies, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this future potential, making it a top buy-and-hold stock for a forward-thinking investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in MKL.

Although we\u2019re still in the middle of a bull market, it is more of a broad-based rally, higher this time than it was in 2023.\n\nBack then, the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks accounted for virtually all of the market\u2019s gains. This year, although most of those companies are still performing well \u2014 and some like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continue to do very well \u2014 the seven tech giants are not having the same impact.\n\nWell, on the S&P 500 they are, because it is a market capitalization-weighted index. Six of the Magnificent Seven are worth $1 trillion or more (only laggard Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not). That means their movements affect the index more than they do a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt is also why the S&P 500 is up 17% year-to-date and the Dow is up a measly 4%. Yet this offers investors an opportunity. It suggests undervalued Dow stocks may be more prevalent than those on the popular benchmark index.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into the three companies below that may be some of the best undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nGoldman Sachs (GS) In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the background\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is an investment bank in transition. Weighed down by acquisitions in wealth management and installment lending that it thought would diversify its operations, today the financial giant is reorganizing its efforts to concentrate on investment banking, trading, and investment management. It will continue divesting consumer-facing businesses.\n\nGoldman took big writedowns on its home improvement lender GreenSky, which it sold last October. It also scrapped its co-branded credit cards with General Motors (NYSE:GM) while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) terminated its Goldman Sachs card.\n\nThe turnaround effort is working. First-quarter profit exceeded analyst expectations as the investment banking division benefited from increases in underwriting and dealmaking. Last year was a mixed one for mergers and acquisitions. While dealmaking hit a decade low, some of the biggest acquisitions ever took place, including Exxon Mobil\u2019s (NYSE:XOM) purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. Goldman Sachs was the lead advisor on the $60 billion transaction.\n\nThe investment banker\u2019s stock is up 50% over the past year and Wall Street expects earnings to grow 22% annually for the next five years. Trading at just a fraction to those projected growth rates, Goldman Sachs stock is one of the leading undervalued Dow stocks to buy today.\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial conglomerate 3M (NYSE:MMM) has destroyed value for investors for years. Over the past decade, the owner of Post-It Notes and Scotch-brand tape has a total return of just 23% compared to a 190% return by the Dow.\n\nIts malaise culminated in May of this year when this former Dividend King slashed its dividend by more than half. Facing mounting lawsuits over faulty products (made by a company it acquired) and environmental pollution allegations, 3M was forced to conserve cash. But it also spun off its consumer products business Solventum (NYSE:SOLV) to return some value to shareholders and began settling the lawsuits against it.\n\nToday, 3M is a much healthier company financially and the markets approve. Shares are up 9% in 2024 which turned the conglomerate into an undervalued Dow stock worth buying. 3M goes for 12 times earnings estimates and a deeply discounted 11x free cash flow (FCF). With a lower dividend payment, 3M can now support the payout. MMM stock deserves renewed consideration by investors.\n\nDow (DOW) DOW Chemical sign outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is fun to write: chemical stock Dow (NYSE:DOW) is an undervalued Dow stock. Shares trade at 12 times earnings estimates, a fraction of sales and 14x FCF. Dow stock, though, is down 5% this year and off 2% for the last 12 months. Shares remain 27% below the all-time high they hit in 2021.\n\nThe tide is turning for the chemicals company. Demand recovered in the first quarter even though sales were down 9% year-over-year. However, they were up 1% sequentially. Chairman and CEO Jim Fitterling told investors, \u201cWe captured improving demand, maintained pricing, and benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs.\u201d As a result, volumes grew and margins expanded.\n\nBecause chemicals are a commodity and their price tends to move in tandem with Brent crude oil prices, Dow should benefit from Brent prices north of $84 a barrel. That is 5% above the price one year ago. The Energy Information Administration forecasts oil to trade around $89 a barrel in the back half of 2024. It does not expect that to change much next year as it forecasts Brent crude at $88 a barrel.\n\nThe higher prices should help Dow improve its capacity utilization. And with lower natural gas prices in the mix now and going forward, the chemicals stock should also benefit as it lowers its feedstock costs. That points to improving profitability and should have investors putting DOW stock on their buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in MMM, SOLV and XOM stock.

        "content": "Investing.com - In interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Steve Eisman, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, expressed his belief in the continued dominance of US megacap technology shares for years to come. He predicts this trend will be driven by the increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) through consumer electronics.\n\nEisman, known for his successful \"Big Short\" bet against subprime mortgages before the global financial crisis, suggests that consumers' desire for new AI applications on smartphones and personal computers will trigger the \"biggest refresh cycle in history.\" This wave of upgraded device purchases will likely benefit tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, click here to save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nDespite Nvidia's high valuation, Eisman is not concerned. He points out that the company's earnings have tripled, making it a sound investment. Eisman has previously disclosed that he owns a substantial amount of Nvidia shares.\n\nEisman also shared his views on the broader economy, stating that although it's slowing down, the situation is stable. He sees no fundamental reason to short stocks significantly.\n\nReflecting on his past experiences, Eisman said, \"I predicted the end of the world once \u2014 it was pretty awful for everybody. I have no interest in predicting it again and there's no data to show that it's going to happen.\"\n\nRegarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Eisman believes there are times to short the company when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, he concedes that this becomes challenging when investors focus on Tesla's self-driving car and AI ambitions rather than its fundamentals. Eisman clarified that while he doesn't short for his clients, he occasionally does so on a personal basis.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSteve Eisman: Big tech dominance to continue, predicts Trump victory\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Can the Silo AI Acquisition Change AMD's Fate, or Is It a Risky Bet?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD is expanding its AI ecosystem with the announced acquisition of Silo AI for roughly $665 million in cash. The deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, will strengthen AMD\u2019s AI skillset and software expertise. \r\n\r\nAMD has been on an acquisition spree to strengthen its AI ecosystem. In the past 12 months, it has spent $125 million on a dozen of acquisitions. Nod.ai and Mipsology are some other notable acquisitions in the recent past.\r\n\r\nHelsinki, Finland-based Silo AI offers end-to-end AI solutions and boasts a diverse clientele that includes the likes of Allianz, Philips, Rolls-Royce and Unilever. Silo AI has developed open-source large language models, like Poro and Viking, on AMD platforms in addition to its SiloGen model platform.\r\n\r\nAMD\u2019s acquisitiveness is aimed at primarily reducing the technological gap with NVIDIA NVDA in the ongoing race for AI dominance. Silo AI\u2019s team comprises scientists and engineers with extensive experience in developing customized AI models, as well as platforms and solutions for leading enterprises encompassing cloud, embedded and endpoint computing markets. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, Silo AI acquisition may not be enough to solve AMD\u2019s growing problems which include stiff competition from NVIDIA in the race for AI chip dominance and continued weakness in the Embedded and Gaming businesses.\n\nStrong Portfolio Fails to Boost AMD\u2019s Prospects\n\nBoth AMD and NVDA have been the darlings of investors, driven by the massive proliferation of AI that has created a strong demand for GPU chips required to power AI models. The AI space is expected to remain robust with increased spending by cloud computing providers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL. \r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nAMD\u2019s initiatives to expand its portfolio are making it well-positioned to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market. \r\n\r\nNew offerings like the Instinct MI325X accelerator are helping to expand AMD\u2019s footprint in the data center market. AMD has launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs. \r\n\r\nHowever, the challenging macroeconomic environment and rising uncertainty over the upcoming Presidential elections don\u2019t bode well for AMD, given its much smaller size and GPU market share compared to NVIDIA.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA\u2019s strategy to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline intensifies competition for AMD. Moreover, initiatives by tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms to build their own platforms for AI don\u2019t bode well for AMD.\n\nStory continues\n\nSluggish Embedded & Gaming Hurts AMD Prospects\n\nFor second-quarter 2024, the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year over year. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenues are expected to be flat, while the Gaming segment revenues are expected to decline by a significant double-digit percentage.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter Embedded revenues is currently pegged at $847.4 million, indicating a 45.7% year-over-year decline. The consensus mark for Gaming is pegged at $661.94 million, suggesting a massive 165.4% decline.\n\nEmbedded & Gaming Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAMD expects second-quarter 2024 revenues to be $5.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 6% and sequential growth of approximately 4%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.71 billion, indicating 6.54% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 66 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days and suggesting 13.79% year-over-year growth.\n\nEstimate Revision Steady Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nAMD shares have jumped more than 14% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of 12.4% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 4.7%. NVIDIA has gained 7.7% over the same timeframe.\n\nOne Month Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, we believe the recent share price momentum will be short-lived, given the rising fundamental challenges. AMD has a Growth Style Score of D, which makes the stock unattractive for growth-oriented investors. A Value Style Score of F indicates a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nAMD currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which indicates that investors should stay away in the near term.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The PC industry is finally on the path to recovery",
        "content": "The turnaround in the global PC market continues to gain speed as hype around AI PCs grows and enterprise customers start to pick up purchases of laptops and desktops. According to early data from market research firm IDC, the PC market grew 3%, marking the second quarter of growth after a staggering seven consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nWhile that\u2019s higher than the 1.9% growth rival firm Gartner says the market saw in the quarter, both numbers point to a recovery in a sector that was crushed after it saw sales pulled forward at the start of the pandemic, which suppressed sales in subsequent quarters.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the PC market, just like other technology markets, faces challenges in the near term due to maturity and headwinds,\" said IDC group vice president Ryan Reith.\n\n\"However, two consecutive quarters of growth, combined with plenty of market hype around AI PCs and a less sexy but arguably more important commercial refresh cycle, seems to be what the PC market needed. The buzz is clearly around AI, but a lot is happening with non-AI PC purchasing to make this mature market show signs of positivity.\"\n\nIn Q1 2023, Gartner reported that PC shipments collapsed a stunning 30% year over year, before beginning to tick back up in Q2 2023 when the firm reported PC shipments fell 16%. A closer look at the Windows Copilot key. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe declines were a rapid turnaround from the explosive growth the PC industry saw in the early days of the pandemic. Consumers and enterprise customers stuck on their couches for months purchased new systems to work from home and for entertainment. But with so many people buying PCs at once, there were fewer customers in need of new machines in subsequent months, sending sales into a nose dive.\n\nSince then, sales have continued to improve, as consumers have begun to replace the laptops and desktops they purchased in the early months of 2020.\n\nPC market declines hit everything from software vendors like Microsoft (MSFT), which reported Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter of 2023.\n\nIntel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\n\nThe market turnaround comes as the PC industry looks to the AI PC as the next leg of growth for laptop and desktop manufacturers. AI PCs are roughly defined as PCs that come equipped with specialized neural processing units.\n\nStory continues AMD launched its first AI PC desktop chip at CES 2024. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nMicrosoft is marketing AI PCs that include its Copilot technology as Copilot+PCs. It\u2019s a bit of a mouthful, and the company\u2019s launch hasn\u2019t exactly gone as it hoped. Initially, Microsoft was expecting to kick off its Copilot+PC push with a software feature called Recall designed to screenshot virtually everything you do on your computer, making it easier to pick up where you left off and keep you from losing your place while searching the web. But security researchers raised concerns about the app, and Microsoft was forced to pull back on the feature to address any potential issues.\n\nIntel, AMD, and Nvidia are also getting in on the AI PC push, with Intel and AMD launching AI PC chips, and Nvidia noting that PCs running its dedicated graphics chips can easily handle AI PC apps.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is also making a run at the AI PC market, launching its latest PC chip in Microsoft Copilot+PCs including that company\u2019s Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. The chipmaker promises the kind of performance that Apple has managed to squeeze out of its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops, including all-day battery life and exceptional processing power.\n\nThe AI PC market is still new \u2014 Microsoft only launched its Copilot+PCs in May \u2014 and there\u2019s still no sense as to how many users will specifically opt for AI PCs for their capabilities versus how many will them because they\u2019re simply the latest and greatest on the market. Still, the industry is clearly on an upward trajectory, and for PC makers, that\u2019s what matters most. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Jim Cramer: NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA) is \u2018Unrivaled\u2019 in the New Industrial Revolution",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. Since NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a fresh episode of \u201cMad Money\u201d on CNBC said that while investing isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s made even more difficult by \u201cauthentic Wall Street gibberish\u201d and \u201carcane technology.\u201d Cramer said that there\u2019s an \u201centire industry\u201d in Wall Street wanting people to think that investing is hard and \u201cordinary people\u201d cannot do it on their own. Cramer said that many people in the financial industry are just \u201cafter your fees\u201d and they aren\u2019t interested in making money from original investing. Cramer said that hedge fund managers and mutual funds make investing look inaccessible and impenetrable.\n\nCramer said that he\u2019s \u201cpulling back the curtain\u201d and emphasized that investing isn\u2019t \u201crocket science\u201d or \u201cbrain surgery\u201d and you don\u2019t need to go to a business school to understand it. Cramer pitched himself as a \u201ccoach\u201d or a \u201ctranslator\u201d who can explain the meaning of complex financial terms to ordinary people.\n\n\u201cYou can comprehend all the mystical-sounding vocabulary we throw around here as long as you have a translator, a coach like me, who can explain what the darn words mean.\u201d\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) Top Stock in July?\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 186\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program yet again repeated his thesis on NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA), saying \u201cown it don\u2019t trade it.\u201d Cramer said when the second quarter of this year started, there was a \u201cwidely-held\u201d belief that the stock had \u201cmoved too much\u201d and it was time to do some selling.\n\n\u201cI heard that several times a day during our network.\u201d\n\nCramer said that despite its $3 trillion market cap, NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0is \u201cunrivaled in its ability to usher in this new industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nCramer said that he\u2019s been lauding for NVIDIA Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u00a0for over a decade.\n\nDan Ives is one of the biggest NVDA bulls on the Street. Recently, responding to Newstreet Research\u2019s downgrade of NVDA, Ives on Twitter wrote:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe cannot disagree more with this negative Nvidia call as discussed on\u00a0@LastCallCNBC\u00a0last night as the AI Revolution is just starting in our view being led by Nvidia and the Godfather of AI Jensen in this 9 pm party.\u201d\n\nThere is no shortage of Wall Street analysts calling NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) a top dog in the AI race. Recently, Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer joined the NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chorus, raising the chipmaker\u2019s price target to $150 from $110 following the 10-1 stock split.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks accounting for a huge chunk of the total market returns, thanks to its AI-fueled rally that seems to have no end in sight.\n\nNVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) latest product announcements and its plans revealed at the Computex 2024 show that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has much more in its arsenal to power its growth engine. Analysts like NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shift to new AI architecture known as Rubin (R100) and think its powerful H100 and Blackwell chips easily beat competitors.\n\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) will start shipping H200 in the second half of this year. At its GTC conference NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) revealed three accelerators \u2013 B200, GB200 and GB200 NVL72. All of these products provide growth catalysts for NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares and justify its P/E multiple of 71, given NVIDIA Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) growth expectation of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Based on 2026 EPS estimate set by Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is trading at a forward P/E multiple of 35.74, which makes the stock\u2019s valuation attractive given the growth catalysts it has.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSimply not owning\u00a0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was a key contributor to the relative underperformance of the Fund against its Benchmark. The Wall Street Journal even published a recent article with the title \u2018No Nvidia in Your Portfolio? You\u2019re Just Toast\u2019. While that is a little melodramatic, it is rare for one company to have such an outsized impact on index returns.\n\nWe readily admit that we underestimated the speed and scale with which Nvidia has been able to monetise its leading position in supporting the growth of AI. We have refreshed our financial analysis and while our valuation of the business has increased materially, we continue to view the current share price as providing an unattractive risk adjusted return in most scenarios. We appreciate the business has surprised to the upside in the past and we continue to follow Nvidia closely.\u201d\n\nOverall, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Hot Analyst Upgrades That Are Moving Stocks This Summer",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has continued to receive bullish forecasts from market analysts, including recent analyst upgrades. Some suggest the index could reach a target of 6,100 by the end of the year. The optimism is grounded in the index\u2019s foundation of earnings growth, with additional support from favorable inflation news and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nThis \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario has reinforced the \u201cnew normal\u201d for three years, indicating that inflation is cooling. Analysts project that this environment will support the S&P 500\u2019s return to earnings growth, which is anticipated to accelerate in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAnalysts are raising their earnings estimates for the S&P 500, contributing to the index\u2019s upward trajectory. The technology sector, particularly companies classified within the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d continues to lead the market, buoyed by their involvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWedbush analysts forecast a further 15% rise in the S&P 500, driven by the expanding applications of AI and a resultant broadening of the market for tech leaders. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognized as enterprise AI industry frontrunners, along with Apple, are expected to capitalize on AI for revenue growth and margin expansion.\n\nKey reports from Microsoft and other prominent tech companies are scheduled for mid-to-late July, while NVIDIA and semiconductor stocks will follow in August. These reports could propel the index to new highs and sustain a rally through the summer and beyond the technical target of 6,100, with Wedbush\u2019s more optimistic target around 6,250.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal\u2019s (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock rating was raised from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cPositive\u201d at Susquehanna following analyst upgrades. The upgrade reflects PayPal\u2019s strategic focus on profitable growth, as outlined in its recent Annual Incentive Plan update for 2024.\n\nPayPal is focusing on growing transaction margin dollars, a central part of its strategy. Susquehanna has highlighted several key initiatives. These include adopting better pricing discipline at Braintree, a PayPal service.\n\nThe company also plans to offer improved merchant services. This provides security, foreign exchange, and advertising through \u201cPayPal Advanced Offers.\u201d For consumers, PayPal aims to boost brand relevance. It will introduce stacked rewards with \u201cPayPal CashPass\u201d and smart receipts.\n\nPayPal wants to grow its cross-border business with small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) through the PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP). A new feature, \u201cFastlane,\u201d aims to increase PayPal\u2019s market share during the holiday season. Susquehanna\u2019s analysis suggests that PayPal will perform better than expected. This includes TMDs and adjusted EBIT dollars in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRosenblatt lifted its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy,\u201d accompanied by a significant increase in the price target to $260 from the previous $196, marking one of the notable analyst upgrades this period. This optimism stems from Apple\u2019s strong long-term performance, surpassing the S&P 500 with a 60.79% increase over three years and a remarkable 340.19% gain over five years.\n\nA recent survey in the United States highlights privacy in AI as a crucial demand among consumers. Analysts point out that Apple\u2019s AI focuses on privacy more than Android. They believe this difference could boost Apple\u2019s market share.\n\nBrokers stand to gain from investments in larger cloud service providers. However, they face different cost pressures than these providers. Rosenblatt has increased its price target for Apple\u2019s stock by $64, which shows that the firm expects Apple\u2019s stock performance to improve.\n\nMoreover, analysts have noted Apple\u2019s strategy to incorporate privacy into its AI services. This strategy gives Apple a competitive advantage. It could lead to financial benefits for the company. This upgrade comes at a time when consumers prioritize AI and privacy in their technology choices.\n\nSAP (SAP) SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, California\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBMO Capital Markets adjusted its stance on SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), elevating the stock from \u201cMarket Perform\u201d to \u201cOutperform\u201d and increasing the price target to $237 from the previous $218. This change, part of recent analyst upgrades, reflects a more optimistic outlook on the software giant\u2019s future performance.\n\nThe firm has updated its rating based on confidence in SAP\u2019s future bookings and revenues. This confidence comes from SAP\u2019s success in moving its large, steady customer base to the cloud.\n\nIn addition, BMO Capital\u2019s analysts stress that SAP\u2019s current cloud backlog and Cloud ERP growth are crucial for success. They have also raised the price target to $237. This change shows their expectation for SAP\u2019s ongoing financial growth.\n\nThe analysts highlight that SAP is on track to hit significant financial goals. Specifically, they aim for \u20ac8 billion in free cash flow by fiscal year 2025. The positive view of SAP also connects to its strategic moves in the cloud sector. These moves should boost the stock\u2019s performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has been the hottest sector in the stock market. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, it has been a race to develop the best and smartest generative AI platforms. Bloomberg Intelligence issued a report that potentially valued the generative AI industry at $1.3 trillion by 2032.\u00a0The AI hardware sector has exploded in value with every major tech company scrambling to buy high-powered GPUs. Semiconductor stocks have led the massive Nasdaq and S&P 500 rally over the past year. Over the past twelve months, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has gained more than 54%. Yet there could now be newly risky AI stocks.\n\nMany of these AI stocks have become overvalued and diverge from their fundamentals. At their current values, it\u2019s hard to justify chasing them after rallying for over a year. These three AI stocks flash danger signs and should be avoided at their current multiples.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYears ago, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the king of the chip industry. However, a drop in PC demand and being replaced as the chip provider for Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Macbook computers sent Intel into a downward spiral. While other chip stocks have flourished, shares of INTC are down by more than 30% in 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSome believed that Intel would be boosted after a deal with the US government. The agreement saw Intel receive $8.5 billion in funding to advance its AI chip technology. Despite this, Intel continues to lose ground in its core CPU business. Chip-rivals AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and ArmHoldings (NASDAQ:ARM) are eating away at Intel\u2019s market share after creating CPUs with superior performance and speed.\n\nAs a result, Intel is showing a negative revenue growth CAGR over the past five years. They are one of the only chip companies with negative growth in recent years. Comparatively, AMD has a five-year revenue CAGR of 30%, and ARM has a three-year CAGR of 17%. Intel is still trading at nearly 30x forward earnings, even with a five-year net income CAGR of -28%. The stock is too richly valued for its declining growth as it continues falling behind its peers and into a category of risky AI stocks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNo stock has been as front and center for the AI revolution as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). I outlined my views on Nvidia a couple of weeks ago, and thus far, my thesis for calling Nvidia\u2019s peak has been playing out. Shares of NVDA are up by nearly 200% over the past year of trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\u2019s recent 10-for-one stock split not only continued the stock\u2019s snowball but also made shares more accessible to retail investors. Those left out of the stock\u2019s historic one-year rally FOMO\u2019d into the stock at the top. Nvidia also faces the threat of homegrown GPUs from companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and cheaper domestic offerings in China. Through its Made in 2025 policy, China plans to produce 70% of its chips domestically by the year 2025.\n\nThere is no denying that the company\u2019s recent growth has been impressive. Analysts have a current average price target of $119.32 and the stock even received a downgrade from a rating of Buy to Neutral by New Street Research. Nvidia will not continue to grow its revenue at a five-year CAGR of nearly 50%. With shares trading at 40x sales, any decline in revenue growth will result in the stock becoming increasingly overvalued. Nvidia is not the only way to gain exposure to AI.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot many people think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as an AI company, yet. What was once the most popular stock on the market has struggled in 2024, only recently bringing their year-to-date returns above water. After gaining nearly 30% in the first week of July, the stock has returned 1.2% in 2024 to shareholders.\n\nMuch of Tesla\u2019s long-term potential revolves around AI-based initiatives like their Robotaxi and Optimus robots. Tesla Bulls also believes in the future of their FSD technology as well as public listings of Elon Musk\u2019s other companies like SpaceX. But most, if not all, of these initiatives are a long way off from being a reality and some may never even come to fruition. Tesla vehicles are the best-selling EVs on the planet yet the market is pricing Tesla as more than just an automaker.\n\nEven if Tesla were a full AI company, the stock now trades at a sky-high valuation. At 101x forward earnings, Tesla trades at double Nvidia\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio. There is a future where Tesla is a leader in AI technology and software. Until we see any of these play out and hit the market, Tesla has to be considered an automaker more than an AI leader and thus one of the risky AI stocks on the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que held a LONG position in AMZN.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) In The Context Of Other Processors and Graphics Chips Stocks\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q1. Today, we are looking at processors and graphics chips stocks, starting with Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC).\n\nThe biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles.\n\nThe 9 processors and graphics chips stocks we track reported an ok Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.6%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 4.7% below consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, but processors and graphics chips stocks have performed well, with the share prices up 14.4% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q1: Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC)\n\nA global leader in its category, Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a semiconductor designer specializing in customer-programmable chips that enhance CPU performance for intensive tasks such as machine learning.\n\nLattice Semiconductor reported revenues of $140.8 million, down 23.6% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decline in its operating margin.\n\nJim Anderson, president and CEO, said, \"First quarter 2024 results came in as expected and reflect the near-term impact of cyclic industry headwinds. Despite near-term headwinds, the Company is well-positioned for the long-term as we execute on the largest product portfolio expansion in our history. \" Lattice Semiconductor Total Revenue\n\nLattice Semiconductor delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "History Says These 3 AI Stocks Could Be Big Winners in the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The stock market's rally shows no signs that it will be ending anytime soon. Investors remain bullish on artificial intelligence (AI), and with the possibility that the Fed will cut interest rates later this year, there could still be catalysts that drive stock prices higher in the months ahead.\n\nIf you're looking for AI-related stocks that could do well in the latter half of the year, consider Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). These companies have historically done well during second halves, and they could be good buys right now.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia is an easy pick for investors these days simply because the company is at the forefront of just about anything related to AI. The company's powerful GPUs put it in an excellent position to keep benefiting from rising AI-related expenditures. And it's still innovating. Earlier this year, Nvidia unveiled its new Blackwell chips, which will be its best and most efficient yet for training AI models.\n\nThe company generated nearly $40 billion in free cash flow over its past four reported quarters, and it has plenty of resources at its disposal to continue investing in its business and enhancing its products and services even further. That's why many analysts and investors remain bullish on the company, even though its market cap now tops $3.3 trillion.\n\nHistorically, Nvidia has done well in the latter part of the year. Here's a look at its second-half returns over the past 10 years.\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 33.1% 17.1% (3.6%) 47% 37.5% 43.3% (43.7%) 33.9% 127.1% 63.9% 8.1%\n\nSource: YCharts.\n\nThere have been some big Q3 and Q4 moves for Nvidia in the past, but I wouldn't hold out hope for another scorching performance in the latter half of 2024 simply because the stock's valuation is already high. But with many catalysts still out there, this is an easy AI stock to justify buying and holding.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, or AMD, isn't nearly as popular as Nvidia, but it could make for an underrated AI investment. The company was a bit late to the AI chip game, but its new hardware entries are solid. Tech giants including Microsoft and Meta Platforms plan to make use of these lower-priced alternatives to Nvidia's chips.\n\nSome companies may also want to buy AMD chips simply to reduce their dependence on a single supplier. The proof will eventually be in the results, which so far have been a bit underwhelming. During the first quarter, AMD's revenue rose by just 2% year over year to $5.5 billion. But if demand for its AI chips proves to be strong, the second half could indeed be a good one for AMD. Here's how its stock has done in the latter halves of previous years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 30.2% 29.4% (15.3%) 53.2% 74.3% 51% 23.2% (17.6%) 120.6% 19.6% (36.3%)\n\nAMD averages a return of more than 30% in the second half, which is only slightly lower than Nvidia's gains. Investors who want to diversify their semiconductor positions beyond Nvidia or who are concerned about its high valuation may want to pick up AMD, which certainly has the potential to post some strong results in upcoming quarters.\n\nTesla\n\nTesla shares are up just 3% so far this year, and that's with the help of a recent rally. The company is a leading electric vehicle (EV) maker, and automation is a big part of its business, but it has also been working on robotics and other AI technologies. CEO Elon Musk dreams big, so to label Tesla as just an automotive stock would miss the big picture.\n\nFor now, however, conditions in the EV market are going to heavily influence how the stock performs. Both macroeconomic and company-specific headwinds have been weighing on Tesla, at least in the near term. But it recently reported better-than-expected delivery numbers for the second quarter, which has helped ignite some bullishness around the stock again. That may suggest that its financial results for Q2, due to be reported later this month, will be better than feared. In Q1 2024, the company's revenue declined by 9% to $21.3 billion and its operating income plummeted by 56% to less than $1.2 billion.\n\nBut if its upcoming earnings show improvement and Tesla's robotaxi event scheduled for August proves to be a positive catalyst, investors could have multiple reasons to feel bullish about the stock. And consider Tesla's track record for the back half of the year:\n\nAverage 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 28.5% (5.1%) (45.1%) 55.5% 226.8% 87.2% (3%) (13.9%) 0.7% (10.5%) (7.4%)\n\nSource: yCharts.\n\nTesla isn't nearly as consistent as AMD or Nvidia. It's had some tough years. But it also shows that given the proper catalysts, Tesla is has the potential for large swings in value that could make the second half a winner for investors.\n\nFor AI investors and Musk fans, the stock's reduced valuation could present a timely opportunity to buy it to hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist Before They Soar by More Than 100%, According to Consensus Wall Street Estimates",
        "content": "Since the launch of OpenAI's famous chatbot ChatGPT, artificial intelligence (AI) seems to have taken the world by storm. AI technologies are being increasingly adopted across a host of industries including automotive, healthcare, finance, and retail to improve operational efficiencies, productivity, decision-making, and overall customer experience. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market is expected to balloon from $621.2 billion in 2024 to nearly $2.74 trillion in 2032.\n\nAI is not a passing trend. With this transformative technology impacting numerous aspects of our daily lives, it has also emerged as a major investment theme. Many AI-powered stocks have already seen dramatic gains in the past couple of years.\n\nHowever, investors now need to pick stocks that can continue to grow in the coming years, based on their superior technologies and strong fundamentals. Here's why Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) fit the bill.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia has emerged as a major enabler and beneficiary of the generative AI revolution. Major cloud infrastructure providers, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and governments worldwide are using the company's accelerated computing solutions to power the AI infrastructure required for training and inferencing large language models. The economics of using Nvidia's chips have proven to be quite appealing. According to a company presentation at the Bank of America Securities 2024 Global Technology Conference, for every $1 invested in Nvidia's GPUs for training large language models, cloud service providers will earn back $5 over four years. The return on investment is even better for AI inferencing, where $1 invested in GPUs should yield $7 over four years.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company now expects demand for its cutting-edge H200 chips and Blackwell systems to outpace supply well into fiscal 2025 (which began Jan. 29), despite ongoing investments in capacity expansions.\n\nNvidia's AI-optimized GPUs and CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem have already played critical roles in AI breakthroughs such as transformer models, unsupervised learning, and the large language models of customers such as Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and even some AI start-ups. The company has positioned itself as a \"full-stack AI platform\" by providing end-to-end AI infrastructure (chips, software, high-speed networking components, servers) to clients to enable them to build and deploy \"AI factories\" (next-generation data centers for AI production) at scale. Furthermore, the company is focused on expanding its addressable markets beyond data centers into areas such as fully self-driving vehicles and robotics.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile no one can reliably predict the future, we can make reasonable forecasts about Nvidia's growth trajectory. Analysts' consensus estimate is that its revenues will quadruple from $60.9 billion in its fiscal 2024 to $248 billion in its fiscal 2030. The company is trading at an elevated price-to-sales multiple of about 40. Assuming that multiple reverts to its three-year average of about 28.6, we can expect the company's market capitalization to be approximately $7 trillion in 2030. That would be more than double Nvidia's current market cap of $3.15 trillion.\n\nPalantir Technologies\n\nData mining and AI specialist Palantir's stock price has risen at an impressive pace in the past year, propelled mainly by the robust adoption of its large language model-powered Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) by its commercial clients. AIP is proving to be a game-changer and is playing a major role in enabling clients to mine unstructured data from varied sources such as Slack messages, PDFs, text messages, email, audio, and images and analyze it to come up with structured suggestions for actions. The company's \"boot camp\" based go-to-market strategy and its \"Build with AIP\" initiative (which includes reference materials and tutorials to help clients build AI solutions) are driving the adoption of AIP.\n\nSince the company's founding, government agencies have been Palantir's core clientele. Recently, though, its commercial business has been growing rapidly. In the first quarter, its U.S. commercial revenues soared 68% year over year while government revenues grew by only 8%. However, while it tends to be lumpy, government business is highly sticky and forms a stable foundation for Palantir. The company also secured a $178.4 million contract from the U.S. Army to develop and deliver a deep-sensing system under the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) program. This agreement has established Palantir as the first \"software prime\" to have a direct contract with the U.S. Army for a hardware project. This could lead to even more opportunities for Palantir in the defense sector.\n\nPalantir is already profitable on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis and is free cash flow positive. The company ended the first quarter with $3.9 billion cash on its books -- sufficient to fund many of its ongoing growth initiatives.\n\nThe consensus forecast from analysts is that Palantir's revenues will almost quadruple from $2.22 billion in 2023 to $7.96 billion in 2030. The stock currently trades at a price-to-sales multiple of about 27. Assuming that the multiple over time reverts to its three-year average of 19.3, we can expect that in 2030 its market capitalization will be around $153.6 billion -- more than double its current market capitalization of $61.6 billion.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Expected to More Than Double Investor's Money, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "When the internet started to become mainstream three decades ago, the growth arc for businesses in America and around the globe completely changed. After decades of patiently waiting, Wall Street and investors have identified what they believe is the next breakthrough innovation that's going to alter the growth trajectory for corporate America: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI relies on software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. What makes this technology so appealing is the capacity for AI software and systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention or oversight. This effectively gives AI utility in virtually all sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe addressable long-term potential of artificial intelligence isn't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Most price targets from Wall Street pundits and financial institutions point to upside for market-leading AI stocks. But this doesn't mean the outlook for all AI stocks is equal.\n\nWhile most pundits expect the hardware kingpin of AI, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), to increase in value over the coming year, high-water price targets from select Wall Street analysts suggest two other AI stocks could more than double investor's money in the coming 12 months and leave Nvidia in the dust.\n\nWall Street's leading artificial intelligence stock may be headed for a bumpy ride\n\nAmong the more than three dozen analysts and pundits that have weighed in on Nvidia, none is more optimistic about its future than Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann.\n\nFollowing the completion of Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 stock split in early June, Mosesmann increased his and his firm's price target on the company to $200 per share from $140. This implies a valuation of nearly $5 trillion and would result in shares gaining an additional 59% from where they ended on July 5.\n\nMosesmann's lofty price target is based on Nvidia retaining its dominance in two key facets of the AI revolution. The first being its monopoly like market share of AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs). The analysts at TechInsights found that Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs that shipped were shipped in 2023. With clear-cut compute advantages and a backlog of next-generation GPU architecture waiting in the wings (Blackwell and Rubin), Mosesmann anticipates Nvidia will be the go-to hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nMosesmann also expects Nvidia to reap the rewards of its CUDA platform, which is the toolkit developers use to build large language models. This software perfectly aligns with Nvidia's hardware monopoly to keep AI-focused businesses locked within its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this overwhelming euphoria surrounding Nvidia, the path forward for the company should be significantly bumpier than the previous 18 months.\n\nFor example, competition is cropping up at a rapid pace. In addition to fighting back against external AI-GPU developers, all four of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI chips for their data centers. Even if Nvidia's chips maintain their compute advantage, the sheer presence of additional AI-GPUs will minimize the scarcity that sent the price of Nvidia's GPUs into the stratosphere and weigh down its margins.\n\nWhat's more, history doesn't agree with a majority of Wall Street analysts. Including the advent of the internet, every next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through a bubble. Since no company has more directly benefited from the rise of AI than Nvidia, it would, presumably, be the likeliest to get clobbered if and when the AI bubble bursts.\n\nAlthough Nvidia's path forward could be bumpy, a pair of Wall Street analysts believe two other AI stocks can run circles around this artificial intelligence leader over the next year. Image source: Nio.\n\nNio: Implied upside of 116%\n\nThe first AI stock that has the ability to leave Nvidia in the dust, at least on a return basis over the next year, is China-based electric-vehicle (EV) maker Nio(NYSE: NIO). According to Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao, Nio can reach $10 per share, which would represent an increase of 116% from where shares ended on July 5.\n\nOne of the catalysts fueling Hsiao's optimism is Nio's rapid growth in production and deliveries. In particular, Nio has been averaging around 5,000 orders per week, or in the neighborhood of 20,000 deliveries per month. Moving past the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to stringent lockdowns in China, has unraveled the supply chain kinks that had previously held back Nio's production expansion.\n\nTo add to this point, Nio has completed the transition of its fleet to its new NT 2.0 platform. This new platform incorporates a number of advanced driver assistance system upgrades, including autonomous driving capabilities, which is one aspect of Nio's AI ties. Since transitioning to NT 2.0, demand for Nio's EVs has picked up.\n\nHsiao and his team are also excited about the 2024 launch of Nio's second vehicle brand, known as Onvo. Whereas Nio has predominantly focused on higher-earning consumers with its existing lineup, Onvo is a family oriented battery-EV brand with a lower price point that can be a more direct competitor to the likes of Tesla in China.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that it's swimming in capital. The company closed out the March quarter with approximately $6.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments. This gives Nio ample runway to introduce new EVs and ramp up production.\n\nThe caveat to all of the above is that building a car company from the ground up is no easy task. Nio is still burning cash and not particularly close to generating a profit. While Onvo and its battery-as-a-service subscription might be able to lift margins, Nio remains a work-in-progress that'll require patience from its shareholders.\n\nBaidu: Implied upside of 102%\n\nThe second artificial intelligence stock expected to more than double investor's money and leave Nvidia eating its dust is yet another China-based company, Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU). According to analyst Fawne Jiang of Benchmark, Baidu has a path to $180 per share -- a 102% gain from its closing price on July 5 -- over the next 12 months.\n\nBaidu is best-known for its market-leading internet search engine. Based on data from GlobalStats, the company's search engine accounted for about a 53% share of internet search in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product in June. With few exceptions, Baidu has controlled a 50% to 85% monthly share of internet search in China dating back 10 years.\n\nAs the go-to internet search engine in China, it's often able to command substantial ad-pricing power from businesses. Although China's bounce-back from the COVID-19 pandemic has been filled with more potholes than initially anticipated, it's tough to envision Baidu struggling for long when it retains a clear moat in advertising.\n\nHowever, it's Baidu's ancillary AI operations that could be its biggest growth driver for the remainder of the decade (if not well beyond). Baidu's AI Cloud is the fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform in China, based on total spending. Enterprise spending on cloud services is in its early stages of ramping up, and cloud-service margins provide far more pop for Baidu than advertising margins.\n\nAdditionally, Baidu is the parent of Apollo Go, the world's leading autonomous ride-hailing service. As of April 19, Apollo Go had surpassed 6 million cumulative rides since its inception.\n\nSimilar to Nio, Baidu is also sitting on quite the treasure chest of available capital. It ended the first quarter with around $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments at its disposal. Given Baidu's forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 7.5, the risk-versus-reward profile for the company would certainly favor upside.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "TSM Stock: Is There a Better Mega-Cap Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC, is one of the best-rated mega-cap stocks by analysts on TipRanks. It\u2019s rated a Strong Buy, with 10 Buy ratings and no Sell or Hold ratings. However, the stock has surged since I last covered it on April 29, and despite several positive catalysts, I\u2019m only somewhat bullish on TSM, with the valuation becoming increasingly stretched. Therefore, it may not be the best opportunity out there despite the Strong Buy consensus rating.\n\nTSMC Surges\n\nSince I last covered TSMC stock, it has surged 38%. That\u2019s just in eight weeks. The stock has been pushed higher by investors\u2019 insatiable demand for companies involved in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as well as several bullish analyst updates.\n\nThis built on stronger delivery figures in the spring, with a 60% surge in April sales to $7.3 billion. That\u2019s a huge increase in anyone\u2019s books. TSMC had already registered a 34.3% increase in revenue growth in March. Unsurprisingly, this was fueled by the relentless demand for AI semiconductors.\n\nThe Taiwanese company\u2019s share price has also benefited from its strategic partnerships in recent months, including with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). TSMC is the exclusive producer of Nvidia\u2019s most advanced training chips, which are continuing to generate exceedingly robust demand, according to Wall Street analysts.\n\nMoreover, recent data put to bed concerns that hyperscale demand would dip during the transition between Nvidia\u2019s current Hopper series products and its upcoming Blackwell series products. The graphics processing units used in the Blackwell architecture are manufactured using a custom-built 4nm TSMC processor.\n\nGeopolitics and Geography Remain Issues\n\nTSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, faces significant geographic concentration risk, and this has long been a concern for investors. Taiwan\u2019s susceptibility to natural disasters, particularly earthquakes, poses a threat to TSMC\u2019s operations, as was demonstrated earlier in 2024. Additionally, escalating tensions with China, which asserts sovereignty over Taiwan, continue to amplify geopolitical risks.\n\nIn response, TSMC is diversifying its manufacturing footprint by constructing and ramping up new foundries in Japan, the U.S., and Europe. This strategic expansion reduces the concentration risk associated with Taiwan\u2019s geopolitics and geography.\n\nHowever, building and operating fabs (semiconductor manufacturing facilities) overseas incurs higher costs due to varying regulatory environments, labor costs, and supply chain logistics. Moreover, Taiwan offers huge economies of scale as a global foundry, and this isn\u2019t being strategically utilized when building fabs overseas. Consequently, customers are likely to face premium pricing for chip production in these regions, particularly in the U.S. and Germany.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC\u2019s Evolving Market and Margins\n\nThe AI revolution has significantly influenced TSMC\u2019s market, driving demand for smaller, high-end processors and chips. This is because AI applications require more advanced processing capabilities. This trend is particularly evident in the 3nm and 5nm segments, which comprised 9% and 37% of TSMC\u2019s FQ1\u201924 revenues, respectively.\n\nThe Taiwanese chip giant has already raised prices moderately, buoyed by the fully booked 3nm capacity through 2026. This price adjustment also aligns with TSMC\u2019s goal of maintaining a long-term gross margin of 53%.\n\nMoving forward, analysts have suggested that more price hikes could be on the table with the cost of electricity, materials, chemicals, gases, and other variables rising in Taiwan. Rising costs are expected to impact gross margins by up to 70 basis points from FQ2\u201924, while the conversion of 5nm tools to support 3nm demand has already impacted margins by 200 basis points.\n\nTSMC\u2019s Valuation Is Getting Stretched\n\nTSMC used to be dirt cheap. I held the stock for some time, and it was trading in line with the average price-to-earnings for the downtrodden FTSE 100 Index. However, it\u2019s now looking a bit more expensive at 29.3x forward earnings and with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.21x (1.0x or lower is generally seen as undervalued). While this PEG ratio is cheap for the sector, it all depends on the discount we attribute to TSMC\u2019s geographical challenges.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for TSM Stock?\n\nOn TipRanks, TSM comes in as a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average TSMC stock price target is $182.56, implying 4.44% downside potential.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that all share price targets have been above the share price at the time of issue \u2014 hence why all the ratings are Buys. The last five ratings have share price targets in excess of the current share price.\n\nThe Bottom Line on TSMC Stock\n\nI remain somewhat bullish on TSMC stock. However, I believe the valuation metrics are starting to become a little stretched when taking into account the geopolitical and geographical issues that the companies face. To some extent, I think investors are electing to discard this vital consideration, which marks a stark change from 18 months ago when it was front and center.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Summer Zhen\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hedge funds hunting for artificial intelligence-related stock market bargains are rushing into South Korea's chipmakers, betting a new wave of demand for high-end memory chips and government spending makes them more valuable.\n\nBritain's Man Group, Singapore's FengHe Fund Management and Hong Kong's CloudAlpha Capital Management and East Eagle Asset Management are among the hedge funds seeking AI exposure in Asia that are looking to South Korean behemoths such as SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, which have so far lagged the sector's rally.\n\n\"If we consider Nvidia the king of the AI story, then Hynix is the queen,\" said Matt Hu, chief investment officer of $4 billion FengHe, which has been buying Hynix and Samsung this year.\n\nFengHe and other hedge fund investors believe the AI frenzy over the past year that trebled the value of U.S.-listed Nvidia's shares to more than $3 trillion has left behind stocks such as Hynix relative to more popular Asian AI players such as Taiwan's TSMC.\n\nBut the spotlight is turning to South Korean chipmakers as technology firms in the generative AI race scurry to secure high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips manufactured primarily by Hynix, Samsung and U.S.-based Micron Technology.\n\nHynix is the top supplier of advanced HBM memory chips to Nvidia. FengHe's Hu estimates Hynix receives a larger proportion of its revenue from Nvidia than TSMC does, but Hynix trades at 9 times its 12-month forward earnings versus 23 times for TSMC.\n\nThere are other broader tailwinds to these shares, such as the South Korean government's 26 trillion won ($19 billion) support package for the chip industry and its new 'Corporate Value-up Programme', along the lines of similar efforts in Japan and China to improve shareholder returns.\n\nThe rush of hedge fund cash into South Korea's AI sector helped the benchmark KOSPI index register its best month in seven months in June. South Korean stocks attracted the strongest inflows among Asia emerging markets so far this year, and their biggest inflows since 2008, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe rewards of being invested in South Korea outweigh the big risks, hedge funds say, namely pressure from a depreciating Korean won and restrictions on short-selling of shares in the local market.\n\nKOSPI is trading at 10 times 12-month forward earnings, compared with Taiwan's 18 times and Japan's 15 times.\n\nMORE MEMORY\n\nSamsung and Hynix account for about 30% of KOSPI by market capitalisation.\n\nWhile Hynix shares are up more than 70% this year, Samsung is up only 12% and the overall KOSPI nearly 9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond HBM chips, scarcity in the supply of broader memory chips has further bolstered South Korean suppliers. Samsung said last week it expected a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, thanks to rising chip prices.\n\nSumant Wahi, a portfolio manager at Man Group focusing on technology stocks, expects prices of traditional Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips to rise too because the chip industry has shifted too much capacity to manufacturing HBM.\n\n\"There's definitely an opportunity there,\" he said.\n\nPierre Hoebrechts, head of macro research at East Eagle Asset Management, expects Samsung to catch up in the second half due to its significant underperformance compared to TSMC this year.\n\nThe South Korean AI theme is also broadening beyond chipmakers. Chris Wang, a portfolio manager at tech-focused CloudAlpha Capital Management, has invested in electricity equipment maker HD Hyundai Electric this year, betting the stock will benefit from the spurt in power consumption. Its shares are up 333% since January.\n\n\"Korea has the potential to sell more semiconductor equipment, cooling systems and even consumer electronics along with the growing AI ecosystem,\" said Simon Woo, Asia-Pacific technology research coordinator at BofA Securities.\n\nThe long-running Sino-U.S. technology war also ensures China keeps using South Korea's advanced memory chips, given Chinese chipmakers have so far been unable to compete while under U.S. export bans, Woo added.\n\n(Reporting by Summer Zhen; Additional reporting by Rae Wee in Singapore and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Technology stocks in Asia rose on Thursday, with chipmakers in the lead as strong monthly revenue figures from TSMC drummed up optimism over artificial intelligence-driven demand.\n\nTSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) rose nearly 2% in Taiwan trade and hit a record high of T$1,070.0, as the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker clocked revenue of T$207.87 billion ($6.4 billion) in June, bringing its second quarter revenue to T$673.51 billion, which beat market expectations.\n\nThe strong revenue came as the chipmaking giant likely benefited from increased demand for chips in the AI industry, as more companies moved to ramp up AI development and build chip infrastructure to support their efforts.\n\nThe strong revenue figures saw investors positioning for a bumper second-quarter earnings report from TSMC next week. The firm will report its second quarter earnings on July 18.\n\nAsian tech stocks, particularly chipmakers, advanced on Thursday, tracking gains in TSMC. Optimism over TMSC also sparked overnight gains in U.S. chipmakers, with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), TSMC\u2019s biggest customer, rising over 2%.\n\nIn Asia, memory chip SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which has been tied closely to the AI industry, rose over 3%.\n\nJapan\u2019s Sony Corp (TYO:6758) and Mitsubishi Electric Corp (TYO:6503) rose 3.7% and 1%, respectively, as a recent report said the two planned to invest a combined 5 trillion yen ($31 billion) in chip development over the next five years.\n\nTokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035) added 1.2%, while Renesas Electronics Corp (TYO:6723) surged 2.9%. But chip testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857) fell slightly after hitting a four-month high earlier in the day.\n\nIn China, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), the country\u2019s biggest chipmaker, rose nearly 2% in Hong Kong trade. Other major Chinese technology stocks also rose, with Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK:9988) and Baidu Inc (HK:9888) rising between 0.5% and 2.3% in Hong Kong trade.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian tech, chipmaking stocks rise as TSMC spurs AI cheer\n\nDonald Trump to address Bitcoin 2024 conference on July 27\n\nAsian stocks surge as TSMC boosts tech; Nikkei at record high\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Undervalued semiconductor stocks are excellent additions to any portfolio because chip sales are expected to rise 13.1% in 2024 after falling about 8% in 2023. Global semiconductor sales climbed 15.8% to $46.4 billion in April, rising monthly for the first time this year. This serves as an encouraging indication for cheap semiconductor stocks.\n\nAmong the primary forces driving the market are the great need for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, increasing smartphone sales and slowing down IC design inventory loss. Thanks to the secular expansion in driverless automobiles, the automotive chip industry will also see great expansion.\n\nIn addition, businesses are focused on moving AI software from data centers to PCs and using innovative packaging methods. And with AI phones, PCs and wearable gadgets, semiconductor demand is set for long-term increase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnder current conditions, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to start buying cheap semiconductor stocks, so Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) won\u2019t come up in our conversation, as it\u2019s up over 172% this year. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on three strong buy, underpriced semiconductor companies with double-digit upside.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares are up 59% this year. But the target price of $168.88 suggests a further 29% upside.\n\nBesides its upside potential, Micron Technology has been profitable for eight of the last 10 years, outperforming more than 58% of the 920 semiconductor businesses. Micron Technology\u2019s Q3 fiscal year 2024 sales grew to $6.81 billion from $5.82 billion and $3.75 billion. Non-GAAP quarterly net income was $702 million, or 62 cents per diluted share, exceeding expectations by 16%.\n\nSolid execution and AI demand boosted Micron Technology\u2019s sequential sales 17%. The company claimed record data center SSD sales and HBM market share. Quarterly operational cash flow rose to $2.48 billion from $1.22 billion. MU forecasts first-quarter FY 2025 revenues of $6.60\u2013$6.80 billion and diluted EPS of 48 cents to 56 cents, powered by AI.\n\nMU\u2019s new products include desktop computer memory based on GDDR7. Suitable for AI and games with many dynamic features, it can manage over 1.5 TB/s and is 60% faster than GDDR6. Also, MU wants to have 32 Gbit DDR5 and GDDR7 memory on hand by 2024, benefiting the gaming and data center sectors especially.\n\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Microchip (MCHP) logo at HQ in Silicon Valley. Microchip Technology Inc. manufactures microcontrollers, mixed-signal, analog and Flash-IP integrated circuits\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) stock is down around 2% in the last month. But considering its microcontroller and analog solutions, MCHP can mount a comeback since upside is over 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe unfavorable mood stems from MCHP\u2019s dismal Q4 of FY 2024 net sales of $1.33 billion, representing a 24.9% drop from the previous quarter and 40.6% from last year. In the same quarter last year, MCHP made $604 million, or $1.09 per share. Yet this year, it made $154.7 million, or 28 cents per split share.\n\nDespite issues, Microchip Technology expects the September 2024 quarter to signal a comeback, with sales to rise sequentially as demand levels out. MCHP estimates Q1 of FY 2025 net sales of $1.22 billion to $1.26 billion and profit per share of 48 cents to 56 cents.\n\nMicrochip has outperformed 99% of its semiconductor rivals in profitability for 10 years, so the quarterly sales dip is likely a transitory hiccup. MCHP\u2019s robust capital returns strategy will further impress investors seeking undervalued semiconductor stocks. It paid out $1.89 billion in dividends and share buybacks in FY 2024, up 15.4%. Its 1.9% yield beats the tech sector\u2019s 1.025%.\n\nOn the product side, Microchip also recently launched 12 new wireless products to simplify Bluetooth for makers of all levels. Modules, system-on-chip products and plug-and-play options improve MCHP\u2019s wireless solutions.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) wraps up our exploration of undervalued semiconductor stocks. It is basking in the glow of Nvidia and other AI stocks, up 26.9% in 2024.\n\nSome investors may believe MRVL is too hot right now. But experts are expecting a 23% upside for this gem among undervalued semiconductor stocks.\n\nThere is sound reason for the enthusiasm. The company had a strong fourth quarter for the FY 2024, with sales increasing 1% to $1.427 billion over the prior year and the company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share growing 12% to 46 cents. The data center division achieved a record year with revenues of $765 million, up 54% year-over-year (YOY) and 38% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ).

        "title": "7 Stocks to Dump Before the AI Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is up more than 50% from 2022 lows. The primary reason for the resilience of the stock market is enthusiasm around AI stocks. Excitement\u00a0surrounding artificial intelligence and its potential as a revolutionary technology have sent AI shares skyward, creating what many believe is a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. That has many wondering whether it\u2019s time to sell.\n\nValuations and investor exuberance are still not as high as they were during the dotcom crash. Yet, investors continue to wonder whether the similarities are too great to ignore. The inflation of each respective bubble was prompted by the introduction of world changing technology. Investors, eager to secure early gains, have rushed to get their piece of the pie. It\u2019s a recipe for trouble if expectations do not meet reality.\n\nThe good news is that important metrics including the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios are currently much lower than they were at the dotcom peak. The bad news is that all bubbles are different and unforeseen factors may be at play now that no one can predict until it\u2019s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is the most obvious choice among AI stocks to sell before any potential bubble bursts. One of the most obvious reasons to believe that is in the similarity between Nvidia and dotcom champion Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nCisco shares surged by roughly 4,500% in the 5-year period prior to its peak in 2000. Nvidia\u2019s Shares are up roughly 4,300% over the past 5 years. Whether it\u2019s a coincidence or not, time will tell.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors continue to bet so bullishly on Nvidia following its most recent earnings report from late May. Revenue surged by more than 250% on a year-over-year basis. Sales reached $26 billion, $22.6 billion of which came from data center sales. It all continues to suggest that Nvidia is one of the best investments in AI which is largely seen as a commodity akin to gold for the digital age.\n\nYet, questions remain about Nvidia and how truly the company is capturing the current opportunity. The truth is that over the past five years Nvidia\u2019s asset growth has outpaced its revenue growth substantially. That\u2019s a real sign that Nvidia\u2019s big bet on AI has not yet produced as substantial results as some may believe. If you need a reason to sell, take that as your signal.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cursory glance at the stock chart of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shows that there are real concerns about a current AI bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare prices surged above $1,800 by mid June and promptly retreated back below $1,600 one week later. That jump and subsequent decline was seen across most of the AI sector and was a representation of broadly held questions by AI investors. Share prices have rebounded since but the volatility is a clear indication that investors recognize Broadcom may be in the midst of an AI fueled bubble.\n\nBroadcom isn\u2019t a pure play AI stock but the company did mention \u2018AI\u2019 51 times in its most recent earnings call. So AVGO may well be the beneficiary of a halo effect surrounding all things AI.\n\nThere are indications that Broadcom internally feels that its share price can\u2019t grow much further. The company has chosen to implement a 10-for-one forward stock split. Such a stock split does nothing to change the fundamentals of the underlying company and primarily serves to increase prices due to psychological effects. Management\u2019s decision to implement the forward split should serve as a clue to investors to sell.\n\nFundamentals based screening tools suggest Broadcom is significantly overvalued at present. It\u2019s clearly benefiting from the AI halo effect and is at risk as such.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has come back to life following the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC24). AI is partially responsible for the resurgence in share prices at Apple indicating it is highly exposed to AI bubble hype.\n\nApple introduced two things at the briefly held conference on June 10. Those big upgrades include iOS 18 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. The company\u2019s massive user base is now poised to receive years of upgrades. That promises to send share prices higher. However, a question arises: how much of that recent surge in share prices is simply AI hype?\n\nIt is of course a question that no one can answer currently. Nevertheless, investors remain somewhat cautious. Apple\u2019s revenues are still not as strong as they were a year ago. So, while the introduction of iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence is promising, the company is still facing an uphill battle.\n\nApple continues to produce substantial cash flows that allow it to satisfy shareholders but if its generative AI efforts prove fruitless it won\u2019t be able to substantiate share prices at this level moving forward.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) might not look the way investors expect it to.\n\nIf AMD\u2019s AI bubble bursts it will really be about investor perception of the company\u2019s inability to capture a greater percentage of sales from Nvidia. The point here is that some analysts see indications of that sort of weak competitiveness indicated at price levels between $116 and $132.\n\nThose price levels may be much higher than many would expect following a bubble burst. Yet, that\u2019s exactly where technical analysts see AMD falling to if it continues to be ineffective in clawing away market share from Nvidia.\n\nAMD Shares are up roughly 14% year-to-date. Those same shares rose from $140 at New Year\u2019s to more than $210 by early March. They now trade for $160. AMD is expected to grow revenues by 14% in 2024. If investors are judging the stock\u2019s performance relative to sales, there might be very little reason to invest in AMD currently.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is ever a stock to sell. It has provided 10X returns over the past decade and Windows and Office continue to provide a fortress of strength in which the company dwells.\n\nDespite those obvious strengths there are concerns that Microsoft is overpriced at the moment primarily due to AI. Any investor has simply to look at the company\u2019s current P/E ratio of 39x, well above its 10-year median.\n\nHow much of that increase in valuation is justified? Is the $30 CoPilot add on worth it? No one really knows because as my colleague Dana Blankenhorn pointed out, Microsoft didn\u2019t break out its performance.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella was happy to boast about its initial uptake earlier this year but not much else has been said since. That\u2019s a troublesome sign. Microsoft is well protected by Windows and Office so any AI bubble burst won\u2019t crush it. However, it may not be a bad time to reap profits now as bubble questions continue to swirl.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has sunken like a stone in 2024. Therefore, it probably won\u2019t be too difficult to persuade readers to avoid it moving forward.\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Intel due to AI earlier in the year. Intel announced the launch of a systems foundry designed for the AI era in February. That was around the tail end of the time during which Intel was seen as a legitimate competitor to Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Intel lags well behind Nvidia when it comes to AI chips. Intel\u2019s leading chip is called Gaudi-3. Those chips are supposed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chips which will be released around the same time. The problem is that Intel\u2019s chips are not nearly as powerful.\n\nThe result is that Intel\u2019s opportunity to benefit from the AI halo may already be over. Furthermore, Intel\u2019s revenues peaked in 2021. They\u2019re not expected to rebound to those levels until 2028.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a stock that is at once one of the best investments and one of those which is most exposed to the AI bubble.\n\nIt is one of the best investments at the moment because it is so exposed to the AI opportunity. Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing serves as the world\u2019s foundry, producing the world\u2019s most advanced chips including those for AI applications. It is because of that excellent positioning that the stock has grown by nearly 80% in 2024.\n\nThe flip side of that tremendous growth is obvious: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also heavily exposed to the inherent dangers of an AI bubble. Given that TSM provides the actual chips sold by Nvidia, AMD and many others, it stands to be punished heavily if and when things go wrong.\n\nTSM\u2019s P/E ratio is currently the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s more than double its median over the last decade. That\u2019s a bit worrisome given the fact that the company has been the foundry to the world during that period. The hype around AI is the clear reason it\u2019s become so valuable in 2024. As questions continue to swirl about the true value of AI, TSM will continue to be on bubble watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Let\u2019s look at some of the most undervalued stocks investors can buy right now for under $20 per share.\n\nRecently, despite the overall market rising substantially over the past several years, these names have fallen particularly hard. These firms all have several things in common, including having positive net income, market capitalizations above $1 billion and forward price-to-earnings ratios that are near or below average for their sectors.\n\nThey also look very favorable when considering their current price compared to the average analyst price target. Based on that metric, all these stocks have implied upside of between 50% and 100%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI\u2019ll provide a brief overview of the operations of each company. I\u2019ll also go over important financial metrics and provide some information on what analysts expect going forward.\n\nBumble (BMBL) The logo for Bumble (BMBL) is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) operates five apps intended to help people build meaningful connections. This includes the well-known app Bumble, which is a dating app focused on providing a better user experience for women.\n\nThe company\u2019s first online dating platform was Badoo, which launched in 2006. It\u2019s a market leader in Europe and Latin America, with 1.2 million users.\n\nShares have fallen 36% so far in 2024, and now Bumble looks like one of the more undervalued stocks in the communication services sector that is also profitable.\n\nMuch of this drop has been due to fewer young people using dating apps. A 2023 survey of 1,000 college students found only 21% of them used dating apps. However, this hasn\u2019t materialized with Bumble, which increased its number of paying users by 18% over the past year and its revenues by 10%.\n\nAnalysts are expecting similar revenue growth going forward, and the average price target implies an upside of 58% from the current share price of $9.34.\n\nSavers Value Village (SVV) Large supermarket in a shopping center abandoned and boarded up\n\nSource: Carolyn Franks / Shutterstock.com\n\nSavers Value Village (NYSE:SVV) is the largest operator of for-profit thrift stores in the United States and Canada, based on the number of stores.\n\nThe company sells various retail products, from clothing to used electronics and other miscellaneous items. The company gets merchandise donated to it directly from the public through drop-off locations at its stores or purchases it from its non-profit partners.\n\nThe firm has grown its revenues well above U.S. clothing stores overall, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nLowering inflation should help drive down costs for the firm, and potential interest rate cuts later in the year could boost demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares are down 33% year-to-date and 50% over the past 12 months. The average price target from analysts who have updated their forecasts since the last earnings release is $21. This implies an upside of 65% from the current price of $12.75.\n\nGetty Images (GETY) Image of Getty Image logo on gray background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/360b\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is a provider of visual content to large enterprises, small businesses and individual content creators. The firm uses its platforms Getty Images, iStock and Unsplash to deliver visual content through a la carte and subscription business models.\n\nShares are down 32% over the past 12 months. Fallout from the WGA Writers Strike affected the firm in 2023, reducing revenue they could generate by selling pictures of Hollywood stars who were unable to shoot TV and films.\n\nThis year, the stock is down due to a massive earnings miss caused by a much higher-than-expected tax bill. Analysts predict the firm\u2019s taxes will revert to normal levels.\n\nThe company increased its active users by 79% last quarter and is continuing to grow its partnership with NVIDIA(NASDAQ: NVDA) to provide commercially safe gen-AI images. Analysts expect earnings-per-share to increase by 74% over the next year, with an average price target of $6.03 suggesting a 93% upside from the current $3.13 price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Leo Miller did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Gems Poised for 100% Gains in 18 Months",
        "content": "Finding undervalued growth stocks in the middle of a bull market is no easy task. By definition, they are investments rising in value over time. With the S&P 500 trading up about 25% so far this year, locating these discounted hidden gems remains a challenge but doable.\n\nJust because a growth stock has gained in value doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t keep rising. Letting your winners run is a valid investment strategy because, like Newton\u2019s Law of Motion, an object in motion tends to remain in motion. Unless a calamity strikes these growth stocks, there is a good chance they will keep right on rising.\n\nTheir growth also doesn\u2019t mean they are anywhere near full valuation. A growth stock\u2019s expansion may be outpacing the multiple the market is assigning. That\u2019s the type of undervalued growth stock we\u2019re looking for: its fundamentals are in place and widening just as it is beginning to realize its full potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three undervalued growth stocks that fit the bill. Let\u2019s dive in to see why they should be able to double in value by the end of 2025.\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (TKC) Multiple hands holding up their cell phones\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first question you might have about Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (NYSE:TKC) is: who? The company is the leading mobile phone operator in Turkey but also provides broadband services to consumers and businesses, digital payment systems, cloud services and data center operations.\n\nTurkey is an important emerging market that saw its economy expand 4.5% in 2023 despite a major earthquake early in the year that killed over 53,000 people and injured more than 107,000 people. Between 2002 and 2022, Turkey\u2019s GDP increased by an average of 5.4% a year. Although economic growth is expected to slow this year to 3%, the World Bank expects \u201crobust\u201d growth in the years ahead.\n\nTurkcell has been in business for 30 years, originally as a telecom operator but evolving into a significant technology provider. Its stock is up 71% in 2024 and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Shares go for just eight times next year\u2019s earnings estimates and Wall Street forecasts profits will rapidly expand at a 31% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). TKC stock trades at a tiny fraction of that growth while going for less than twice its sales and a bargain-basement 5x free cash flow (FCF).\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri might not be a household name but is a dramatically undervalued growth stock. It should readily double from its current $8 per share level, making it one of the best undervalued growth stocks to pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenesis Energy (GEL) Pipelines in the desert\n\nSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Genesis Energy\u2019s (NYSE:GEL) name might make you think it is a utility, in reality it is a midstream operator in the oil and gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, Genesis operates primarily around the Gulf coast region. It has one of the largest offshore pipeline networks in the Deepwater area; is one of the biggest sodium and soda ash producers; and is one of the largest crude and petroleum transportation providers serving\u00a0 two of the largest refinery complexes in the U.S.\n\nBecause it operates under long-term take-or-pay contracts, it means Genesis gets paid regardless of whether its customers accept delivery of its products or services or not. Those superlatives are not going without notice.\n\nThe midstream operator\u2019s stock is up 24% in 2024 and\u00a048% over the past year. Yet shares trade at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales and projected earnings growth. Those profits are forecast to expand by 44% annually for the next five years.\n\nThe one complicating factor for Genesis investors is it is organized as a master limited partnership (MLP). That introduces potentially complex tax issues depending upon whether you invest through a taxable brokerage account or in an IRA. But if the stock meets your individual needs, GEL is an undervalued growth stock ready to double.\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) two businesspeople sit at a table stacking up coins in the shape of an ascending bar chart. overlooked growth stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArguably the most surprising undervalued growth stock to buy is iShares S&P Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks large U.S. companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. Basically, it is an ETF growth stock tracking growth stocks.\n\nWhat makes IVW a stock to buy is the likelihood the broad market itself will continue to appreciate in value. Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell just said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach regarding inflation. What it sees so far is positive.

Eir Nols\u00f8e reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe number of UK millionaires is expected to shrink by 17pc between 2023 and 2028, according to Swiss investment bank UBS, which published its research just days after Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s landslide victory.\n\nIts annual Global Wealth Report revealed that around 519,000 millionaires are expected to quit the UK over the period, which is the most pronounced drop of all the countries it tracks.\n\nThis will take the country\u2019s total tally to 2.5 million.\n\nThe Netherlands is the only other country expected to post a decline, although its drop is much smaller at 4pc.\n\nBy contrast, countries like Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand are among those with the sharpest rises.\n\nThe projection comes as Britain\u2019s high earners fear a series of new wealth taxes under Labour, alongside a renewed crackdown on non-doms.\n\nHowever, Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global, said the reasons for the drop went beyond just higher taxes.\n\nRead the full story...\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Szu Ping Chan reports:\n\nCatherine Mann\u00a0said the rising cost of services such as airfares and restaurant bills and ongoing \u201clabour market tightness\u201d meant wages were still rising at a pace that was not consistent with the Bank\u2019s 2pc inflation target.\n\nMs Mann also described the drop in inflation back to 2pc in May as \u201ctouch and go\u201d as she warned price rises were likely to climb again in the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cUntil I see some sustained deceleration in services prices, I\u2019m really not in a position [to cut rates],\u201d she said.\n\nEchoing comments made by Bank\u2019s chief economist Huw Pill, Ms Mann highlighted that services prices were still rising by almost 6pc on an annual basis. \u201cWe have to see some discipline in service sector price growth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe 2pc that we have seen is touch and go, meaning we\u2019re going to be above 2pc for the rest of the year, and that matters for my decision making.\u201d\n\n05:50 PM BST\n\nEuropean shares rise amid real estate boost\n\nEuropean shares advanced on Wednesday amid broad-based gains and upbeat corporate updates, while investors digested more comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s second day of testimony.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.9pc, buoyed by a 2.1pc rise in real estate shares.\n\nFrench stocks were also up nearly 0.9pc after falling yesterday, as markets assessed the turbulent political situation following Sunday\u2019s legislative election.\n\nSupporting share prices, the yield on government bonds across the euro zone fell in a sign of investors unwinding the political risk premium they had attached to the countries before the France\u2019s parliamentary runoff vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerome Powell said on his second day of congressional testimony he was not ready to conclude that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2pc though he had \u201csome confidence of that\u201d.\n\nMarkets are now awaiting June inflation data out of the US and Germany due on Thursday to gauge the timing of potential interest rate cuts.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\nEx-BBC boss wields the axe at CNN\n\nThe former head of the BBC is wielding the axe at CNN as the Left-leaning news channel grapples with a decline in traditional TV viewing. James Warrington reports:\n\nSir Mark Thompson, chief executive of CNN, has outlined plans to cut roughly 100 jobs as the company merges newsrooms across its digital and pay-TV operations.\n\nIn a memo to employees, the news chief said the cuts represented less than 3pc of CNN\u2019s workforce of around 3,500 people.\n\nSir Mark, who served as director general of the BBC until 2012, was appointed to CNN last year to lead turnaround efforts at the struggling cable network as it tries to navigate the shift to streaming.\n\nAlongside the job cuts, the broadcasting boss said CNN will launch a new digital subscription business before the end of the year.\n\nHe said this service will generate more than a billion dollars in revenue and help to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the network.\n\nCNN has struggled to embrace the shift to the streaming era, while the liberal channel also suffered a collapse in viewing figures following the election of US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe network launched the CNN+ streaming service in 2022, but this was quickly shut down following the merger that formed its new parent company Warner Bros Discovery.

The Fed responded by raising its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has plummeted from its 9.1pc peak to 3.3pc.\n\nPowell told the House panel on Wednesday that, to avoid damaging the economy, the Fed likely wouldn\u2019t wait until inflation reached its 2pc target before it would start cutting rates.

Lucy Burton reports:\n\nThe 4 Day Week Campaign, which is urging bosses to sign up to its second nationwide trial later this year, said that \u201cwith a new Labour Government, change is in the air\u201d.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, sought to distance himself from the idea on Wednesday, with a spokesman confirming that \u201cthis isn\u2019t [the] Government\u2019s planned policy\u201d.\n\nThis is thought to be the first time that Labour has publicly set out its stance on the topic, after facing pressure from unions and activists to adopt a four-day working week as an official policy in the run-up to the election.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nPayment problems stifle Russian imports of Chinese cars\n\nPayment issues between Russia and China, caused by US sanctions, pose serious issues for Russian imports of Chinese cars that have supplied the domestic market over the last two years, the head of Russia\u2019s car dealers\u2019 association has said.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have resorted to complex steps to try to avoid payment delays, including a workaround using small, regional Chinese banks, as the threat of secondary US sanctions on Chinese banks that facilitate trade with Russia deters larger lenders.\n\nAlexei Podshchekoldin, president of the Association of Russian Automobile Dealers, said the problem was particularly serious for smaller importers, who had seen payments bounce.\n\nThe upshot is fewer exports for China, while Russian importers lose business and possibly face added costs.\n\nChinese carmakers have already seized more than half of Russia\u2019s car market since Western competitors pulled out, taking their technology and know-how with them, after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nChina\u2019s car exports to Russia were up 36pc year-on-year in money terms to $4.86bn (\u00a33.78bn) in January-May, according to Chinese customs statistics.\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nLabour plans for living wage could hinder interest rate cuts, warns broker\n\nThe Government\u2019s plans to hike the living wage \u201ccould weigh on BOE [Bank of England\u2019s] rate cut hopes\u201d, a leading broker has claimed.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:\n\nThe Tory government raised the living wage by nearly 10pc in April, which was the largest increase since the Blair era. Labour have said that they could increase it even more.\n\nBack in June, the BOE cautioned that the increase in the living wage could feed through to wage growth more broadly and lead to upward pressure on price growth, particularly core prices.\n\nThus, now that Labour have won the election and have said that they will focus on workers\u2019 rights, the BOE may be more reluctant to cut rates until they know exactly how much upward pressure on wages could be coming down the pipeline.\n\nWe may not know the government\u2019s plans for raising the living wage until we get the budget in the Autumn, thus a rate cut could be pushed further out to the latter part of [the year], especially if the new government\u2019s policies lead to the BOE and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] raising their UK growth forecasts.\n\n04:20 PM BST\n\nBP, Shell and Total take stake in UAE energy project\n\nBritish energy giants BP and Shell, along with France\u2019s TotalEnergies, will each take a 10pc stake in a liquefied natural gas project in the United Arab Emirates, state energy giant Adnoc has said.\n\nJapanese trading company Mitsui will also acquire 10 percent of the Ruwais LNG plant, scheduled to come online in 2028, Adnoc said.\n\nAdnoc, the UAE\u2019s key revenue-earner, will retain a 60 percent majority stake.\n\nThe \u00a0plant, currently under development in Abu Dhabi, is expected to produce about 9.6m metric tonnes a year, more than doubling the company\u2019s LNG production capacity in the UAE.\n\nGas is being touted as cleaner than other fossil fuels as countries around the world strive to reduce their emissions and slow global warming.\n\nDemand for gas spiked following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with several Gulf countries looking to boost output.\n\nQatar this year announced new plans to expand output from the world\u2019s biggest natural gas field, saying it will boost capacity to 142 million tonnes per year before 2030.\n\n04:12 PM BST\n\nRevolut backer raises \u00a31.8bn to invest in UK tech businesses\n\nEarly Revolut-backer Index Ventures has raised a fresh $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) to invest in fast-growing businesses as the firm hailed the prospects of the UK tech sector. Matt Field reports:\n\nThe venture capital fund, which recently expanded its London presence with a new office in Soho, said on Wednesday it had closed an $800m venture fund as well as a $1.5bn fund aimed at more established businesses.\n\nThe new funding comes as venture investors pile into artificial intelligence companies amid a groundswell of interest in the technology. Index has backed companies including Mistral, the French OpenAI rival, which was recently valued at $6bn.\n\nHannah Seal, a partner at Index, told The Telegraph: \u201cThe UK has always been a really important ecosystem for Index. We have invested \u00a31bn into 144 UK start-ups.\n\n\u201cWe expect that will continue. But also we are seeing incredible AI talent coming out of the UK.\u201d\n\nLord Livermore, the Labour growth minister, said: \u201cBoosting private investment into the UK economy is an urgent priority for our growth mission, so I very warmly welcome\u00a0Index\u00a0Ventures\u2019 commitment to Britain and their vote of confidence in our VC sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how private investment in the technologies of the future will create thousands of jobs so people across the UK can benefit.\u201d\n\nMs Seal added: \u201cOur incentives and our goals are aligned with the government - boost the productivity of the UK and make it a powerhouse for start-ups.\u201d\n\n04:05 PM BST\n\nOil hits two-week low amid worries about weak Chinese demand\n\nOil prices hit a two-week low today, before adding around 0.4pc today after a American Petroleum Institute report came out showing shrinking US investories.\n\nTraders have been concerned about weak Chinese demand, and uncertainly over US interest rates has also been cited as contributing to the drop.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at online trading platform IG.\n\nFaced with underwhelming Chinese data, and expected supply increases thanks to Hurricane Beryl\u2019s swerving of key production facilities, oil prices briefly hit a two-week low today.\n\nThe summer demand hopes that took prices to a one-month high have been swiftly replaced by worries about weak Chinese demand. Investors continue to watch the Middle East however, anxious about the lingering possibility of Israel widening its conflict to take on Hezbollah.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nUS inflation rate will show \u2018slow decrease\u2019\n\nThe US releases new inflation data this week, which will give traders a clearer steer on the likely speed of interest rate cuts. The Consumer Price Index is due out on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report is expected on Friday.\n\nBets on a quarter point rate cut by September ticked up to 74pc, up from around 70pc on Tuesday and 45pc a month ago, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch. It comes after Fed chairmanJerome Powell gave tesimony in the US Congress yesterday in which he said that there had been \u2018considerable progress\u2019 on inflation.\n\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said:\n\nPowell came in a little bit more dovish than we expected ... he\u2019s purposely trying to signal to markets that if there is a good inflation print this week, September is back on the table as a possibility for a rate cut.\n\nJulien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said:\n\nWe expect to see a continued albeit slow decrease in the rate of inflation. In particular, price pressures should have stayed relatively elevated within services ... The direction of travel remains unchanged and we continue to expect lower inflation ahead. As such and with increasing signs that the US economy is slowing down, we believe that the Fed could be in a position to lower interest rates in September.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nChip giant AMD to buy AI startup in race against Nvidia\n\nAmerican chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said today it will acquire Finnish artificial intelligence startup Silo AI for about $665m (\u00a3518m) in cash as the company tries to enhance its AI chip capabilities to compete against industry leader Nvidia.\n\nAcquiring Silo AI will help AMD improve the development and deployment of AMD-powered AI models and help potential customers build complex AI models with the company\u2019s chips, AMD said.\n\nSilo AI will also strengthen AMD\u2019s software development capabilities.\n\nWhile the deal will not impact AMD\u2019s financial performance, it \u201cunlocks a significant amount of business moving forward,\u201d AMD\u2019s Vamsi Boppana said.\n\nAMD declined to discuss how much business the acquisition would generate over time.\n\nThe acquisition marks the latest step from AMD in a series of moves aimed at expanding its footprint in the AI landscape.

        "content": "Vodafone Group Public Limited Company VOD recently announced that it has joined forces with Meta Platforms META to optimize the delivery of short-form videos and ensure efficient utilization of existing network infrastructure. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube are witnessing a rapid increase in video consumption, leading to significant growth in data usage on mobile networks. Per Ericsson's 2024 Mobility Report, global data traffic rose 25% in the 12 months leading up to the first quarter of 2024, with video making up 73% of all mobile traffic by the end of 2023.\r\n\r\nThis relentless growth in data usage puts considerable strain on network infrastructure. Telecom operators have to bear hefty costs to upgrade networks and accommodate the surging data traffic. Telecom companies argue that as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the network upgrade, the big tech companies should contribute to the expenses. Aligned with this concept, prominent telecom operators, including Orange, Telecom Italia and Telefonica earlier proposed that Google, Netflix, Meta and Amazon should shoulder a portion of 5G rollout costs.\r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, Meta has made improvements to its video engineering and infrastructure deployment systems for more efficient video delivery. Vodafone has successfully freed up network capacity at key 4G and 5G sites in high-traffic areas like shopping centers and transport hubs. Implementing these optimizations across Vodafone's has boosted network efficiency in its European without compromising the viewing experience.\r\n\r\n5G subscription currently stands at 15% of total subscriptions in Europe, and the figure is projected to climb to 53% by 2028. This significant 5G growth presents both opportunities and challenges for telecom operators. Vodafone\u2019s partnership with Meta is likely to pave the way for other operators to adopt proactive measures in managing network congestion and enhancing service quality.\r\n\r\nThe stock has lost 0.3% over the past year compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 9.9%.

        "content": "The Q2 earnings season is just around the corner, with the big banks kicking the period into a much higher gear starting this Friday with their results. The overall earnings picture has remained stable leading up to the period, with Tech expected to deliver another big showing.\n\nOf course, there are some worthy reports that investors should keep on their radars, a list that includes beloved Nvidia NVDA, McDonald\u2019s MCD, and Discover Financial Services DFS.\n\nWith Nvidia, we\u2019ll get some more color on the AI trade, whereas MCD and DFS can provide us with deeper views into the current state of consumers.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at how each presently stacks up heading into their respective releases.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Results to Confirm AI Bullishness\n\nNvidia\u2019s robust performance over the last year has been driven by unrelenting demand for chips used in AI applications.

The company has consistently blown away our consensus estimates regarding the metric, with the most recent beat totaling a sizable $1.8 billion.\n\nAs shown below, all four of the most recent beats have been more than $1.4 billion, reflecting the company\u2019s red-hot demand. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning headline figures, consensus estimates for both the top and bottom line have moved higher over the last several months. Enormous growth is expected, with the current estimates suggesting a 130% pop in earnings on a 110% sales increase.\n\nNvidia\u2019s sales growth has been remarkable, posting triple-digit percentage year-over-year increases in each of its last four quarters. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDiscover Financial Services Enjoys Loan Growth\n\nDFS shares have loosely tracked the broader market in 2024, gaining roughly 18% compared to an 18.5% gain from the S&P 500. Shares enjoyed post-earnings positivity following its latest release despite falling short of EPS expectations, with favorable segment results enough to please investors. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have taken a bullish stance for the quarter to be reported, with the $2.99 per share consensus estimate up 8% since April. Revenue expectations have moved similarly, moving 2% higher to $4.2 billion over the same timeframe. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s net charge-off rate moved higher to 4.9% throughout its latest quarter, the CEO noted that delinquencies were stabilizing. Loan growth was notably positive throughout the same period, moving 12% higher to $126.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald's Faces Consumer Pressure\n\nMCD shares have displayed considerable weakness year-to-date, losing roughly 16% in value and widely underperforming. Shares haven\u2019t been able to sustain positivity following quarterly results, with consumers seemingly growing tired of elevated prices. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings expectations moved lower following its latest release but have since remained stable, with the $3.10 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 2% pullback relative to the same period last year. Revenue expectations have similarly moved lower, with the $6.7 billion expected down from the $6.8 billion estimate in late April. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCEO Chris Kempcinski noted the recent consumer stubbornness but remained positive, stating, \u201cAs consumers are more discriminating with every dollar that they spend, we will continue to earn their visits by delivering leading, reliable, everyday value and outstanding execution in our restaurants. As we look to the rest of 2024 and beyond, we remain focused on leveraging the competitive advantages within our Accelerating the Arches plan and growing QSR market share to drive long-term growth.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, elevated prices have aided the company\u2019s margins in a big way, as we can see illustrated below. Please note that the chart is on a trailing twelve-month basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Q2 earnings season has already officially started, but this Friday\u2019s big bank results will really kick the period into high gear.\n\nThe earnings picture has largely remained stable, with tech expected to flex strong growth yet again.\n\nAnd a few notable releases that investors should keep an eye on include Nvidia NVDA, McDonald\u2019s MCD, and Discover Financial Services DFS.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer",
        "content": "Over the last five years, Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) has experienced exponential growth, fueled by the skyrocketing demand for advanced artificial intelligence rack-scale direct liquid cooling systems, enhancing the performance and efficiency of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) technologies.\n\nAs a core technology player in the AI revolution, Super Micro Computer is building its leadership position across this burgeoning market.\n\nSuper Micro Computer surges with 600% earnings boost, projects $5.5 billion in revenue amid AI boom\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SMCI.\n\nIn the past five years, earnings have grown by more than 600% and reached a record high of $600 million in its fiscal third quarter of 2023. Therefore, it will be well positioned to deliver strong growth in earnings and revenue for the better part of the year, riding on record settings in demand for AI rack scale direct liquid cooling systems. The high demand for products from Nvidia, Intel and AMD were the key drivers of the company's projected fourth-quarter revenue increase by 133% to 152% to between $5.10 billion and $5.50 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is strategically positioned at the forefront of a technological revolution, carving out a significant niche within the burgeoning AI market. As demand for AI capabilities skyrockets across various industries, the company's advanced liquid cooling solutions and its strategic positioning in the server and data center sector should allow it to capitalize on a market poised to grow to $430 billion by 2033.\n\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2023, Super Micro Computer reported a staggering 200% increase in revenue, totaling $3.85 billion, up from less than $2 billion in 2021. This explosive growth underscores the company's robust response to increasing demand for data processing capabilities. The company, primarily generating revenue through its servers and storage systems designed for data centers, has successfully tapped into the critical needs of modern computingspeed, efficiency and high-capacity processing. These systems support AI applications, cloud computing and edge computing, which are crucial for handling extensive data operations. A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer\n\nSource: Super Micro Computer presentation\n\nLeading the way with cutting-edge AI and liquid cooling innovations\n\nSuper Micro Computer has utilized advanced technologies from industry leaders like Nvidia, Intel and AMD. It has also used these in its server products, thus making its technological innovation very exciting. Such integration has improved its server products and positioned them accordingly with global technological changes like Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch collaborations have strengthened the market position of Super Micro Computer and given traction to its revenue streams with product offerings like AI rack-scale DLC systems. These are some of the most critical elements that make for data center thermal load management and have witnessed record demand in the face of efficiency and increasing processing demands of AI tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the financial results point to the stability and growth potential of the company to the fullest extent. Net income for Super Micro Computer in the third quarter surged 367% year over year to $402 million, with earnings per share jumping from $1.63 to $6.65. This could not have resulted from revenue growth, but more from strategic business operations and cost management.\n\nFinally, like any other technology company, Super Micro Computer could be threatened by economic cycles and heavy competition. However, specialization in hot niches like AI cooling solutions and customized server products protects the former from these disturbances. Thus, continuous innovation and flexibility to adjust according to market demand opens new opportunities for further expansion.\n\nSuper Micro unveils game-changing liquid-cooled AI data center solutions with Nvidia partnership\n\nThe total IT solution provider for AI, cloud storage and 5G technology has also reiterated its commitment to creating a ready-to-deploy liquid-cooled AI data center for cloud-native solutions. The new DLC solution is designed to accelerate generative AI adoption for enterprises across various industries as it is optimized for the Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform.\n\nThe unveiling of the new data center cooling system is part of the company's push to provide solutions that can reduce energy requirements. Super Micro Computer is closely working with Nvidia to enhance the development of data centers that ensure seamless and flexible transition of AI applications from production to deployment.\n\nThe company also inked a strategic partnership with Data Section and Foxconn (TPE:2354) to develop a rack-scale liquid-cooled solution for new data centers that leverage advanced Nvidia GPUs. The new system will support advanced AI enterprise systems while delivering robust performance and generative AI applications.\n\nFinally, according to financial advisor Steven Kibbel, Super Micro Computer's advanced liquid cooling technology enables closer GPU placement for high-demand AI tasks, enhancing data center efficiency by up to 40% and reducing environmental impact. With pre-built racks for rapid AI system deployment, the company supports global AI demand through projects like Japan's AI center, advancing AI technology and maintaining a competitive edge in image generation and high-speed computing. This progress is underscored by impressive growth figures and strategic partnerships that drive demand in the global server market. A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer\n\nImage source: Reuters\n\nHigh-growth potential with discounted stock - A golden opportunity\n\nEven as Super Micro Computer grows revenue and earnings at a double-digit pace, its stock trades at a discount with a price-earnings multiple of 23. In contrast, Nvidia, one of the industry's big players and a poster child of the AI trend in the semiconductor space, is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 46.\n\nWhile lower than the average earnings multiple of 30 for the Nasdaq 100, the price-earnings ratio is reasonable for a profitable company growing at an impressive rate. Additionally, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth given the artificial intelligence story is just starting, with the market expected to balloon to over $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nManagement believes Super Micro Computer has what it takes to reach $25 billion in recurring revenue across all its product lines over the next five years. The race to $25 billion in annual revenue is part of the company's strategy that focuses on enhancing the development of IT rack solutions powered by some of the most sought-after GPUS and CPUs from Nvidia and Intel. The company is also accelerating the development of liquid cooling infrastructure solutions, which should support the growing demand for data centers to host AI applications.\n\nWhile the current 12-month trailing revenue is $11.8 billion, management expects the company to grow at a compound annual rate of 16%, which is achievable. Considering the current gross profit margin of 15%, the company would quickly generate earnings of up to $1.70 billion. Earnings of more than $1.50 billion would significantly dwarf the current price-earnings multiple of 23 that investors must pay for the stock, considering the company generated $673 million in net income in fiscal 2023. A Look at AI Powerhouse Super Micro Computer\n\nSource: Super Micro Computer presentation\n\nBottom line\n\nEven though Super Micro Computer's stock has exploded by over 190% year to date, there is still room for more gains, given the strong demand for the company's AI server solution products. Increasing demand for power and cooling as data centers struggle with mounting AI tasks should present significant growth opportunities for the company.\n\nTherefore, the stock is currently trading at a discount compared to its peers. Further, factoring in the robust revenue and earnings growth rates as the artificial intelligence opportunity in the server market explodes, the stock remains a solid buy despite additional market pullbacks.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has agreed to buy Silo AI for $665 million in cash, adding a maker of artificial intelligence models that will help its push to close the gap on Nvidia Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers NYC Penthouse Sells for $135 Million in Priciest Deal Since 2022 Microsoft, Apple Drop OpenAI Board Plans as Scrutiny Grows\n\nThe US chipmaker is acquiring the Helsinki-based company, which describes itself as Europe\u2019s largest private AI lab and has customers that include Allianz SE, Unilever Plc and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG unit Rolls-Royce, it said in a statement on Wednesday. Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Peter Sarlin will continue to lead his team, which will become part of AMD\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Group.\n\nSanta Clara, California-based AMD is seen as Nvidia\u2019s closest potential competitor in the fast-growing market for hardware used to develop new software and services powered by AI. Graphics chips, which the two companies specialize in, have proven the most efficient means to train the large language models that underpin user-facing services like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Copilot.\n\n\u201cSilo AI\u2019s team of trusted AI experts and proven experience developing leadership AI models and solutions, including state-of-the-art LLMs built on AMD platforms, will further accelerate our AI strategy and advance the build-out and rapid implementation of AI solutions for our global customers,\u201d said AMD Senior Vice President Vamsi Boppana.\n\nShares of AMD rose 1.4% at 9:43 a.m. in New York.\n\nAMD\u2019s still a relative newcomer to the AI development field, and it\u2019s racing to add hardware and software to its lineup. The company is eyeing an opportunity that fueled a sales boom at Nvidia and helped turn it into the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker.\n\nUnder CEO Lisa Su, AMD has introduced a line of MI300 accelerators and promised that the products will generate about $4 billion in revenue this year. That\u2019s much more than the projections of other accelerator contenders, such as Intel Corp. But Nvidia itself is expected to generate more than $100 billion this year from its data center chip business alone.\n\nSilo AI specializes in creating AI models and systems that are tailored to the specific needs of individual companies. The acquisition comes on top of $125 million in investments that AMD has made in the last 12 months increasing its suite of offerings that make it easier to use AMD chip-based systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD\u2019s stock has gained about 20% in 2024, trailing the 38% advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index and the 165% gain by Nvidia. Even with that modest relative gain, AMD\u2019s market capital of $286 billion is close to an all-time high for the company.\n\n(Adds share price in the fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era Family Offices of the Ultra-Rich Shed Privacy With Activist Bets\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Thanks to Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) astronomical rise this year, high-potential stocks are on everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s stock outperformed the S&P 500 with a 166.1% gain in the last year, compared to 26.4%. NVIDIA stock is up 149.51% in 2024. The wider indexes concluded the first half positively, thanks to Nvidia and other AI performers.\n\nNvidia is helping maintain momentum. It recently introduced the next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture to improve AI speed and efficiency and executed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt CES 2024, NVIDIA introduced NVIDIA Omnacle for car setups and DRIVE for autonomous driving.\n\nHowever, Nvidia\u2019s 75x price-to-earnings is worse than 78% of 632 chip firms and far higher than its 10-year average of 45x. Other high-potential stocks may match Nvidia\u2019s performance this year. Analysts appreciate these high-potential stocks because of their growth potential, and their upside is more than 30% in each instance.\n\nDisney (DIS)\n\nSource: Walt Disney Co\n\nDisney\u2018s (NYSE:DIS) stock price has been erratic lately; it is currently $97, a 31.5% increase that supports its \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus recommendation.\n\nDisney\u2019s sales in the fiscal second quarter were below analyst projections, driving the current mood; this is the fourth time. A proxy fight headed by independent investor Nelson Peltz further tarnished the market mood.\n\nBut Bob Iger\u2019s management won the proxy fight; investors reposed faith, and Disney+ and Hulu made a profit for the first time in Q2, thus helping to offset the $18 million shortfall of the streaming operation from $659 million a year earlier.\n\nBy autumn 2025, ESPN wants to become a stand-alone, interactive digital destination with live events, studio programming and tailored features. Disney+ also performs well on Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d and \u201cPercy Jackson and the Olympians.\u201d\n\nCEO Bob Iger discussed the streaming company\u2019s profitability for the quarter and said that all units covered by the streaming umbrella should aim to be profitable by Q4.\n\nAdditionally, Disney is working with Nike (NYSE:NKE) on a sportswear collection, which is significant as Disney is canceling its Adidas contract.\n\nDisney and Epic Games, owned by Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), are creating a new Fortnite realm.

Li Auto is now the leading Chinese new energy auto brand, delivering 822,345 cars.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total income for the first quarter of 2024 was about $3.6 billion, 36.4% more than the first quarter of 2023. As of June, Li Auto had 497 shops and 421 repair centers in 148 towns in China. The company also has 614 supercharging stations and 2,726 charging stations, showing that it is even more dedicated to improving the infrastructure for EV users.\n\nIn March, Li Auto released and started sending out its high-tech lineup of top MPVs, the Li MEGA and the 2024 Li L series.\n\nIn April, Li Auto debuted its five-seat luxury family SUV, Li L6 SUV, at $34,500. The debut has been greeted well; the stock price rose upon news release. In the cutthroat EV industry, this model is supposed to increase Li Auto\u2019s market share. The L6 offers longer-range choices and more features to draw in a larger clientele.\n\nWarner Bros (WBD) A close-up of the blue and yellow Warner Bros (WBD) sign.\n\nSource: Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) is down 39% this year as the stock market punished them for heavy debt and poor results.

        "title": "Nvidia Is Buying Shares of These 5 AI Companies. Should You Do the Same?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the most closely watched companies in the world. It was once primarily known as a top supplier of gaming GPUs for PCs, but it subsequently evolved into the dominant producer of high-end data center GPUs.\n\nNvidia now generates most of its revenue from its data center GPUs, and demand for those chips is still outstripping supply as the artificial intelligence (AI) market expands. That's why its stock rallied more than 3,000% over the past five years, and why it's considered a linchpin and bellwether of the AI industry. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia could still have plenty of room to run as more companies launch AI applications, but the chipmaker has also been buying up shares of smaller AI companies. Let's look at five of those investments and see whether they could have a spot in your portfolio.\n\nWhich five stocks did Nvidia invest in?\n\nIn a 13F filing earlier this year, Nvidia disclosed its investments in five companies as of Dec. 31, 2023: SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX), Nano-X Imaging(NASDAQ: NNOX), and TuSimple Holdings. Here's how much Nvidia invested in each of those companies, and how much their shares have rallied or declined since that disclosure.\n\nCompany Shares Bought Market Value 12/31/2023 Market Value 7/6/2024 Gain (Loss) SoundHound AI 1,730,883 $3.67 million $7.25 million 98% Arm Holdings 1,960,784 $147.34 million $355.27 million 141% Recursion Pharmaceuticals 7,706,363 $75.98 million $56.41 million (26%) Nano-X Imaging 59,632 $0.38 million $0.41 million 8% TuSimple Holdings* 3,465,372 $3.04 million $0.87 million (71%)\n\nData source: Nvidia. *TuSimple delisted itself from the Nasdaq and moved to the OTC market in January 2024.\n\nSome of these bets are more speculative than the others\n\nSoundHound AI and Arm generated much bigger gains than the other three stocks. SoundHound develops audio and speech recognition technologies, and its Houndify platform has been used to create customized voice tools for automakers like Hyundai, smart-TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken.\n\nArm designs power-efficient chips that are used in about 99% of the world's premium smartphones. Chipmakers like Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple all license Arm's designs for their own mobile chips. Nvidia also licenses Arm's designs for its Tegra CPUs, which are used in set-top boxes, Nintendo's Switch consoles, and automotive infotainment systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has been bullish on both of these AI companies for a long time. It was one of SoundHound's earliest investors when it was still a start-up, and it nearly acquired Arm for $40 billion before antitrust regulators scuttled the deal in 2022.\n\nRecursion, Nano-X, and TuSimple are smaller and more speculative companies. Recursion uses AI algorithms to process drug discovery tests, Nano-X is a producer of digital X-ray sources and develops AI tools for identifying undetected chronic diseases, and TuSimple is a Chinese autonomous trucking company.\n\nWhich of these stocks are worth buying?\n\nOut of these five companies, only Arm is consistently profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. Therefore, it's easier to compare these five stocks using their estimated revenue growth and enterprise values.\n\nCompany Revenue (Last Fiscal Year) Enterprise Value EV/Revenue Ratio (Current Fiscal Year) Estimated CAGR (Next 2 Fiscal Years) SoundHound AI $45.9 million $1.3 billion 20 50% Arm Holdings $3.2 billion $185.1 billion 47 23% Recursion Pharmaceuticals $44.6 million $1.6 billion 27 19% Nano-X Imaging $9.9 million $395.3 million 25 130% TuSimple Holdings $0.3 million $60.9 million 198 N/A*\n\nData source: Marketscreener. *Due to delisting from Nasdaq. CAGR = compound annual growth rate.\n\nNone of these stocks look cheap right now, but SoundHound arguably looks like the most reasonably valued one relative to its growth potential. Arm runs a more stable business, but its valuation has been inflated by the buying frenzy in AI stocks.\n\nRecursion and Nano-X are developing promising technologies, but they haven't scaled up their businesses yet. As for TuSimple, the autonomous trucking company was caught in the crossfire of the escalating tech war between the U.S. and China, and it voluntarily delisted its shares from the Nasdaq earlier this year. That lack of visibility, along with its steep losses and sky-high valuation, make it a tough stock to recommend.\n\nShould you follow Nvidia's lead?\n\nThese five stocks are all tiny investments for Nvidia, which ended its latest quarter with $7.59 billion in cash and equivalents. The GPU giant won't lose much sleep if one of these companies goes under, but growth-oriented investors should stick with the two most established companies -- namely, Arm and SoundHound -- and simply keep an eye on the more speculative ones for now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Long-term investing is the key to generating sustainable returns in the stock market. Perhaps few will understand this better than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders, who have enjoyed total returns of more than 3,000% during the past five years despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and rising interest rates, which crushed many stocks in the short term.\n\nBut what could the next half-decade have in store for this powerful technology leader?\n\nThe king of the AI opportunity\n\nSince the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry has scrambled to accumulate generative artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, such as Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide the processing power necessary to run and train AI's complex algorithms. Nvidia's second-quarter earnings demonstrate how this new demand has transformed its operations.\n\nRevenue doubled year over year to $13.51 billion, driven by sales of high-end data center GPUs such as the H100. Profits jumped eightfold to $6.18 billion. And management aims to extend the company's dominance by accelerating the pace at which it releases new AI chips from biennially to annually, which will put even more pressure on its competition.\n\nNvidia is also expanding into new opportunities like custom chips, a $30 billion opportunity to serve clients with needs for their AI workloads that aren't as well-served by one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\nAll in all, the company looks capable of maintaining its 80% market share in the AI chip sector for the next five years and possibly beyond.\n\nThe valuation isn't as good as it looks\n\nThough its market cap has more than doubled in 2024 alone, Nvidia stock may seem reasonably priced when measured against its bottom line. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of about 49, the company's expected future earnings are valued at a premium to the NASDAQ 100's average of 29 -- no surprise considering the company's growth rate (first quarter earnings soared 628% year over year to $14.9 billion). But this situation is much more complicated than it looks on the surface.\n\nMost of today's large tech companies built up their earnings over decades with businesses well integrated into the productive economy. But this is not necessarily the case for most of Nvidia's explosive growth since 2022. The chipmaker has become overreliant on the speculative AI industry, which currently isn't generating much in the way of either earnings or cash flow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAccording to Sequoia Capital, the AI industry has already spent $50 billion on Nvidia's AI chips, while generative AI start-ups have only earned $3 billion in revenue. In other words, so far, the AI boom has been based on the proverbial selling picks and shovels to miners instead of actually getting gold out of the ground. This is an unsustainable situation -- unless things change, eventually, those \"miners\" won't be able to afford their hardware expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nBearing this uncomfortable fact in mind, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap, because its current valuation assumes demand for AI GPUs will remain elevated. And this is far from guaranteed.\n\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nOver the long term, Nvidia could sail through some of its biggest near-term challenges. While many consumer-facing AI businesses are losing money right now, they could eventually mature into profitable enterprises capable of sustaining enormous spending on Nvidia chips.\n\nThe industry could also diversify with contributions from AI use cases like self-driving cars and robotics, which would be great news for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nBut these are all what-if scenarios. And with Nvidia's stock currently priced for perfection, betting on this long-term thesis looks risky. It may make more sense to hold off until more information becomes available.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The stock market has shown remarkable resilience in the first half of 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs despite economic uncertainty. Chipmakers and AI-related companies have been standout market-beating stocks. Meanwhile, other sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary are also driving much of the index\u2019s gains.\n\nHere are seven market-beating stocks that have high growth potential and are starting to outperform the stock market and still have room to run higher.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a tear lately. Most growth investors are kicking themselves for not buying shares sooner. The stock has tripled year-to-date, recently hitting fresh highs above $900.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSMCI is riding major tailwinds from the AI boom. It produces critical server technology, and partners closely with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power data centers. Some analysts even view Super Micro as an \u201cAI proxy\u201d that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia starts to wane.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials look stellar too, with revenue surging over 200% last quarter. And I don\u2019t see this slowing down anytime soon. Super Micro has its finger on the pulse of several key megatrends like cloud computing, AI and data centers that should provide a long growth runway.\n\nSure, the stock isn\u2019t cheap at 38 times forward earnings, but I think that\u2019s more than justified, given the explosive growth. A few analysts have lofty price targets of up to $1,500. Of course, there are risks, but all things considered I\u2019m very bullish.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor powerhouse that provides chips for a wide range of applications. The company\u2019s stock has surged over 21% in the past month alone and nearly doubled over the past year.\n\nBroadcom recently posted a strong earnings beat primarily driven by insatiable demand for its AI-focused chips. Management is now forecasting $11 billion in AI-related revenue for the full year. Thus, Broadcom is now one of the market-beating stocks for investors looking to ride the AI megatrend alongside Nvidia.\n\nWhile the analyst community is largely bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus and a flurry of price target hikes, I do have some reservations about Broadcom\u2019s lofty valuation. The stock is priced for perfection with a forward P/E ratio pushing 37x.\n\nSo, where do I stand? I believe Broadcom\u2019s strong positioning in AI and cloud computing can power robust growth ahead. As long as the AI hype stays, AVGO should outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the company behind the current AI rally, as it initially made large investments into OpenAI. It also has productivity tools that the white-collar sector cannot survive without. It is hard to find a single tech field in which this company is not, or has not, competed.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on market leader Amazon Web Services. Azure gained 31% market share last quarter thanks in large part to surging demand for AI services. Microsoft\u2019s close partnership with OpenAI and its Copilot AI offerings are also fueling excitement. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 already using Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish, with Piper Sandler recently reiterating a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and $465 price target on the stock. However, some caution Microsoft\u2019s valuation is getting stretched, with the average analyst price target implying just 7% upside from current levels.\n\nNonetheless, I believe Microsoft\u2019s strong positioning in AI, cloud and other growth markets should continue to propel shares higher. The company\u2019s ability to drive synergies across its sprawling product portfolio is a key competitive advantage that the market still underappreciates.\n\nHEICO Corporation (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) has been riding high lately, and I believe the aerospace and defense powerhouse is well-positioned to continue its impressive run. The company recently reported stellar Q2 2024 results. Earnings per share of 88 cents handily beat estimates by 8 cents. And, revenue soared 39% year-over-year to $955 million. The Flight Support Group has been the key driver of this growth. market-beating stocks: HEI FSG segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHEICO is benefiting from several powerful megatrends in its core markets. Air travel demand has come roaring back post-pandemic. This has driven strong sales of HEICO\u2019s cost-saving aftermarket parts to airlines looking to keep aging fleets flying. The company is also seeing robust growth in its defense business as geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine spur higher military spending globally.\n\nAnalysts are taking notice of HEICO\u2019s momentum. In recent months, the stock has scored a slew of price target hikes from top firms like Bank of America, Truist, and RBC Capital. While HEICO shares don\u2019t come cheap at 64 times forward earnings, I believe the premium valuation is justified given the company\u2019s exceptional growth profile, high-margin business model, and significant runway in both commercial aerospace and defense.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has faced its share of challenges, from losing market share in desktop CPUs to AMD to delays in getting its AI chips to market. But there are also some promising tailwinds that could help turn things around.\n\nFor one, Intel is getting a major boost from the U.S. government to the tune of $8.5 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act to bolster its AI capabilities. That\u2019s a huge vote of confidence. Intel is also generating buzz with its upcoming Lunar Lake chip, which is supposed to deliver big performance gains for AI workloads in laptops. Analysts at Melius Research even predict Intel could be poised for a second-half rebound as an \u201cAI laggard\u201d that\u2019s ready to play catch-up.\n\nIf Intel can execute on its product roadmap, ride the coattails of the generative AI megatrend, and make the most of its government support, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the stock surprise to the upside. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one that I believe could pay off for patient investors willing to look past the near-term noise.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) has been riding high, and I\u2019m quite bullish on the stock. The drone and missile maker reported stellar Q4 results that blew past expectations, with earnings of 43 cents per share crushing estimates. Revenue also hit a record $197 million. Looking ahead, AeroVironment sees clear skies, guiding for nearly 12% top-line growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company is benefiting from soaring demand for its cutting-edge drone tech, especially its Switchblade loitering munitions that have proven highly effective on the battlefield. With rising geopolitical tensions, military spending should provide a nice tailwind. UnCrewed and Loitering Munitions segments have seen exceptional growth. AVAV UnCrewed Systems sales chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com AVAV Loitering Munitions sales chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThat said, not everyone is sold. Some analysts argue the impressive headline numbers mask underlying concerns about profitability. Shares dipped nearly 4% after the report.\n\nRegardless, the Street is getting more optimistic, with earnings upgrades and price target hikes. Given AeroVironment\u2019s strong positioning in the fast-growing drone space and ability to outpace the broader industry, I think the long-term trajectory remains positive. This is one of the market-beating stocks that is worth keeping on your radar.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been aggressively pushing into AI, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced just yet. The creative software giant recently posted solid Q2 2024 earnings that beat expectations, driven by strong growth in its Digital Media segment. Adobe is betting big that AI will expand its addressable market with innovations like its Firefly generative AI and new AI-powered tools for Photoshop, Acrobat and more.\n\nHowever, despite the recent spike, the stock is still down by 2% year-to-date. There are worries about rising competition from rivals like Canva and Microsoft in the generative AI space. Some analysts have also expressed skepticism about how quickly Adobe can monetize its AI investments. Citi warned that consensus estimates for the second half look \u201csomewhat aggressive.\u201d\n\nThat said, I remain optimistic about Adobe\u2019s long-term prospects. The shift to digital creativity and marketing shows no signs of slowing. Adobe\u2019s entrenched market position and strong brand give it a major advantage as it races to infuse AI across its product suite. Recent partner enthusiasm around offerings like GenStudio and Firefly Services is also encouraging. While the stock may stay volatile in the near term, patient investors could be rewarded as Adobe is among the market-beating stocks riding the AI wave.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Today, I\u2019ll share three undervalued growth stocks to buy in July.\n\nI\u2019ll name these three undervalued growth stocks and explain the factors that led me to conclude they are undervalued. I\u2019ll also explain how these growth stocks have performed in recent years to make them undervalued as of July 2024.\n\nChoosing undervalued growth stocks takes some research and analysis. It\u2019s not just looking at a chart. It means comparing the share price to its intrinsic value. Things like:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinancial performance. How much are the C-suite executives invested? Usefulness to society. Newly launched projects with a view to the future. And more.\n\nAny disparity between the above points and the stock price is an important indicator.\n\nWhile somewhat subjective, I initially researched nine potentially undervalued stocks and have arrived at three growth stocks that are undervalued right now in July.\n\nThese three stocks are undervalued for different reasons, as explained below. It\u2019s better because it casts a wider net in catching the \u201cbig fish.\u201d Here they are:\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) 2 Critical Reasons Uber Stock Will Weather the Pandemic\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is an undervalued growth stock with an asset-light business model that is attractive to large-scale growth.\n\nIn February, Uber announced a $7 billion buyback plan. This means Uber reduces the number of shares outstanding via those buybacks. Why? Because more of their profits can be directly sent back to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. So, as Uber grows and its cash flow expands, more of the money can be returned to shareholders. Bottom line, this means increasing earnings per share for each investor.\n\nUber has grown big enough to command a network effect in the industry. Uber has become a verb. You \u201cUber it\u201d like you \u201cGoogle it,\u201d and that is a self-generating network effect.\n\nBecause millions of users use Uber\u2019s food delivery and ride-sharing apps, unsurprisingly, they\u2019ve both done well as economies have reopened since the lockdowns.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe next undervalued growth stock on the list is PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). PayPal is benefiting from consumer behavior normalizing online. In the past five years, consumer behavior has undergone some never-before-seen changes. First, with the lockdowns when customers spent enormous sums of money online because they couldn\u2019t spend money in person.\n\nAs economies reopened, those behaviors shifted. People unleashed pent-up demand for away-from-home experiences such as vacations and eating out. That was bad news for PayPal but good news for investors looking for undervalued growth stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayPal benefits when consumers are spending more money online. Its app is more helpful to online shoppers. But when people are shopping in person, there is no benefit to use PayPal.\n\nPayPal stock is currently trading at a bottom around $60, down from around $300 during its lockdown highs.\n\nSo now that online consumer behavior is normalizing, PYPL will benefit from that trend. At relatively cheap valuations (its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14.2x), consumer behavior is leaning in PayPal\u2019s favor.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nLastly, there\u2019s Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Watching what those in the know do with their stocks is always a good idea. Well, who could be more in the know than the C-suite executives? So let\u2019s see what they\u2019re doing:\n\nThe founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, owns 868 million shares of his company, which shows great confidence. That\u2019s just over $1 billion worth.\n\nLikewise, CFO Colette Kress owns 6.43 million shares.\n\nLast week, I made the case for NVDA to be a candidate to sell, but only partially if investors are already looking at a profit. That\u2019s exactly what Huang and Kress did in June in what looked like a response to NVDA\u2019s 10-to-1 stock split. But tellingly, they still hold around 90% of their remaining shares.\n\nNormally, it is wise to wait for a dip before buying a stock, but Nvidia hasn\u2019t been behaving that way. Since pivoting to the AI sector, NVDA has been backing thousands of AI startups in Europe alone, and its growth is not stopping.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sam Farnham did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "The mega-hype surrounding Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA)10-for-1 stock split and its brief stint as the most valuable company on the market is in the past, but Nvidia still might be the most closely followed stock in the investing community today.\n\nHowever, since it has gained nearly 700% over the past two years, some investors are concerned about how much higher it can go in the near term. Several billionaires have been pocketing some of their gains and using them to fund other investments that might have more near-term fuel.\n\nSome examples are Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who sold 2,409,326 shares of Nvidia in the 2024 first quarter, or 64% of his fund's position; Ken Griffin of Citadel, who sold 883,563 shares, or 43% of his position; and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma, who sold 451,464 shares, or 77% of their position.\n\nInstead, all four billionaire investors bought a different artificial intelligence (AI) stock: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Englander bought 2,476,287 shares, or 34% more; Griffin added 4,673,930 shares, a 246% increase; and Overdeck and Siegel added 364,950 shares to their position, a 41% increase.\n\nShould investors follow their lead?\n\nAmazon might be the best AI stock to buy today\n\nNvidia and Amazon are both deeply invested in the generative AI revolution, but they run very different businesses and even work together. Nvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power generative AI, which is the main reason its stock has skyrocketed over the past two years, while Amazon is developing applications to make generative AI work.\n\nAmazon has rolled out a competitive set of generative AI applications that help developers create powerful tools to make businesses run better. These are directed at Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients. This is Amazon's cloud computing segment, and it's the leading global provider of cloud services.\n\nSome tools include chatbots and virtual assistants that can take some of the load away from human customer-service agents, freeing up resources and leading to higher efficiency; code prompts for developers, who can use more time for creative processes instead of manual coding; and high-level data analytics that can help companies make faster, more accurate decisions.\n\nOf the many companies that are already using these tools, one example Amazon highlighted is DoorDash, which used AWS generative AI tools to build a self-service contact center for its delivery personnel.\n\nThis is an incredible opportunity for several reasons. As the largest cloud computing company in the world, Amazon stands to benefit from clients moving over to these tools, and it can also attract new clients to maintain and grow its lead. According to management, company spending on cloud tools is still a small percentage of total information-technology expense, leaving a wide gap that's ripe for the taking.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is already on the upswing again after facing inflationary pressure. Sales increased 17% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and management says trends are stabilizing after clients went through some cost-optimization.\n\nIt's not just AI\n\nAmazon uses AI throughout its operations, which it has been doing since well before AI became an investor buzzword.\n\nMachine learning and data analytics are at the root of Amazon's e-commerce business. They offer recommendations for customers looking for a specific product, along with instant comparisons between similar products to help customers choose and convert higher sales. It also uses these kinds of tools in its vast delivery network to make instant calculations about the fastest and cheapest routes to get an order fulfilled.\n\nThe company is using the same infrastructure to build up its advertising business. There might not be any better platform for Amazon's third-party vendors to advertise their products than on its site, where hundreds of millions of Prime members and other shoppers are already looking for their products.\n\nThe company can send the right ads to the right shoppers with unmatched accuracy, increasing sales for vendors and Amazon, and increasing the success of its ad business.\n\nAmazon stock is a rock\n\nNvidia is still an excellent company with strong long-term growth drivers, but investors are worried that with a high valuation and increasing competition, it could have some of its growth priced in. Nvidia stock is already down slightly from its recent jump that resulted from its split.\n\nAmazon stock, on the other hand, is demonstrating strong and steady growth. It's up 32% this year but only 9% over the past three years -- in other words, it only recently surpassed its previous high, so you can still get in while it's climbing. The company has massive long-term opportunities, and investors can feel confident following billionaire investors into a position, or increasing a position, in Amazon stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The AI juggernaut that has powered the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) rally this year is expected to keep fueling returns over the next six to 12 months, according to BlackRock analysts.\n\n\"A case can still be made to be risk on,\u201d Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said during a media roundtable on Tuesday.\n\nReasons Li and her team are bullish on equities include companies' enormous capital expenditures on AI and increasing demand for low-carbon energy. Investments in AI data centers, for example, are expected to rise by 60%-100% annually in the coming years, said Li.\n\n\"When we add up all this cap-ex spend we get to numbers rarely seen in history comparable to the Industrial Revolution,\" she said.\n\nAs of early July, a record $6.15 trillion was sitting in money market funds as the S&P 500 notched 36 record highs this year.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, the S&P 500 gained 14.5%, with a handful of stocks leading those gains. Notably, AI heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) accounted for roughly one-third of the S&P 500's gains during the first six months of the year, while an outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech has contributed to earnings growth in the S&P 500 year over year.\n\nHowever, BlackRock strategists don\u2019t see the concentration of equity performance as a problem as megacaps have delivered on earnings. They expect large technology companies to invest heavily in the AI build-out and chip producers and firms supplying energy and utilities to continue to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe think markets are likely to keep rewarding perceived AI winners in the next six to 12 months \u2013 regardless of where the transformation leads longer term,\u201d said the asset management firm\u2019s 2024 Midyear Global Outlook.\n\nInvestors should consider \u201cleaning into risk, stepping away from cash, and really thinking of pockets where there are opportunities,\u201d said Gargi Chaudhuri, chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas at BlackRock.\n\nSuch pockets include Energy, Health Care, and Utilities \u2014 sectors that are set to benefit from the AI boom.\n\nThe growing need to power everything from data centers to chip manufacturing plants has sent the S&P 500 Utilities ETF (XLU) up more than 8% year to date, compared to a loss of about 7% in 2023.\n\nThe strategists say risks that could slow down or interrupt AI's build-out and adoption include potential challenges from policy and regulations, rules on the use of AI, and supply bottlenecks amid growing demand for metals and minerals like copper, aluminum, and lithium.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "5 Super Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution",
        "content": "In 2016, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang personally delivered the first artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputer to OpenAI. In hindsight, that was a significant moment in history because the start-up went on to develop one of the AI industry's most advanced applications, ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT and many of its competitors can already generate text, images, videos, and computer code on command. But Nvidia and its peers are designing hardware that is more powerful and more energy efficient, paving the way for the development of even better AI applications with expanded capabilities.\n\nHere are five semiconductor stocks investors might want to buy during the AI revolution. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is best known for designing the most powerful data center graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development. But the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform is an entire cloud-based operating system for AI developers that extends far beyond chips alone.\n\nThe platform offers developers a library of ready-made large language models (LLMs) they can use to build AI applications, which can save them substantial amounts of time and money. It's also home to CUDA (the software layer of the GPU), which allows developers to optimize their chips so they can build applications more quickly. CUDA can't be used with any other chips, so data center operators need to stick with Nvidia's hardware or risk upsetting customers who are proficient with the software.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the benchmark in the AI industry, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its Blackwell architecture. The upcoming GB200 GPU, for example, can can perform AI inference at five times the speed of the H100, which will reduce costs for developers, who often pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia stock has tripled over the past year alone, and it probably isn't done moving higher. Wall Street thinks the company will bring in over $120 billion in revenue during the current 2025 fiscal year (ending Jan. 30, 2025), which is nearly double its result from fiscal 2024. The majority of that revenue will come from its AI-focused data center segment.\n\n2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n\nNvidia is struggling to meet demand for its GPUs, so some of its biggest customers are turning to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) instead. AMD's MI300 GPU is winning over data center titans like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, which have found that it offers inference performance and cost advantages over the H100.\n\nAMD's data center revenue surged 80% to $2.3 billion during the recent first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31). The company expects to generate $4 billion in sales from its GPUs alone this year, which is up from a January forecast of $3.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut AMD has taken a leadership position in another crucial area of AI: personal computing. It says millions of PCs fitted with its Ryzen AI chips have shipped to date -- from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus -- giving AMD a 90% market share in this segment.\n\nThe company is working closely with Microsoft to develop new Ryzen chips capable of processing the growing suite of AI features built into the Windows operating system.\n\nAMD stock is up 51% over the past year, but it remains 18% below its all-time high. Now might be a great time to buy as the company's AI revenue ramps up in both the data center and PC segments.\n\n3. Axcelis Technologies\n\nUnlike Nvidia and AMD, Axcelis Technologies(NASDAQ: ACLS) doesn't produce any chips. It makes ion implantation equipment that is crucial for the fabrication of processors (CPUs), memory chips, and storage chips. AI applications require higher capacities from all three, which presents a big opportunity for this company.\n\nMost of Nvidia's data center GPUs have built-in memory, and advanced models like the Blackwell GB200 even come with built-in CPUs for higher efficiency.\n\nPlus, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require more processing power and up to twice as much memory capacity as their predecessors. As a result, Axcelis CEO Russell Low says AI will require significant manufacturing capacity expansions throughout the semiconductor industry, which should lead to more sales of the company's equipment.\n\nIn addition, power devices (chips that regulate the flow of electrical power in high-current workloads) are very implant-intensive to manufacture. Demand is rapidly growing for AI data centers, which is driving up demand for energy generation, distribution, and cooling. And that, in turn, drives up demand for Axcelis' equipment.\n\nDespite soaring 835% over the last five years, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 18.7, which is a 49% discount to the 36.9 P/E of the iShares Semiconductor ETF. In other words, Axcelis stock would have to almost double just to trade in line with its peers in the chip industry. That spells opportunity for investors.\n\n4. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a multifaceted AI play. It makes hardware and software networking solutions for data centers, including its switches, which regulate how quickly data travels between servers and devices. They are key components when thousands of GPUs are clustered together to process vast amounts of data in AI development.\n\nDuring the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended May 5), sales of Broadcom's Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3 switches doubled compared to the year-ago period.\n\nMany of its subsidiaries are also using AI. It acquired Symantec for $10.7 billion in 2019, which is using Alphabet's Vertex AI platform to bring AI to its cybersecurity software. Broadcom also acquired cloud software provider VMware for $69 billion in 2023, which allows developers to create virtual machines. This means multiple users can plug into one server to use all of its capacity, which is important during a time when AI infrastructure is in short supply.\n\nBroadcom says its companywide AI revenue soared 280% year over year to $3.1 billion during the second quarter. The company expects to deliver a record high $51 billion in total revenue for the whole of fiscal 2024, with $11 billion coming from AI specifically.\n\n5. Micron Technology\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, AI-enabled PCs and smartphones require significantly more memory capacity than non-AI devices. That's because AI applications need mountains of data to function, and memory chips serve as a brain that temporarily stores that information in a ready state. Micron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) is a leading provider of memory and storage chips, and it's experiencing a wave of demand as a result of the AI revolution.\n\nEvery tier 1 manufacturer of Android-based AI smartphones (like Samsung) uses Micron's\u00a0 LPDDR5X memory chip. It offers between 12 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes of capacity, which is 50% to 100% more memory than previous flagship smartphones required. Plus, the minimum memory requirement for Microsoft's new Copilot+ AI PCs is 16 gigabytes, which is twice the minimum amount its previous Surface lineup needed. This trend spells more revenue for Micron.\n\nOn the data center side, Micron's HBM3e (high-bandwidth memory) solution is used in Nvidia's new H200 GPU. It can perform AI inference at almost twice the speed of the H100 while consuming half the amount of energy, which translates to substantial cost savings for data center operators.\n\nMicron says HBM3e contributed $100 million to its revenue during the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended May 30). By the end of fiscal 2024, it expects to have sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth -- but that is forecast to grow into the billions of dollars in fiscal 2025.\n\nMicron is already completely sold out of HBM3e memory for the next two years, which should give the company an incredible amount of pricing power and, therefore, drive significant growth in its profitability.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.
