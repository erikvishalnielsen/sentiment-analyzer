        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest holding of the KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), accounting for about 8.6% of the total assets.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d with its \u201cCopilot strategy\u201d for the back half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet earnings top estimates as cloud business gains steam, AI losses grow",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, as its cloud businesses continue to pick up steam, topping the $1 billion mark for operating profit for the first time.\n\nFor the quarter, the company saw earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.7 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's a jump from the same period last year of 31% and 14%, respectively, when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nAdvertising revenue topped $64.6 billion versus analysts' expectations of $64.5 billion, and up from $58.1 billion last year. YouTube ad revenue, however, fell short, with the segment bringing in $8.66 billion versus expectations of $8.95 billion.\n\nShares of Alphabet were flat immediately following the announcement.\n\nGoogle saw cloud revenue of $10.35 billion and operating income of $1.17 billion. That's better than analyst expectations of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million, and higher than the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. When exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google\u2019s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\n\u201cIt is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note ahead of Alphabet's earnings announcement.\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren\u2019t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it spends on AI, Alphabet has been cutting in other areas including headcount. In Q2, the company reported having 179,582 employees, down from 181,798 in the same period last year. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Investing.com - Jefferies released a research note on Tuesday, highlighting the need for tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to accelerate its software momentum.\n\nDespite IBM 's outperformance of the IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF) by 7% YTD, Jefferies believes that the company's stock is likely to remain range-bound, with modest growth in the 3-4% range.\n\nThe three key areas analysts are monitoring include software growth, consulting, and AI contribution. The firm anticipates challenges in software growth due to tougher comparisons, and in consulting, which missed revenue expectations and saw a lowered guidance in the first quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Jefferies does not expect AI to make a significant contribution to the software sector this year.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIBM, often referred to as 'Big Blue', is seen as a slow-moving entity, with Wall Street predicting just 1% total revenue growth in 2Q and a 15% free cash flow (FCF) margin. The sluggish growth expectations are largely due to the consulting segment, where other industry players such as Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) have reported ongoing uncertainty over discretionary spending projects.\n\nSoftware growth is projected to be 2.5% year-on-year, almost three times the overall revenue growth in 2Q. As IBM transitions towards a software-led model, the company's software performance is considered crucial for driving more substantial bottom-line growth. Software accounted for 40% of total revenue but approximately two-thirds of pre-tax income in CY23.\n\nIn 2Q, the software business is expected to contribute the majority of overall growth, as well as in FY24. The consensus estimate for software revenue in 2Q is $6.5 billion, representing a 2.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nJefferies emphasized the importance of strong execution in the Red Hat business and the successful integration of HCP for achieving sustainable software growth.\n\nThe consulting business growth expectations are relatively muted due to weaker near-term demand. However, Jefferies believes that AI will significantly benefit the consulting sector in the short term, with IBM recording over $1 billion of AI bookings over the last three quarters, primarily weighted towards consulting.\n\nAnalysts deemed the risk/reward as balanced, with IBM shares trading at 20 times CY25E EPS, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 32 times and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 28 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies maintained their 'Hold' rating for IBM with a price target of $190.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies analysis: IBM's future growth hinges on software momentum\n\nAfter-hours movers: Alphabet, Tesla, Texas Instruments, Seagate and more\n\nEnphase Energy's revenue reached $303.5 million\n\nView comments()",

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping Upcoming Results\n\nMicrosoft's performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to have shown robust growth, primarily driven by its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite, is likely to have contributed significantly to top-line growth.\r\n\r\nIn the Intelligent Cloud segment, the company anticipates revenues between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. Our model estimate for this segment is pegged at $28.54 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth in the range of 30-31% at cc. Microsoft's Azure platform is spearheading the company's AI-driven growth strategy.\r\n\r\nA key factor in Microsoft's growth strategy has been Teams, its enterprise communication platform. Teams has been expanding its customer base and feature set, effectively competing against rivals like Zoom. The platform's growth is closely tied to the rising popularity of hybrid and flexible work models. \r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, Microsoft announced that it is set to sell Teams separately from its Office product globally. The decision comes after the company unbundled the two products in Europe to avert a possible EU antitrust fine.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft anticipates its Productivity and Business Processes segment to generate revenues between $19.9 billion and $20.2 billion. Our model estimate is pegged at $20.03 billion, indicating an increase of 9.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nThis growth is underpinned by strong performance across various product lines. Office 365 Commercial is expected to see revenue growth of approximately 14% at constant currency (cc), which is in line with our model estimate. However, traditional Office Commercial products are projected to experience a decline in the mid-to-high teens range, highlighting the ongoing shift from on-premise to cloud-based solutions.\r\n\r\nThe company's diversified portfolio continues to show promise, with Office Consumer products and cloud services expected to achieve revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits. LinkedIn is projected to achieve mid-to-high single-digit growth. Our model estimate for LinkedIn is pegged at revenue growth of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nDynamics 365, Microsoft's enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management platform, is another steady performer, with the company projecting revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. \r\n\r\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, the company projects revenues between $15.2 billion and $15.6 billion. Revenues from Windows are likely to have been driven by steady traction seen in Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth amid improving personal computer (PC) demand.\r\n\r\nThe Traditional PC market delivered its second quarter of growth following eight consecutive quarters of decline. According to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker, worldwide shipments reached 64.9 million units in the second quarter of 2024, representing year-over-year growth of 3%.\r\n\r\nAmong other major PC vendors, Lenovo (LNVGY) and Hewlett Packard (HPE) registered an increase in shipments. Lenovo's shipments increased 3.7% year over year to 14.7 million units, while HPE's shipments grew 1.8% year over year to 13.7 million units. Additionally, Apple (AAPL) registered a 20.8% year-over-year improvement in shipments, reaching 5.7 million units.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects Windows OEM revenues to grow in the mid to low-to-mid single-digit range. In the Gaming segment, MSFT expects revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Furthermore, Microsoft anticipates Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s, driven by roughly 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced the renewal of a publishing agreement with NetEase, which will bring back Blizzard Entertainment's games like World of Warcraft to players in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nShares of MSFT have returned 17.8% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 21.5%. Shares of HPE and AAPL have gained 21.3% and 16.3%, respectively, while shares of LNVGY have declined 2.8%.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value Microsoft offers investors at current levels. MSFT is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 11.73X compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s 8.13X and higher than the median of 10.05X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nMSFT\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nMicrosoft presents a strong investment case with its dominant position in cloud computing (Azure) and productivity software (Office 365), driving consistent revenue growth. The company's strategic focus on AI integration and partnerships, like with OpenAI, positions it at the forefront of technological innovation. Microsoft's diversified portfolio, including gaming (Xbox) and professional networking (LinkedIn), provides stability and multiple growth avenues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, potential challenges include intense competition in the cloud market, particularly from Amazon and Google, and the cyclical nature of enterprise IT spending. Regulatory scrutiny over market dominance and data privacy concerns pose additional risks. Despite these challenges, Microsoft's strong balance sheet, consistent cash flow, and history of shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks make it an attractive option for investors seeking a balance of growth and stability in the tech sector.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicrosoft's strong performance in productivity and collaboration offerings is expected to drive substantial growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 despite a premium valuation and fierce competition in the cloud market. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, AI integration, and innovative product development has positioned it favorably in the competitive market. Maintaining a position in Microsoft appears prudent at present. Investors looking to buy the stock should, however, wait for a better entry point.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Buy Mag 7 Weakness?",
        "content": "Several Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\n\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks\u2019 runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Reaccelerates\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company\u2019s cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\n\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It\u2019s worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META\u2019s revenue.\n\nIn addition, META shares aren\u2019t expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company\u2019s outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\n\nNvidia Outlook Remains Robust\n\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\n\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\n\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks \u2013 Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\n\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\n\nNonetheless, these stocks\u2019 runs certainly aren\u2019t over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Cautious Optimism for Alibaba",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) has reported a mix of performance outcomes for fiscal year 2024. While the company's international commerce segment, under the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) division, has shown remarkable growth, it continues to face challenges within its core markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, Alibaba retains durable competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its leadership in mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics. The company's strategic investments in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers are promising, though their success is not guaranteed given the challenging macroeconomic environment and execution risks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nIn the near term, the stock is likely to remain volatile, reflecting the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if Alibaba can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, shares could potentially return over 30% within 12 months, according to analyst forecasts.\n\nAlibaba's path to growth: International success\n\nAlibaba posted 7% year-over-year revenue growth for the March quarter, but income from operations fell by 3%. Overall net income climbed for the entire 2024 fiscal year by 9%, but results have had to be more consistent recently.\n\nIndeed, it does not feel like stiff competition dented Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce operations. Its international retail division posted solid momentum driven by robust order growth on platforms such as AliExpress. Other initiatives, such as the AliExpress Choice initiative, further boosted performance, which improved the customer experience with better product selection. Cautious Optimism for Alibaba\n\nSource: Alibaba\n\nIn the wholesale space, Alibaba has enjoyed the benefit of delivering value-added services across borders. The Chinese wholesale commerce area is expanding. International commerce net revenues shifted back and forth for the group at $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected staggering year-over-year growth of 45%, which says a lot about the strong momentum of the company's international businesses recently.\n\nAs a final point, the company has increased its focus on the growth of its AliExpress platform through logistic integration with its Cainiao network. Alibaba aims to increase AliExpress' brand awareness and user experience globally by increasing investments in key markets across Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nA $5 billion buyback plan: A bold move amid investor concerns and market challenges\n\nIn May, Alibaba announced plans to raise $5 billion through a convertible bond offering. The company said proceeds would fund share buybacks at $80.80 per share. This suggests management sees value in repurchasing stock at current levels.\n\nHowever, some investors needed clarification on the deal's complex structure. There are also worries over how accessible the new cash on Alibaba's balance sheet will be for general corporate purposes.\n\nAnalysts see the potential for the stock to increase in value, but point to risks that limit the upside or lead to further declines. For instance, Hargreaves Lansdown notes some \"green shoots\" of improvement in Alibaba's business, but progress overall remains sluggish.\n\nSimilarly, Morningstar recently raised its price target for Alibaba by 2% to $96 per share, implying undervaluation. This target is based on expectations that consumer discretionary spending in China will rebound, allowing the company to regain market share and resume earnings growth. However, competition and regulatory hurdles remain top concerns.\n\nThe road ahead: Opportunities abound amid economic and competitive hurdles\n\nWhile Alibaba has promising opportunities in areas like international expansion and artificial intelligence, the company faces an uphill battle with numerous challenges impacting its business.\n\nThe country's gross domestic product growth has slowed to an estimated 3% to 4% annually from the 6% to 7% in earlier years. This slowdown, together with the impacts of Covid-19, weakened consumers' confidence and theatrically trimmed discretionary spending. Less demand among consumers is the last thing a company with a heavy dependence on Chinese retail, like Alibaba, would be concerned with.\n\nTogether with macroeconomic concerns, Alibaba is being competitively squeezed by some business lines. Within Chinese e-commerce, Alibaba has been losing market share to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings' (NASDAQ:PDD) Pinduoduo. The company's operations in this segment are growing only at single-digit rates year over yearpretty slow compared to the hypergrowth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses have attained.\n\nAlibaba Cloud faces uphill competition from dominant players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. These Western tech giants have far greater global brand recognition and trust than Alibaba Cloud.\n\nBetween economic struggles and fierce competition, there are legitimate concerns about Alibaba's ability to execute its growth strategy. The company's core commerce segment makes up most of the total revenue, so any deeper slowdown here would be very impactful.\n\nAlibaba is trying to expand into new frontiers in China and abroad, but execution risks are elevated given the challenging macro environment. More specifically, the Chinese retail landscape looks particularly challenging in the near term. Given economic uncertainties, consumer discretionary spending remains under pressure. This weighs heavily on Alibaba's massive e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, which rely on Chinese consumers' willingness to shop.\n\nOnly when broader consumer confidence rebounds will it be easier for the stock to recapture previous highs. Markets will watch closely for signs of stabilization in China's commerce trends. But the environment is likely to remain cloudy in the short term.\n\nThe takeaway: Cautious optimism\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still reasons for optimism if investors take a long-term view. While the stock has struggled recently, Alibaba retains competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics leadership. As China's economy expands over time, Alibaba is poised to benefit.\n\nThe company also has promising initiatives in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers. Significant investments in these areas could potentially pay off.\n\nHowever, Alibaba's growth trajectory remains unclear. Much depends on how successfully the company can execute new growth drivers while shoring up its core Chinese e-commerce operations. Investors need more evidence these investments will translate into profits.\n\nIn the near term, Alibaba's stock will likely remain volatile. The valuation reflects the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if the company can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the stock could potentially return over 30% within 12 months for investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, ongoing economic and regulatory headwinds in China make this a far from sure bet.\n\nUntil China's business climate stabilizes, investors may want to approach the stock cautiously. Consider waiting for clarity on Alibaba's growth rebound before making major positions, but keep it on your watchlist for when Chinese consumption trends improve.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Loves AI Stocks. Here Are 5 She Bought in the First Half of 2024.",
        "content": "It's not only their politicking that draws interest these days. With politicians demonstrating a remarkable ability to outperform the market, investors are increasingly interested in the stock picks of senators and representatives. Take the Peach State representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, who has been an avid buyer of stocks so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular that seem to be the focus of Greene's interest in the first half of 2024. In addition to AdvancedMicroDevices(NASDAQ: AMD), Greene also picked up shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nGreene gained broad exposure to the AI industry\n\nStarting her 2024 stock purchases in April, Greene bought shares of both Qualcomm and Microsoft. Although the exact value of the transactions isn't known, Greene reported in regulatory filings that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Both buys provided Greene with notable -- yet diverse -- exposure to the rapidly burgeoning AI industry.\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Qualcomm is targeting generative AI applications for mobile devices with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile platform. In addition, its providing AI functionality to personal computers with its Snapdragon X Elite Platform and automobiles with Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Focused on software, Microsoft's commitment to offering sophisticated AI solutions is demonstrated with Copilot -- an AI tool that is available across Microsoft's suite of products from Word and Excel to Designer, where users can create unique images with DALL-E 3.\n\nThe following month, Greene broadened her AI exposure with positions in Apple and Advanced Micro Devices in two transactions that were each valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Making a concerted effort to offer more AI capability, Apple has been working on its own large language model (LLM), dubbed Ajax. In early June, moreover, Apple revealed Apple Intelligence. Available on its various devices, Apple states that Apple Intelligence \"combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that's incredibly useful and relevant.\"\n\nLike Qualcomm, AMD also produces the hardware that's powering AI. In addition to its MI300 accelerators (specialized microprocessors) that are designed for generative AI and large language models, AMD manufactures Ryzen PRO 8000 processors, which the company characterizes as \"the first processors with dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators for commercial desktop [personal computers].\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late June, Greene clicked the \"buy\" button on cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike. Powered with AI, CrowdStrike helps clients protect a variety of devices including laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. In addition, CrowdStrike has developed a generative AI security tool, Charlotte AI, that integrates with various aspects of the company's Falcon platform.\n\nYou may be green with envy over Greene's picks, but that doesn't mean you should buy these AI stocks too\n\nWhile following politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy, blindly mimicking their buys is foolhardy at best. It's important for individual investors to do their due diligence and evaluate whether the stocks in question are smart choices for them. That being said, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple, and AMD are all industry leaders that are trading at premiums to their historical valuations.\n\nTherefore, value investors may want to keep these names on their watch lists instead of rushing to add them to their portfolios. Of course valuation isn't the only factor that investors should consider, so long-term investors may not want to investigate these tickers further before deciding to watch them from the side of the road.\n\nCrowdStrike, however, is in a different boat since it caused a global outage last week. With the sell-off that followed news of the global outage, CrowdStrike's stock is a lot less expensive today, giving back most of its 2024 gains. Inauspicious as the news may be for CrowdStrike, it's critical for investors to remember that this event, in and of itself, doesn't spell doom for the company.\n\nComputer code is complicated, and the flaw that was in the company's update is unfortunate but not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company. For those with the resolve to weather some near-term volatility, CrowdStrike may be a great addition for investors looking for a leading cybersecurity stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Just last Wednesday, I posted a column reporting how our richest corporations, through sheer miserliness and profit-seeking, left millions of Americans vulnerable to technological attacks on their privacy and welfare.\n\nI failed to raise one important question: What if the attacks come from inside the house?\n\nThat's exactly what happened Friday. An ineptly designed update to a program rolled out by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and installed automatically on users' machines instantly crashed millions of computers running Microsoft programs and left them disabled until manual fixes could be undertaken. Some haven't been fixed yet.\n\nCrowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control.\n\nBusiness blogger Ed Zitron\n\nThe fallout reached worldwide and affected people across the modern technological landscape. Thousands of flights were canceled. Doctors couldn't perform surgeries. Banking transactions were frozen. Emergency 911 lines went silent.\n\nThe affected computers displayed what Microsoft Windows users know as the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" Typically, this is a baby-blue screen bearing the message that Microsoft's operating system hadn't loaded correctly and the machine should be restarted.\n\nThat didn't work this time: The errant CrowdStrike application was burrowed so deep within the Microsoft operating system \u2014 as it's designed to be \u2014 that every time a machine restarted, it ran into the same glitch and went dead again in an infinite doom loop.\n\nThe CrowdStrike program \u2014 irony of ironies \u2014 is an anti-hacking application that identifies hacking attempts and fights them off. In the cat-and-mouse game pitting computer users against hackers, such applications have to be updated regularly. They reside in the bowels of the operating system, because in order to be effective, they have to load before almost any other function.\n\nIn this case, a coding error in the update delivered an order to the operating system that caused the system to shut down.\n\nThat's a simplified explanation of what happened. Now let's look at the lessons this episode teaches us \u2014 if we're willing to learn them.\n\nThey have to do with our complacency about our dependence on digital systems, including those distributed by developers we've never heard of (CrowdStrike, for instance).\n\nWhat few people are aware of as they go about their lives is how much crucial digital infrastructure is based on Microsoft programs and applications, and how much of those are supplemented by third-party programs and applications.\n\nAll of this must work together to work smoothly \u2014 or to appear to work smoothly. Here and there something goes wrong, but its ramifications are sufficiently constrained that it can be rectified quickly, and even invisibly.\n\nRead more:Column: After a years-long pause, the FCC resurrects 'network neutrality,' a boon for consumers\n\nA great deal of it, furthermore, is automated; it's designed to run with a minimum of human intervention. In the view of the IT departments that are expected to monitor all this, humans are perpetual money pits \u2014 they need days off, get sick, demand raises, quit and must be replaced by newbies needing training, etc., etc. By comparison, machines look like a one-time capital expense \u2014 set it and forget it, is the goal.\n\nMicrosoft is the hub of these networks because Microsoft made them its business. It created an open architecture for third-party developers to piggyback on; the fundamental idea was that by extending the system's capabilities, those other developers made Microsoft's central system more valuable. Microsoft either outsourced some functions to independent developers, or allowed them to design applications that competed with Microsoft's versions \u2014 but those still were designed to work with Microsoft operability.\n\nAmong those developers is Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike, one of countless firms offering cybersecurity services to Windows users. (Microsoft's own cybersecurity suite is known as Defender.)\n\nApple computers and devices don't have the same vulnerabilities because that company does almost all its extensions in-house, and keeps a very close eye on what it allows to interact with its software and hardware; the company doesn't allow outside applications to interact with its operating system at the fundamental level available with Microsoft's systems.\n\nBut Apple doesn't have anywhere near as large a footprint in enterprise services as Microsoft. A report issued in March by the government's Cyber Safety Review Board about a major hacking intrusion into Microsoft's cloud system in March 2023 asserted that the company's \"ubiquitous and critical products ... underpin essential services that support national security, the foundations of our economy, and public health and safety.\"\n\nAnyone living in the modern world has to confront the drawbacks of our reliance on digital technology on almost a daily basis. In prehistoric days, back when our household appliances were mechanical or electric, not electronic, a breakdown was easy to diagnose and fix \u2014 switch out a tube or tighten a screw.\n\nWhen a device ceases to function today, it's often impossible to pinpoint the fault \u2014 did my TV go bad, or did the internet go down, or was it just the channel I was watching?\n\nRead more:Column: 60 years ago in Los Angeles, piano virtuoso Glenn Gould revolutionized the music industry by ending his concert career\n\nYet many of us rely on a single company for multiple services. For example, I get my home phone service, broadband internet, and television/video (broadcast and cable channels and streaming) from a single provider. I don't have much choice, since for most of these it's the only provider in my neighborhood. But when it goes down, everything goes down.\n\nThat provider, Spectrum, has tried to sell me on its mobile phone service too. I've refused, because I figure I need at least one thread of access to the outside world that isn't dependent on its all-in-one monopoly.\n\nMicrosoft's near-dominance of cloud computing \u2014 the ecosystem through which all those enterprise computers that went dead last week communicate with each other and with the outside world \u2014 should make all of us queasy, because the company's cybersafety record is atrocious.\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board investigation concluded that the March 2023 hack occurred because \"Microsoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light of the company\u2019s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of trust customers place in the company to protect their data and operations.\"\n\nThe board mentioned, among other things, a \"cascade of ... avoidable errors\" in the company's cybersecurity program, its failure to detect the compromise by hackers of its own \"cryptographic crown jewels\"\u2014it acted only the U.S. State Department discovered the incursion and alerted Microsoft.\n\nThe board found that Microsoft's security practices were inferior to those of \"other cloud service providers.\" The report mentioned Amazon, Google and Oracle as Microsoft rivals in cloud services with better security systems.\n\nMicrosoft pledged to \"adopt a new culture of engineering security in our own networks\" and said it had \"mobilized our engineering teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes, and enforce security benchmarks.\"\n\nThe CrowdStrike crash suggests that those efforts are still works in progress. It's fair to say that much of the blame for the outage belongs to CrowdStrike, which allowed an update to a crucial application to be sent to users for automatic installation without doing the testing necessary to ensure that the update was operationally bulletproof.\n\nTechnology blogger Ed Zitron properly tied the disaster to the financialization of Big Business generally, in which pumping ever higher profits to shareholders becomes a higher priority than ensuring that one's products meet quality standards.\n\n\"Crowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control,\" Zitron wrote, \"except instead of building planes where the doors fly off at the most inopportune times (specifically, when you\u2019re cruising at 35,000ft), it released a piece of software that blew up the transportation and banking sectors, to name just a few.\"\n\nRead more:Column: Excited about AI and self-driving cars? A top roboticist is here to burst your bubble\n\nCrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz moved promptly to \"sincerely apologize\" to all affected users, via a statement and an appearance on the NBC \"Today\" show. \"We quickly identified the issue and deployed a fix, allowing us to focus diligently on restoring customer systems as our highest priority,\" Kurtz said in a posting on the company's website.\n\nMicrosoft placed the blame chiefly on CrowdStrike. \"Although this was not a Microsoft incident, given it impacts our ecosystem, we want to provide an update on the steps we\u2019ve taken with CrowdStrike and others to remediate and support our customers,\" David Weston, a vice president for enterprise and security, wrote on the company's website.\n\nBut Microsoft, plainly, failed to take on board the necessity of vetting every piece of third-party software that could have an effect on its own customers \u2014 before it blew up their computer systems.\n\nNo software system is immune from errors, especially now that they're so complex and multilayered that not even their developers may know all their weak spots. (An error at Amazon's cloud service incapacitated as many as 150,000 websites for several hours in February 2017 \u2014 a major problem, but not nearly on the scale of the CrowdStrike crash.)\n\nBut as these systems play an ever-expanding role in modern life even as they become more complex, it's incumbent on their providers to make security and safety their top priorities, not merely mouth the concept in marketing material without actually taking it seriously.\n\nCloud clients also need to pay more attention to what is getting automatically inserted into their systems. Who has the right to gloat over escaping the CrowdStrike meltdown last week? Amusingly, it's Southwest Airlines. For decades, Southwest resisted Microsoft's urgings that it upgrade its systems to the latest versions of Windows, relying on Windows 3.1, which is 32 years old \u2014 so antique that the CrowdStrike update wouldn't even work on the airline's systems.\n\nSo while affected carriers such as Delta, United and American had canceled nearly 2,400 flights by 6 p.m. Friday, Southwest had canceled three. (By midday Monday, the number of canceled flights reached beyond 12,300.) That doesn't mean that Southwest gets everything right. After all, the airline suffered more than its competitors from the ferocious storm in December 2022 that snarled air traffic nationwide \u2014 precisely because it had not paid enough attention to keeping its computer systems updated.\n\nIn this case, however, Southwest's cheapskate culture was its savior. That may only put it on the same level as the proverbial blind squirrel that occasionally finds a nut. But it shows that all of our Big Business squirrels need to keep their eyes open, and focused on the perils of inattention.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 50% of His $46 Billion Trust Invested in 2 Brilliant Stocks",
        "content": "The Bill and Melinda Gates (BMG) Foundation is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world. As of December 2023, it had issued grants totaling nearly $78 billion to help alleviate poverty, improve health, support education, and combat inequities around the world.\n\nThat charitable giving is funded by the BMG Foundation Trust, which manages money donated by Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett. Investors should keep the trust on their radar because it returned 47% during the three-year period that ended in March 2024, while the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned just 32%.\n\nThe BMG Foundation Trust had 50% of its $46 billion portfolio spread across two stocks as of March: 34% in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and 16% in Waste Management(NYSE: WM). Those have been brilliant investments, almost doubling the gains in the S&P 500 over the last three years. And Bill Gates clearly has confidence in their future.\n\nMicrosoft: 34% asset allocation\n\nMicrosoft is the largest software vendor and second-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) provider. The company accounted for 16.8% of cloud spending in 2023 when infrastructure, platform, and software services are considered collectively, up from 16.5% in 2022. The next closest competitor was Amazon Web Services, with 12.4% market share, according to research from IDC.\n\nMicrosoft's dominance in software comes from its business-productivity and enterprise resource-planning platforms Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, respectively. The company has created new monetization opportunities in both ecosystems with generative artificial intelligence (AI) copilots. The IDC recently recognized Microsoft as a leader in conversational AI software.\n\nMicrosoft Azure's strength in CIPS comes from its data base, cybersecurity, and hybrid cloud products, as well as AI and machine learning services. A recent survey from Morgan Stanley identified Azure as the CIPS provider most likely to gain market share in the coming years. \"The company's leadership in the shift to the public cloud is now being compounded by an early leadership positioning in generative AI,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note.\n\nMicrosoft reported good financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024). Revenue rose 17% to $61.9 billion, and earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped 20% to $2.94 per diluted share. Those strong numbers were driven by momentum in enterprise software and cloud services, fueled in part by demand for AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street currently expects the company to grow earnings by 14% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 38.3 times earnings look fairly expensive, but not absurdly so. Investors eager to own Microsoft stock can start with a small position today, but they should aim to make future purchases at less expensive valuations.\n\nWaste Management: 16% asset allocation\n\nWaste Management is the largest provider of waste collection and disposal services in North America as measured by revenue. The company controls 28% of U.S. landfill volume, while its closest competitor controls 20%.\n\nBrian Bernard at Morningstar says its vast network of transfer stations and landfills has historically supported pricing power, and he believes that this economic moat is \"nearly impossible to replicate given immense regulatory hurdles.\"\n\nMore broadly, investors should appreciate Waste Management because it provides essential services, meaning demand should persist to some degree through economic ups and downs. That defensive quality has made it more resilient than the average S&P 500 company during stock market downturns.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, Waste Management has outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 10 percentage points during bear markets since 2000.\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Waste Management Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (33%) October 2007 (57%) (43%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (17%) Average (41%) (31%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nWaste Management reported mixed results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 5.5% to $5.2 billion, falling short of the 6.7% sales growth Wall Street anticipated. But GAAP earnings still jumped 35% to $1.75 per diluted share, easily beating the 15% growth forecast by analysts.\n\nThe waste management sector is expected to grow at 5.4% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Wall Street expects Waste Management to grow earnings per share by 12% annually over the next three to five years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 36.5 times earnings look rather expensive, especially when the three-year average is 33 times earnings. Personally, I would avoid this stock until it trades at a discount to its average price-to-earnings multiple over the last three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "The technology sector has helped lead the market higher not only this year but really for the past decade. This can be seen in the performance of an index such as the Dow Jones Technology Index, which is up over 27% year to date and has generated an average annual return of 20% over the past 10 years.\n\nAs such, the tech sector is certainly not only for traders, but also for long-term buy and hold investors. Let's look at two tech stocks that investors can buy and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nOnce considered to be a stodgy, old-fashioned tech company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has repositioned itself to become one of the top tech companies leading the charge in artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, the company's ability to be able to reinvent itself over the years is one reason why it is a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nMicrosoft's first big move showing its ability to adapt to the times was shifting from a one-time purchase model to a subscription model, with the introduction of Microsoft 365 starting back in 2013. The gradual nature with which the company did this proved to be a strong growth driver while not alienating its customer base.\n\nMore recently, Microsoft has shown itself to be at the forefront of AI, making an early investment in OpenAI and then later substantially increasing that investment and partnering with the company to incorporate its technology throughout its various product offers. Thus far, the company's Azure cloud computing segment has been a big beneficiary of this early move, as customers clamored to build out their AI applications with the help of Azure. Given Azure's consumption-based model, where customers pay for what they need, this has led to strong growth for Azure and the business taking share from competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has also shown a willingness to take big swings with acquisitions over the years, including with LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard. GitHub has been a strong performer for for the company, and it too has been a nice beneficiary of AI, with the introduction of GitHub AI assistant copilots to the developer platform helping drive 45% growth for the platform in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile not currently on many investors' radars when looking at Microsoft, it will be interesting to see what the company does with AI when it comes to Xbox and Activision Blizzard when it releases its next video gaming console in a few years. There could be a lot of growth in store in a few years, given the potential advancement AI will have in gaming.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.9 times, the stock looks attractively priced, given its long-term growth potential and its monopoly-like dominance in the worker productivity (Word, Excel, etc.) and PC operating system (Windows) spaces.\n\nStory continues MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a monopoly-like dominant market position, but instead of worker productivity tools, it is winning with Google search, which has an estimated over 90% global market share. Like Microsoft, Alphabet's cloud computing segment is nicely benefiting from the AI boom.\n\nThe similarities with Microsoft don't end there, as Alphabet has also made shrewd acquisitions. The best example of this is the company buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. YouTube generated $8.1 billion in revenue just in the first quarter of 2024, so it's pretty safe to say it was a great acquisition.\n\nAlphabet is currently rumored to be close to acquiring Israeli cybersecurity company Wiz for around $23 billion. If consummated, the deal is expected to give Alphabet a needed security piece to help it win more cloud computing and AI deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's core search business has a lot of potential to profit from AI. The company is already experimenting with AI overlays to answer some search-related questions, as well as with ways to monetize this new feature. While it has run into some early AI hiccups, AI overlays still open up a potential avenue to serve ads to the large percentage of search results where it does not provide them. Traditionally, the company only serves ad results to about 20% of its search queries and is only paid when these links are clicked.\n\nTrading at 23.5 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio of less than 0.8 times, Alphabet's stock is cheap. Given the potential growth in front of it and its dominant market position in search, the stock looks like a great technology stock to buy and hold for the long term.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Microsoft (MSFT) standing at $442.94, reflecting a +1.33% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.58%.\n\nShares of the software maker have depreciated by 2.82% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.77% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Microsoft in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 30, 2024. On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $2.90 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 7.81%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $64.16 billion, showing a 14.19% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

        "content": "The graduating class of 2024 from GBSB Global Business School in Spain, including bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and MBA graduates. Courtesy photo\n\nEver since a group of businessmen and educators founded GBSB Global Business School in 2011, it has, by necessity, been agile and adaptive.\n\nIt is headquartered in Spain, a country with more than 80 business schools including some that are ranked among the best in Europe and the world. It has adopted an ethos of constant change to set itself apart, focusing on technologies and models that will shape business of the future.\n\nGBSB continues to evolve. This fall, it will enroll the first cohort of its accredited PhD program and has a redesigned MBA meant to stay current with advanced business trends like AI and sustainability. The school also has a brand new dean and executive president, Wiktor Patena.\n\n\u201cWe are unique in the sense that we are a very digitally-oriented school. Whether it\u2019s a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s program, we always include several courses related to the digital area,\u201d Patena tells Poets&Quants.\n\n\u201cI also believe this school offers value for money. We provide good quality education with a focus on digital areas, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Our programs are highly ranked and accredited, and are reasonably priced. This value for money is what distinguishes us from other similar business schools.\u201d\n\nP&Q INTERVIEW WITH WIKTOR PATENA\n\nToday, GBSB Global offers a full portfolio of undergraduate, graduate, and executive programs all built around an integrated digital ecosystem that connects students in and out of the classroom. In 2017, it became the first business school in Spain to become a Microsoft Showcase School, used as a model for schools that are engaged in the digital transformation in terms of both teaching and learning.\n\nGBSB Global dean Wiktor Patena\n\nIts three-year Bachelor of Business Administration and Digital Innovation has a modular design which allows students to focus their education while still getting the general business degree. The degree offers concentrations ranging from digital entrepreneurship to finance and fintech to sports and E-sports management.\n\nIt offers a 10-month MBA as well as 12 different specialized master\u2019s ranging from Fashion & Luxury to Entrepreneurship to Business Innovation. It also offers a Masters in Management and Master of Science in Management with various fields of concentration.\n\nGBSB Global has campuses in Barcelona, Madrid, and a new campus on the island of Malta which opened in 2021. It also refers to its online offerings as its fourth campus, and most of the degree programs it offers can be taken either on campus or fully online.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatena brings with him both international and accrediting experience, leading his last business school through the grueling, years-long process of AACSB accreditation \u2013 the gold standard in business education. He also brings a long-term vision for GBSB Global that looks to strengthen its position both locally and internationally. This includes embarking on its own AACSB accreditation within the next several years and possibly opening a campus in the Middle East.\n\nPoets&Quants caught up with Patena to talk more about his vision for GBSB Global. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s start with your professional background and your journey to GBSB Global.\n\nI joined GBSB Global in January this year, and I\u2019m still settling down. Prior to this, I was working for HCT (Higher Colleges of Technology) in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the largest educational institution in the United Arab Emirates. I was managing the business school, which was also the largest division within HCT, with about 8,000 students. I started as the director of the MBA program, then became the associate dean, and eventually the Executive Dean. It was an interesting time.\n\nBefore that, I was the Provost at a Polish business school (Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu), affiliated with National Louis University from Chicago. We were treated like a branch of NLU Chicago, offering double degrees to students. This was one of the first private business schools in Poland.\n\nI would mention two breakthrough moments in my career. As an academic, I realized at some point that I wanted to practice what I preach. I am a finance guy, basically, specializing in company valuation, so together with my mentor, I decided to open a consulting company focused on company valuations. This change allowed me to look at things from a different perspective. When I talk to my students, I have many real-life cases to share because of my consulting experience. This has helped me a lot in my career. I\u2019m glad I can say I practice what I preach, and I think this resonates with our GBSB Global faculty, many of whom are adjuncts and practitioners, just like I was for a couple of years.\n\nLEGO Serious Play\u00a0 is part of the GBSB Global Business School toolkit, where it is integrated into a series of workshops offered within the course curriculum. These workshops cover various topics ranging from Design Thinking to Agile Methodologies, aiming to encourage creative thinking, innovative approaches, and sharpen problem-solving skills among students. Courtesy photo\n\nAnd the other breakthrough moment?\n\nWhile I was in Poland, I took advantage of Poland joining the European Union by participating in the fantastic Erasmus Exchange Programme which allows faculty to travel to different countries for short lectures, typically lasting a week. I traveled to various countries in Europe through this system.\n\nThen, of course, Dubai was another unique experience in terms of travel. Now, being in Malta is different still.\n\nI like the quote by Mark Twain: \u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice.\u201d It\u2019s really true. From my perspective, it\u2019s wonderful to travel to many different countries, meet people, and experience different cultures. There are always some differences, but they aren\u2019t barriers. People are just different. If you have an open mind, you can easily adapt to new environments and be successful.\n\nWhy did the deanship at GBSB Global interest you?\n\nWell, to be honest, I was about to retire. The highlight of my career at HCT in Dubai was getting them accredited with AACSB. This happened in the year I left, and it was a huge event. As you probably know, it\u2019s quite a journey. It took about five years to start and complete the process. I was really a bit tired after that and thought it might be time to return to Europe.\n\nThen, GBSB Global approached me because they had some AACSB aspirations. They were looking for someone who could help them go through this journey successfully. Given my experience, I thought it might not be such a bad idea. I still feel very active, so I decided it was an interesting project to take on, closer to home. I hope to leverage the networking and contacts I have to help GBSB Global achieve this goal.\n\nSo, you went from a five year experience that made you want to retire, and you\u2019re jumping back into the same kind of experience at a new school. That\u2019s interesting. Has that accreditation process started at GBSB Global yet?\n\nNot immediately. When I joined GBSB Global, we were dealing with ACBSP accreditation, which is a different organization, somewhat second rank but similar. We had to complete this process first, which we did successfully some months ago. Now, we have another project, which is local accreditation. As you know, we have three locations: Malta, Barcelona, and Madrid. Barcelona, in particular, because Catalonia feels somewhat separate from Spain, they have some special requirements.\n\nBut then, we have already discussed with top management that once this is done, we will revisit the idea of pursuing AACSB accreditation. In fact, I spoke with the head of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at AACSB just yesterday about moving forward with this project.\n\nGBSB Global regularly invites guest speakers and visiting professors with practical knowledge in different business segments who share first-hand knowledge through case studies and real business examples. Here, Pilar Barrio, Digital Transformation and CX expert and an entrepreneur, speaks to the Digital Business cohort. Courtesy photo\n\nFor our readers who are not familiar, what do you believe sets GBSB Global apart from its competitors?\n\nWell, this is actually a question I asked myself when I joined because each place is different and unique. After a couple of months, I realized that we are unique in the sense that we are a very digitally-oriented school. Whether it\u2019s a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s program, we always include several courses related to the digital area. For example, we offer courses on how to start a digital business and on disruptive technologies. These courses are ubiquitous across the different programs we offer.\n\nAdditionally, we are very focused on innovation and entrepreneurship. One of our flagship projects is called G-Accelerator, which is like a business incubator but more. It\u2019s a pre-incubation mentorship program that prepares individuals with new venture or startup ideas for the next incubation phase. Every year, we receive over 200 applications, and the applicants are shortlisted to go through the program. This has been very successful.\n\nFinally, I believe this school offers value for money. We provide good quality education with a focus on digital areas, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Our programs are highly ranked and accredited, and are reasonably priced. This value for money is what distinguishes us from other similar business schools.\n\nBeyond the accreditation journey, what are some of your big goals for your first tenure? What is your vision for GBSB Global?\n\nAs you said, accreditation is one of the goals. We plan to continue with ACBSP and then start the journey with AACSB, hoping to get accredited within five to six years because that\u2019s what it typically takes.\n\nQuite recently, our PhD program was accredited, so now we offer all three academic levels: bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and PhD. We are launching the first PhD cohort this fall, which is an exciting moment for us.\n\nHow many PhDs are starting the program?\n\nNot that many in the first batch, because we only got accredited in April or March, so we didn\u2019t have much time to advertise. It\u2019s going to be a group of about seven or eight people in the PhD program. The program is very demanding, and it\u2019s not designed for profit\u2014the tuition fees are at a break-even level. But it matters to us for different reasons beyond just tuition fees.\n\nWe are still focusing heavily on our MBA program, with a newly redesigned version being offered in Madrid for the first time.\n\nFinally, although it\u2019s more of a long-term plan, we are thinking of growing internationally. Apart from our campuses in Malta, Barcelona, and Madrid, we may consider expanding to Dubai one day. My experience there could be helpful.\n\nYou mentioned the launch of your revamped MBA. What is new about it, and what do you believe makes it special?\n\nLast year, the MBA was redesigned because the previous one was a typical MBA. By nature, MBAs are offered to people from different walks of life who, for instance, got promoted to a managerial position and suddenly need to know a bit about finance, accounting, marketing, etc. So the previous program was traditional in that sense.\n\nThe new MBA still includes all these major components because that\u2019s what MBAs are for\u2014like, say, for a doctor who suddenly became the director of a hospital. They still need this basic knowledge about different functionalities of the business. However, we added a couple of tracks to keep track of current changes in the business world.\n\nFor example, we have three new courses: one called Artificial Intelligence in the Future, another on Sustainability and Governance, and one more on Consumer Experience in the Digital Environment. This is our attempt to stay current with what\u2019s happening in the business world.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a project management class that functions more like a consulting project done in conjunction with industry partners. This allows students to work directly with companies on real-world projects.\n\nNEXT PAGE:What sets the GBSB Global MBA apart? + Plans for executive education and undergrad programs\n\nA course at GBSB Global.\n\nWhat do you think makes your MBA stand apart from other European MBAs?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s very different from others, but we offer our MBA in different formats. Some MBAs are offered face-to-face, while others are available online. While we don\u2019t yet have rankings for the new format, the previous one was highly ranked by various organizations.\n\nFor example, the full-time MBA was ranked by QS in 2023 as one of the top 60 in Europe. The online MBA was also highly ranked in 2024, placing in the top 30 in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and in the top 100 in the world. These high rankings are quite impressive and are a testament to the quality of our programs, even though I cannot take credit.\n\nSo, I believe our high rankings and the flexibility in formats are what distinguish us in terms of our MBA offerings.\n\nAnything in the undergrad or executive space that has you excited? Any planned innovations or updates?\n\nQuite recently, we looked more closely at executive education projects. Since I\u2019m now residing in Malta, we decided to start here. Just recently, we joined the Malta Chamber of Commerce to build a network of important companies operating in this region and beyond, aiming to offer executive education programs.\n\nWe prepared two kinds of offerings. One is open courses, which are part of our curriculum for different programs anyway, but we believe they might be useful for people outside the school as well. The other is custom-made programs that we can prepare for companies once we establish some connections. This is in process, but we hope it will be successful. I\u2019ve already had talks with a few different companies and met members of the Chamber of Commerce, and I\u2019m looking forward to cooperating with them closely.\n\nGBSB Global dean Wiktor Patena\n\nAre those kinds of executive partnerships new to GBSB Global?\n\nIt\u2019s not new, as we have had a few significant projects in the past, but it was never done consistently. For example, we had a project in Russia a few years ago involving high-speed trains. A group of engineers was brought here to study European examples of high-speed trains, and it was very successful. We also had a project for a company in Qatar, where participants came to enjoy Barcelona and work on a project as part of our executive education program.\n\nSo, while there is a history of successful projects, the goal now is to do it more consistently. We aim to have ongoing projects with these companies, starting in Malta and then offering similar programs in Barcelona and Madrid.\n\nAnd what about in the undergrad space?\n\nOur undergraduate programs are fundamental to what we offer. While 80% of our students are in master\u2019s programs, about 9% are bachelor students.\n\nWhat\u2019s exciting about our undergraduate programs is our focus on applied education and learning by doing. We offer internships, which are not mandatory, but we have specialized units dedicated to arranging internships for students who want to participate. About 20% of our students take internships with companies we arranged for them. This is crucial because staying in touch with the industry is essential.\n\nAnother aspect is our mandatory business simulation games. For students who don\u2019t have the chance to take internships, these simulations are required. I think that\u2019s really important.\n\nAdditionally, as I previously mentioned, we have the G-Accelerator program for students with entrepreneurial ideas. They can apply for this mentorship program and hopefully be shortlisted. I sit on the jury, so I see the exciting ideas students come up with.\n\nFrom my own experience, having run my own business, I always tell my students that being your own boss is incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s an exciting journey where you manage everything.\n\nIs there room to grow in the Bachelor space if it\u2019s only 9% of your students?\n\nOf course, bachelor programs are important to us because they offer a three-year commitment. This allows us to watch students grow and develop over a longer period. So yes, we are actively trying to attract students from all over the world to our bachelor programs.\n\nWe are very international. Historically, we have had students from 150 different countries. It\u2019s exciting for each student to be in a class with peers from 10 to 12 different countries. This diversity naturally teaches them about cultural differences, which is invaluable.\n\nWe are proud of our diverse student body, which recently includes many students from South America, Africa, India, Europe, and the USA. It\u2019s a great feeling to have such a diverse student body.\n\nFor a U.S. business student who is interested in studying abroad, what is the value proposition for GBSB Global?\n\nI know that the U.S. has a great education system. I\u2019m proud of it myself because my daughter graduated from Caltech. But Europe also has a lot to offer. We are located in very attractive locations. For many of our students, just coming to Barcelona, for example, is a great reason to join us. Our school is in the heart of the city, just a 10-minute walk from the famous Las Ramblas Street and other landmarks. Similarly, Malta is an attractive place to study, whether it\u2019s for one semester, two semesters, or even three years.\n\nAnother key point is value for money. Studying at our business school doesn\u2019t cost $30,000 a year, which is a significant consideration for American students. Our programs are well-ranked and accredited by government and professional agencies, offering good quality education at an affordable price. GBSB Global Business School has campuses in Barcelona, Madrid, and Malta in Spain.\n\nWhat are some trends in business education that you\u2019re watching or really excited about?\n\nOf course, I\u2019m watching the trends. I still follow what happens at AACSB because they have access to a huge amount of data. Every school that is a member of AACSB has to send reports every year, contributing to this vast data pool. Recently, I was reviewing their reports, and they identified three trends that I agree with:\n\nFirst, technology integration is crucial. We were one of the first schools showcased by Microsoft as a Microsoft Showcase School. All our communication is done via Microsoft Teams, and we utilize various functionalities like charts and business intelligence dashboard. We use new technologies like Nearpod and Kahoot! and have an excellent virtual learning environment to support our students, especially those studying online. Staying current in this area is important.\n\nSecond, flexible learning environments are key. This means offering programs in different formats: blended, face-to-face, and online. The new generation is used to online delivery, so we offer that as well.\n\nFinally, collaboration with the industry is vital. As I mentioned, we offer internships and the G-Accelerator program. Additionally, we use a lot of adjunct faculty who work in the industry and bring their practical experience to the classroom. The majority of our faculty are part-time adjuncts, which can be seen as a weakness, but is also a strength because students appreciate learning from professionals who practice what they preach and can convey hands-on experience.\n\nWhat are some challenges and opportunities you see for GBSB Global?\n\nLet me start with the challenges. We are in a very competitive market, especially in Barcelona. It\u2019s such an attractive place that it draws many students, but also many business schools, including foreign ones, trying to offer their programs here. We have to compete and differentiate ourselves, which is always a challenge. So far, we have been successful and are growing, but the competition never ends, making it an ongoing challenge.\n\nAs for new opportunities, I mentioned some new locations. We are trying to grow geographically. Currently, we are in three locations, and I think moving to one more location would be a great step to become even bigger. Additionally, we are putting more emphasis on our sales team to attract students from all over the world to come to Barcelona, Malta, and Madrid and start their studies with us.\n\nAnything else you\u2019d like to add?\n\nAs I said, we are in a very competitive business, always looking for new ways to be successful and different from others.\n\nI think we are unique in that we offer education in different locations. This is a bit difficult to manage. For example, I\u2019m currently located in Malta, but I frequently travel to Barcelona and Madrid to manage these three places. We also have a very diverse student population and a diverse faculty, mostly adjuncts and part-time staff.\n\nThese factors make us unique but also more challenging to manage. But, it\u2019s exciting to build a school that is different, dealing with diversity, and incorporating innovation and entrepreneurship into the curricula. We try to follow the latest trends in education, which makes this journey exciting. Every day is different, and you can never take anything for granted as you might in more well-established schools. That makes me eager to wake up in the morning, wondering how exciting the next day will be.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: MBA RANKING: BUSINESS SCHOOL CAREERS, CULTURE AND CURRICULUM AND MINORITIES AT THE TOP U.S. MBA PROGRAMS: AFTER 2 YEARS OF DECLINES, WHAT NEXT?\n\nThe post The P&Q Interview: New Dean Of GBSB Global On Preparing Students For The Digital Future appeared first on Poets&Quants.",

        "title": "Google parent Alphabet to report Q2 earnings Tuesday with AI, ad spending front and center",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, giving Wall Street a closer look at the state of the digital advertising market and whether generative AI hype is translating to revenue growth. The tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\n\nIn an investor note, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he expects advertising spending to be similar to or better than Q1, with Google paid search growth in the mid-teens.\n\n\u201cFundamentals remain healthy, with solid ad spend, potential benefits from Olympics and elections,\u201d Thill wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt struck a similarly upbeat tone in his investor note. \u201cWe think the setup remains positive heading into 2Q results with our ad survey and agency commentary pointing to continued strength for Google Search,\u201d he wrote. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai speaks during the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference on May 14 in Mountain View, Calif. (Photo by GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\nOn the cloud front, Wall Street is anticipating Google Cloud revenue of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million. That would mark an increase from the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle still trails both Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud space, with its rivals capturing the number one and two spots, respectively. However, the segment continues to grow, and Alphabet is banking on its investments in generative AI to help power stronger revenue and customer acquisition in the future.\n\nBut when exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google\u2019s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,\u201d Thill wrote.\n\nAs for Google\u2019s search business, Devitt says AI search overviews could create \u201cincremental engagement and may become a tailwind for Search monetization over time.\u201d\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren\u2019t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nWhile generative AI is sure to be a major theme this earnings season, it\u2019s still unclear how much it will boost companies' bottom lines. But with Google the first among Big Tech companies to report earnings, it should give us some indication of whether the technology is generating meaningful revenue or not.

        "title": "How the West became dangerously dependent on Microsoft",
        "content": "Travel disruption is expected to carry on this week after Friday's IT meltdown threw airline schedules into disarray - Bav Media\n\nMicrosoft was not directly to blame for the computer bug that caused last weekend\u2019s IT meltdown, but it did not take long for the software giant to become the face of the incident.\n\nHuge screens at airports, hospitals and train terminals all flashed up with the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, the trademark error screen that displays when Windows computers fail to load correctly.\n\nNews bulletins carried reports of a worldwide \u201cMicrosoft outage\u201d delaying flights and breaking cash machines, while staff at the company\u2019s Seattle headquarters rushed to issue guidance on fixing the issue.\n\nMicrosoft, the world\u2019s second most valuable company with a market value of more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.3 trillion), was quick to point at the root cause of the fiasco: the Texas security firm CrowdStrike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrowdStrike had issued an update containing faulty code to its Falcon cyber defence software that rendered Windows PCs and servers using it inoperable. \u201cThis was not a Microsoft incident,\u201d Microsoft wrote in an online post at the weekend.\n\nThe company said CrowdStrike\u2019s update had affected just 8.5m Windows machines, less than 1pc of the global total.\n\nHowever, the bug disproportionately affected Windows computers, and Microsoft\u2019s ubiquity among businesses and critical infrastructure providers meant the outage was more widespread than it might have been.\n\nThe company is the dominant IT provider to much of the public and private sector, both across PCs and the backend servers on which databases and systems run. Digital boards in Times Square, New York, were taken offline as a result of the widespread outage - Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe outage came at a time of increased scrutiny on the West\u2019s dependence on Microsoft for the computer systems that underpin daily life from payments to airline bookings and doctors\u2019 appointments.\n\n\u201cThe reason the outage was so widespread is due to how ubiquitous the Windows operating system is across various industries. Airlines use it for check-in desks, retail use it for point-of-sales machines, and more,\u201d says Jamil Ahmed of IT consultancy Solace.\n\nCyber officials have raised concerns in recent months about dependence on Microsoft, which has faced questions about its own cyber credentials.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company faced criticism over a cyber attack in 2020 that allowed Russian state-sponsored hackers to exploit a flaw in software from another company, SolarWinds, and gain access to thousands of corporate networks, including that of the US government. While Microsoft was also a victim, critics said it had been aware of the flaw before the hack and failed to raise the alarm.\n\nIn the last year, hackers linked to Russia and China have, in separate incidents, managed to bypass Microsoft\u2019s defences to gain access to thousands of US government emails. In the Chinese hack last summer, emails were stolen from Gina Raimondo,\u00a0the US commerce secretary, and Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China.\n\nA flaw in the company\u2019s Exchange server system was also used by Chinese hackers who obtained data from the Electoral Commission last year, security researchers claimed.\n\nPressure on the company culminated in April when an official US report into the Chinese email theft accused the company of a \u201ccascade of security failures\u201d and \u201cavoidable errors\u201d and said that its security culture \u201crequires an overhaul\u201d.\n\nSoon after, AJ Grotto, a former White House cyber policy director, claimed Microsoft\u2019s status as the US government\u2019s IT provider amounted to a national security issue, and said the company should be treated as such.\n\n\u2018Fragile systems\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Lina Khan, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission, tweeted: \u201cThese incidents reveal how concentration can create fragile systems.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft itself has pledged to do better. It has tied bosses\u2019 bonuses to their efforts to promote cybersecurity and promised to make security the company\u2019s top priority.\n\nBut while last Friday\u2019s global IT outage was caused by a CrowdStrike bug, Microsoft faced questions about how the company\u2019s software was able to cause such havoc on Windows machines. CrowdStrike Falcon is installed at the kernel, the highest level of system access, which means that when something goes wrong, it is not isolated to the software itself, but can make the whole computer unusable.\n\nApple machines, by contrast, do not allow security software to run at the kernel level, preventing similar cases. While this could be seen as a security flaw in Microsoft machines, the company said it was required to allow third-party software high-level access due to a settlement with EU competition authorities in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt turns out Windows is configured in such a way that a piece of one piece of buggy code can topple the whole thing, partly because of that EU decision. There\u2019s nothing you could realistically expect Microsoft to have done about it,\u201d says one former cyber official. \u201cBut it is a reminder of that sheer dependence.\u201d\n\nThat EU settlement came in response to concerns that Microsoft had become too dominant in the commercial sector, squeezing out rival providers of antivirus and browser software. Now, the concerns are that too much critical infrastructure relies on it.\n\n\u201cThis event certainly brings public attention to the problem of monoculture,\u201d Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, says.\n\n\u201cWhen a specific software gains significant market and user share, it becomes important, and a potential risk point. In this case, since CrowdStrike software was so popular, and since Windows is extremely widespread, it leads to clearly visible IT chaos, and an availability breach.\u201d\n\nLast weekend\u2019s IT fiasco did not affect everywhere equally. Russian state media boasted of the country being largely shielded from the outages, since sanctions mean it has developed its own homegrown alternatives to Microsoft and CrowdStrike. The impact in China was also less severe, although this was largely due to CrowdStrike being a rarity in the country.\n\nBut for hackers lurking in the two countries, Friday\u2019s chaos will not have gone unnoticed. The outage demonstrated how a single point of failure can bring parts of Western economies to a standstill. Microsoft may not have caused the outage, but our dependence on it means it is a target for those seeking to start the next one.",

        "content": "CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock continued its downward price trajectory Monday as its cloud software update on Thursday triggered an outage that affected businesses worldwide.\n\nA failed update to CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform disrupted Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) systems, halting critical global services, including airports, ports, financial institutions, and hospitals.\n\nMicrosoft said the outage affected less than 1% of Windows users globally, equating to 8.5 million machines.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Analyst Stays Course On CrowdStrike Despite Outage, Expects Strong Company Reputation To Aid Recovery\n\nWindows holds about 72% of the global operating system market share, while CrowdStrike commands nearly 24% in endpoint protection security.\n\nMicrosoft clarified that a prior agreement with the European Commission prevents it from adopting the same security measures as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it battled criticism.\n\nSeveral analysts rerated Crowdstrike stock on Monday, voicing their mixed opinions on the prospects of the stock.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John Difucci downgraded CrowdStrike from Buy to Neutral. BTIG analyst Gray Powell downgraded from Buy to Neutral.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens maintained a Neutral and lowered the price target from\u00a0$400\u00a0to\u00a0$310.\n\nOwens notes the CrowdStrike incident as relatively unprecedented. With the incident impacting airlines, hospitals, and 911 call centers, the analyst expects that speculation around litigation will remain for some time, alongside uncertainty around pricing, renewals, and new logo additions. The analyst projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $961.2 million and $0.99.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated an Outperform. Kidron removed CrowdStrike from his 2024 top picks. While the analyst remains positive about the long-term opportunity, he expects shares to face continued pressure near-term.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane reiterated a Buy and a $405\u00a0price target.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an Outperform rating and a price target of $420, down from $380.\u00a0\u00a0Hedberg expects CrowdStrike to emerge as a stronger cyber-security vendor as this was not a breach but rather a significant breakdown in process.\n\nThe analyst considers the outage a possible near-term overhang, which illustrates the interconnected nature of the ecosystem. Hedberg projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $959.8 million and $0.99.\n\nTruist Securities analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr reiterated a Buy with a price target of $400. Fishbein Jr. notes that the outage and impact are a result of a faulty software update rather than a security breach.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst expects the outage to be okay with the fundamental demand for the company\u2019s security solutions. In the near term, it does dent the company\u2019s stellar image, but Fishbein Jr. did not expect its competitors to take market share from CrowdStrike. He remains a buyer on weakness.\n\nScotia Bank analyst Patrick Colville downgraded to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a price target of $300, down from the prior $393.\n\nColville voiced a similar opinion as per Trusit analyst Fishbein Jr. Colville projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $953.8 million and $0.99.\n\nThe stock plunged 30% in the last five days.\n\nPrice Action: CRWD shares traded lower by 12.8% at $265.74 at the last check on Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Down on Faulty Update: Should You Buy It Now?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD shares faced a dramatic 11% plunge last Friday, a direct consequence of a faulty update to the company\u2019s cloud-based cybersecurity platform, Falcon.\n\nThe mistake in the Falcon update led to a global IT outage, impacting banks, airports, hospitals, retailers, various businesses and government agencies. This causes significant disruption and economic losses worldwide.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about CrowdStrike\u2019s reliability and long-term prospects, leading to a debate on whether this dip presents a buying opportunity or a signal to stay away.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nWhat Caused the Global IT Outage?\n\nThe chaos was triggered by a defect in a single content update for Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT Windows hosts within CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. The update caused system malfunctions for about 8.5 million or less than 1% of the total Windows devices, leading to severe disruptions for clients globally.\n\nInitially, Microsoft was suspected to be at fault since the outage only affected Windows systems. However, Microsoft clarified that it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve the problem. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz acknowledged the issue, too, and confirmed that a fix had been deployed.\n\nThis incident has highlighted significant vulnerabilities within CrowdStrike's operational processes, casting a shadow over its reputation. While the company's swift acknowledgment and rectification efforts were commendable, the scale of the impact has left a lasting impression on clients and investors alike.\n\nWhy Did an Update Error Cause So Much Chaos?\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform is designed as a cloud-native endpoint security solution, eliminating the need for on-site hardware. This model offers several advantages, including ease of installation, scalability and simplified updates. Falcon\u2019s architecture allows CrowdStrike to secure clients with recurring subscriptions and expand its service offerings through additional cloud-based modules.\n\nThese strengths have been boosting CrowdStrike\u2019s overall financial performance and have established it as one of the leading endpoint security solution providers. The company\u2019s revenues have grown at a CAGR of approximately 52% over the past three fiscal years, from $874 million in fiscal 2021 to $3.06 billion in fiscal 2024. Similarly, its non-GAAP EPS increased more than elevenfold, from 27 cents in fiscal 2021 to $3.09 per share.\n\nThe incident has exposed the risks inherent in cloud-native platforms. While they offer numerous benefits, a single point of failure can have catastrophic consequences. The outage has raised concerns about the robustness of CrowdStrike's quality control and internal testing procedures, suggesting a need for more stringent safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Share Loss and Competitor Advantage\n\nThe recent outage has not only damaged CrowdStrike's reputation but also opened the door for competitors to gain market share. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW and Fortinet, Inc. FTNT, among others, stand to benefit from any loss of confidence in CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity market is fiercely competitive, and clients dissatisfied with CrowdStrike's recent performance may consider alternative solutions.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, with its diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services, could attract clients seeking more reliable cybersecurity solutions. Fortinet\u2019s rich experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions might attract customers who are looking to switch to another platform following the aftermath of CrowdStrike\u2019s IT outage.\n\nMicrosoft, which has been steadily expanding its cloud-based cybersecurity offerings, may also see increased interest as organizations reassess their cybersecurity strategies. The high-profile nature of CrowdStrike's failure has amplified the visibility of its competitors, potentially accelerating their market share gains.\n\nLofty Valuations\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s lofty valuation raises concerns over the stock\u2019s upside potential. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. Currently, CrowdStrike's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are significantly above the industry average.\n\nCRWD stock is currently trading at 69.41X forward 12-month earnings compared with 32.33X for the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry. Similarly, it trades at 16.56X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.47X.\n\nThese elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGiven the recent events, investors should exercise caution with CrowdStrike stock. The faulty Falcon update has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the company's operations, raising questions about its ability to maintain client trust and market dominance. The incident's impact on CrowdStrike's long-term growth prospects cannot be underestimated, and the company may face increased scrutiny and pressure to improve its quality control measures. Moreover, CrowdStrike's high valuation multiples add another layer of risk.\n\nIn light of the recent outage and the competitive landscape, it is prudent for investors to stay away from CrowdStrike for now. The combination of operational risks and high valuation makes this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock a risky proposition.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What to Expect\n\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\n\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\n\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\n\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\n\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\n\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\n\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\n\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\n\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\n\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week's Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Where Will Intel Be in 7 Years?",
        "content": "Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been the rare semiconductor stock that has faltered this year. In fact, as of Friday, Intel was down 34% for 2024, even as the one of the largest semiconductor sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was up 42%. And the trend over the past five years has been even worse, with Intel's underperformance compounding to ghastly levels: INTC Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) Chart\n\nHowever, the company has recently issued positive updates on CEO Pat Gelsinger's ambitious turnaround plan, which began in 2021 and should reach the end of its first stage by next year. In recent months, Intel also issued a long-term financial model that goes out to 2030.\n\nIf management keeps executing and hits its 2030 goals, that would make the stock very, very cheap at current levels.\n\nFive nodes in four years, while building a foundry\n\nIntel's ambitious turnaround has two main-components: becoming the technology leader again for its own products, and opening up its internal fab to external customers to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). But both of these goals center on the same premise: regaining manufacturing leadership for leading-edge nodes.\n\nThat requires a lot of investment and success in chip design. Another obstacle making things more difficult: Intel's main cash-cow businesses in PC CPUs and traditional server CPUs have been depressed for the past couple of years following the pandemic.\n\nBut for the things it can control, Intel has impressed. The company qualified to receive helping funds from the U.S. government via the CHIPS Act passed in late 2022, and lured in co-investments from big-name investors Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation and private equity firm Apollo Global. Additionally, Intel has even gotten some customers to pre-pay for its upcoming 18A node, which will be in production later this year.\n\n18A is important, as the fifth node of the four-year plan, when management believes it will match TSMC's capabilities. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently became the most prominent company to announce it would become a customer of 18A, announcing that in February.\n\nMeanwhile, technology execution has been good. In June, Intel announced it had gotten its Intel 3 node, introduced late last year and the third node of the five-node plan, into mass production on schedule. Intel 3 is a 3nm node, equivalent to what TSMC first produced last year. But Intel's 20A and 18A nodes are following close behind, set for their first production later this year and mass production next year.\n\nIntel's 2030 model\n\nThis year, Intel began separating out the internal foundry from its \"Intel Products\" division, or its in-house designed chips, calculating Products margins as if the Products segment were a third-party fabless company. As you can see, that business has a relatively high 24% operating margin, even though Intel's chips are currently on lagging-edge technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the internal Foundry segment, when separated, shows a massive $7.0 billion loss. That probably spooked investors, as Intel's stock declined in the days after the April 2 presentation. Image source: Intel.\n\nYet Intel has already booked $15 billion in cumulative lifetime value from third parties as of April, and that revenue hasn't shown up yet. As these customers scale, Intel sees the Foundry segment breaking even by 2027, eventually reaching a target of 30% operating margin by 2030, with annual revenue greater than $15 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel's Products are forecast to get back to a 40% operating margin, where the company was back when it had process leadership. That should lead the overall company to a 35%-40% operating margin by 2030, with reasonable revenue assumptions. In a recent investor presentation, Intel's director of investor relations provided a model of about $100 billion in total revenue by 2030, based on reasonable industry growth prospects and regaining some market share Intel has lost.\n\nIntel's products will still take up the vast majority of its revenue if the external Foundry is at $15 billion in revenue, leaving about $85 billion for Intel Products revenue. Of note, Intel had $47.7 billion in Products revenue last year, even in a soft year for PCs and on lagging process technology. So that is really not that ambitious of an assumption in seven years' time.\n\nCheap for 2030\n\nAssuming Intel can hit these targets, which management has called reasonable and conservative, that would yield between $35 billion and $40 billion in 2030 operating income.\n\nIntel's market cap is only $140 billion today, which means if the company executes on this expensive and complicated turnaround, the stock is quite cheap, going for less than four times its potential 2030 operating income.\n\nOf course, the big questions around execution and the economic climate from now until then is are what's keeping the price down. But for optimists looking for cheap ways to play AI, this is a turnaround that may just be worth investing in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The consensus call for narrowing the earnings gap between Magnificent 7 stocks and the rest of the S&P 500 may still be overly optimistic, JPMorgan strategists said in a Monday note.\n\nThe bank highlighted that this recurring expectation has not materialized in the last five reporting seasons, with the Mag-7 consistently delivering larger positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises compared to the broader market.\n\nIn the current quarter, consensus projections estimate that the Mag-7 will continue to post significant earnings growth, albeit at a decelerated rate of 29% year-over-year, down from 53% in the previous quarter. The rest of the S&P 500 is projected to see a positive earnings growth of 5% year-over-year for the first time in five quarters.\n\nJPMorgan points out that the Mag-7 stocks, which include tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have been the primary contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth for several quarters. However, the market's high valuation and extreme concentration leave little room for any disappointments.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is yet again betting on the convergence in earnings between Mag-7 and the rest, but that was disappointed on each of the past 5 occasions,\u201d the note states.\n\n\u201cThis could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again,\u201d it added.\n\nMore broadly, the Q2 reporting season is gaining momentum, with sequential activity improvements pointing to better earnings delivery, JPMorgan strategists said.\n\nConsensus estimates for Q2 EPS have seen minimal cuts, just 1% compared to the usual 5% three months prior to results. Analysts forecast a 15% EPS acceleration for the S&P 500 from Q1 to Q4, significantly above historical norms.\n\nSpecifically, Q2 EPS is expected to grow 9% year-over-year. Meanwhile, recent weak consumer data, including a decline in consumer confidence and ongoing weakness in China, suggest mixed company guidance ahead.\n\n\u201cThere has been a raft of profit warnings in consumer space in the past weeks, with poor stock reaction, but also in other areas,\u201d strategists wrote.\n\nThey also said defensive sectors are projected to outperform cyclicals in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Q1 2024 marked the first quarter since Q4 2020 where cyclical EPS growth lagged behind defensives. That trend is expected to continue, supported by falling bond yields and improving relative EPS trends for defensives, which have driven lower-beta leadership in recent months.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPM: Consensus call for EPS narrowing between Mag-7 and rest may be lacking\n\nStory continues\n\nKorean Air set to order about 20 Boeing 777X jets, sources say\n\nRepublican senator urges defense firm CEOs to safeguard Spirit work",

        "title": "Do Hedge Funds Think That Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Skyrocket Soon?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe primary lure of investing, as you're likely to know, is to make money. Every day thousands of investors pour into the market to pick out what they believe will be winners to make them rich. And, the market delivers as well. This has been quite clear in 2024, with the hype surrounding artificial intelligence having delivered previously unthinkable returns. Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the chipmaker that's responsible for providing the industry with GPUs to run AI workloads, has gained a whopping 636% since ChatGPT was released in November 2022. This stock ranks 4th in our list of \u00a0Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential, so if you haven't guessed by now, then do take a look.\n\nLooking at these spectacular returns, one would be hard pressed to conclude that if you want to make money on the stock market, then growth is the way to go. But as is the case with most things in life, details are lurking under the hood that go against this simple supposition. On this front, professors from the University of Illinois looked at the returns of large cap and small cap value and growth stocks starting from 1969 and ending in 2001. Taking a geometric mean of these returns, they revealed that large cap growth ('glamour') stocks delivered mean returns of 4.5%, 7.9%, and 3.8% between 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, respectively. On the other hand, large cap value stocks delivered returns of 16.4%, 20.4%, and 18% over the three respective time periods. What's more, is that the returns offered by the value stocks during 1969 and 2001 also surpassed the returns of the S&P 500 index which sat at 11.4%!\n\nBut what about small caps? After all, small caps are all the hype on Wall Street these days as investors position themselves for an interest rate cut. July 11th saw the S&P's flagship index bleed 91 basis points, with the technology heavy NASDAQ shedding 1.98%. The NASDAQ's drop was led by its 100 most valuable non financial companies which shed 2.15% during the same day. On the other hand, the rising fortunes of small cap stocks accelerated on the 11th. The leading small cap stock index gained 2% during the day and nearly matched this during the first half an hour of trading on the 12th by gaining 1.6% as it opened significantly higher after the after and pre market trading sessions.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these gains, you might be wondering which small cap stocks might be worth their while. Well, we looked at analyst sentiment as part of our coverage of 8 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready to Explode According to Analysts and hedge fund sentiment as part of 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential so you should check them out if you're interested in small cap stocks.\n\nComing back to the professors' research, during 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, small cap growth stocks, were down by 2.8%, 1.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. On the other hand, small cap value stocks delivered geometric mean returns of 18.3%, 22.8%, and 17.7%, respectively. Seems like over the long term, investing in value stocks appears to be just as, if not more, worthwhile while large cap growth stocks appear to fare better than their small cap. peers.\n\nWhile you might be thinking that these stats do not apply to the current market, it's also true that they are relevant to an extent especially since 1990 to 2001 was characterized by soaring valuations fuelled by internet stocks. Right now, AI is all that anyone can talk about, even as investors are moving out of big ticket technology names into the under appreciated small caps. Back then, the shares of a California based internet connectivity equipment provider soared by a whopping 53,207% between January 1991 and April 2000. So, this would have seen $1,000 invested during the start soar to $533,000 at the peak, which, fair to say, is life changing money for most of us. Yet, those same shares are down by 36% since then and had tumbled by as much as 79% by February 2009. If you're interested in knowing what this stock is, it ranked 8th on our list of the 10 Best Communication and Media Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt the same time, not all growth stocks end up lower. Some of the biggest examples that weathered the storm after the dotcom bubble popped are the largest companies today. They belong to the eCommerce, consumer and enterprise software, and the broader technology industries. Today's mega cap stocks have gained anywhere between 6,455% to 203,377% and 437,010% since they were listed for trading. Safe to say, these 'fads' of the time weren't fads and the market knew what it was doing.\n\nTheir returns are also what drive growth investors in droves to the stock market. While eCommerce and consumer technology were trends of the past, there are dozens of trends that newsletter publishers have embraced with open arms these days as they promise the next stock capable of delivering 10x or even 100x in returns. Since you're likely to be aware of AI at this point, we'll skip it out and list some other ideas. One of the biggest, and perhaps underreported ideas that newsletters have been pitching is quantum computing. Quantum computing expands the amount of data that a traditional computer can compute, and while its stocks haven't delivered strong returns yet, publishers believe that the future is bright. You can look at some quantum computing stocks and a broader industry overview by reading 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\n\nOne trend that has delivered returns is weight loss. Since March 2023, these stocks have delivered as much as 173% in returns, and with newer products such as pills under development, some folks believe that there's more room left for growth. Another highly pitched trend is energy, specifically nuclear energy, uranium miners, and energy infrastructure stocks. All these will benefit from the growth in electricity consumption from AI data centers, according to newsletter publishers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that might skyrocket, we scanned investment newsletters from Stock Gumshoe and narrowed down 20 stocks from newsletters dated back as far as June 13th. These were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 and the top ten stocks were chosen. Stock Gumshoe's thesis and the date of each newsletter are also mentioned.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 293\n\nDate of Newsletter: July 9th\n\nComing back to Navellier, this stock had a \"cash flow of $9.1 billion\" in Q4 2023 which puts it on track to become the \"largest company in the world for at least the next 10 years.\" Safe to say, this isn't a small cap stock or a startup. Some hints about its business model include the firm's operations in \"cloud computing, cybersecurity, software, gaming, hardware, search,\" and we'll make it easy for you by sharing that it isn't Google parent Alphabet. If you're an avid follower of the technology industry, you should have guessed it by now, but if you haven't, then Navellier reminds you that this stock can provide the \"perfect mix of stability and low risk.\"\n\nThis stock is the mega cap technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Navellier's latest stocks are all about QaaS, and Gumshoe also notes that two of China's largest technology conglomerates, Alibaba and Baidu have both given up on their quantum investments lately. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s forward P/E of 36x does make it expensive, and investing in an S&P linked fund could provide exposure to its stock coupled with other tech heavy weights.\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that will skyrocket. You can visit 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "MSFT, AMZN, or GOOGL: Which Cloud Computing Player is the Best AI Stock?",
        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) wave has boosted the prospects for various categories of companies within the tech sector, including semiconductor makers, cloud computing providers, and cybersecurity players. In particular, cloud computing companies are witnessing solid demand for their services that are required to support enterprises and developers in building their generative AI models.\n\nBearing this favorable backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to place Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) against each other to find the cloud computing company that is the best AI stock and could offer the highest returns from the current level, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader in the cloud infrastructure market, rival Microsoft Azure is catching up rapidly. In the March quarter (Q3 FY24 for MSFT), revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 31% compared to AWS\u2019 sales growth of 17% in the comparable quarter.\n\nDuring the Q3 FY24 earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Azure is grabbing market share, with customers using the company\u2019s platforms to build AI solutions. The CEO added that the company provides a diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the most recent offerings of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and MSFT\u2019s own AI chip.\n\nMicrosoft claims that over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI service, thanks to continued AI innovation that is backed by the company\u2019s strategic partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Overall, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business is seen as one of its key growth drivers.\n\nIs Microsoft a Buy or Sell?\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to announce its Q4 FY24 results on July 30. Analysts expect the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 9% year-over-year to $2.93.\n\nAhead of the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a Buy rating on MSFT stock and boosted the price target to $495 from $470. The analyst expects the company to deliver another upbeat quarter of growth and margins. He is optimistic about Azure\u2019s potential, with data points indicating continued growth acceleration trends. Overall, MSFT remains \u201cbest-positioned for AI monetization,\u201d according to Wood.\n\nWith 34 Buys versus one Hold recommendation, Microsoft stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MSFT stock price target of $504.12 implies 15.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares have advanced more than 16% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nDespite rising competition, Amazon\u2019s AWS unit continues to maintain a dominant position in the cloud computing market. According to Synergy Research Group, AWS commanded a 31% market share of the cloud infrastructure services market in Q1 2024, while Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud had market shares of 25% and 11%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS\u2019 sales grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion. This growth rate marked an acceleration compared to the 13% increase experienced in Q4 2023. It is worth noting that AWS is a vital growth engine for Amazon and is highly profitable. In Q1 2024, AWS accounted for 17.5% of the overall sales but contributed more than 61% of the company\u2019s operating income.\n\nAmazon is optimistic about the robust potential of its AWS business. CEO Andy Jassy stated during the Q1 2024 earnings call that the company is seeing notable momentum on the AI front, which is accumulating a \u201cmultibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Target Price for Amazon Stock?\n\nAhead of Amazon\u2019s Q2 results scheduled to be announced on August 1, analysts at Morgan Stanley reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock, with a positive near-term outlook. Morgan Stanley expects AMZN to report a notable EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) beat in the second quarter and issue favorable guidance for the third quarter.\n\nIn particular, Morgan Stanley\u2019s EBIT estimate is 17% higher than the Street\u2019s consensus for Q2 and 10% more than the Q3 forecast. The optimistic outlook is based on AMZN\u2019s North America Retail profitability and accelerating AWS growth.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Amazon\u2019s EPS to increase to $1.02 from $0.65 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAmazon stock earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 unanimous Buys. At $223.05, the average AZMN stock price target implies about 22% upside potential. Shares have risen 21% year-to-date.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nTech giant Alphabet is well known for its Google search engine. That said, the company\u2019s Google Cloud business is grabbing Wall Street\u2019s attention with its rapid growth. Alphabet impressed investors with its solid first-quarter results, which were driven by a major jump in Google Cloud\u2019s profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased 28.4% year-over-year to $9.57 billion, while its operating income surged to $900 million from $191 million in the prior-year quarter. The results reflected Alphabet\u2019s increased investments in the Cloud business. Interestingly, during the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the company introduced over 1,000 new products and features in its Cloud business over the past eight months.\n\nThe company believes that one of the aspects that differentiates its Cloud business from rivals is its AI Hypercomputer, which offers cost-effective and efficient infrastructure to train and support AI models.\n\nIs it a Good Time to Buy GOOGL?\n\nOn July 18, analysts at Jefferies reaffirmed a Buy rating on GOOGL stock with a price target of $220. They expect Alphabet to report strong Q2 results, supported by resilient customer spending and consistent Cloud business. However, Jefferies cautioned investors about slightly tougher comparisons in Q2, mainly in the ad business.\n\nAfter a solid year-to-date rally in GOOGL stock (up 27.2%), Jefferies expects continued rise but at a gradual pace due to high expectations following robust Q1 performance and above historical average valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet will announce its Q2 2024 results on July 23. Wall Street expects Alphabet\u2019s Q2 EPS to rise 27% to $1.83.\n\nWall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 33 Buys and six Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $202.89 indicates 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is bullish on the long-term growth potential of the top three cloud computing players, driven by the continued transition of enterprises to the cloud and AI-related tailwinds. Currently, they see slightly higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in Microsoft and Alphabet shares. Aside from the attractive growth potential of the AWS business, analysts\u2019 optimism about Amazon is also backed by the company\u2019s leadership in e-commerce and its growing advertising business.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Small businesses grapple with global tech outages created by CrowdStrike",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An owner of a consumer insights research firm couldn't pay her employees, make Friday's deadline to sign a contract for a new business or send key research to a key client. A psychiatrist, who runs a virtual mental health practice in Maryland, saw his business hobbled as some of his virtual assistants and therapists couldn't either make phone calls or log on to their computers. And a restaurant owner in New York City was worried about how he was going to pay his vendors and his workers.\n\nBusinesses from airlines to hospitals have been grappling with a faulty software update that caused technological havoc worldwide on Friday, and its repercussions continued through the weekend. The breadth of the outages highlighted the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services.\n\nBut the problem appeared to divide those affected into haves and have-nots. Major customers of Microsoft and CrowdStrike are getting IT support to resolve the issues, but many smaller businesses whose Windows PCs may have received the problematic update are still struggling.\n\nTake Tsvetta Kaleynska, owner and founder of the Manhattan-based consumer insights company RILA Global Consulting, which has Fortune 500 clients. As of Saturday, she resolved the payroll issue and she got an extension until Monday on the research project. But the prospective client will not move forward with the new contract, cutting her annual earnings by nearly 25%, she estimated. The problem: she couldn't sign the contract because Docusign, which runs on Microsoft software affected by the faulty update, was down.\n\n\u201cIf I were part of a big company, then I would be able to delegate and get support from computer science or security services,\u201d Kaleynska said. \u201cBut as a small business owner, I am depending only on myself. It's pretty devastating.\"\n\nOn top of Kaleynska's business issues, she had to bring her ill daughter to a local hospital Friday because the hospital's phone lines were down.\n\nKaleynska, an immigrant from Bulgaria who became a U.S. citizen in 2023, said she's learned a hard lesson: \u201cOur lives are very fragile because they\u2019re based on technology, and we depend on technology.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the largest cybersecurity firms in the U.S. and has a list of customers that includes more than half of the Fortune 500 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nFollowing the outage, the company provided an initial fix through a software update. But many computers are expected to need hands-on work that could take days, if not longer, to complete.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor many small businesses that are impacted, that could mean working around the clock this weekend to make sure their systems are up and running, said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses rely on third parties for this not to happen and instead, it became a \u2018code red\u2019 situation,\u201d Ives said.\n\nOverall, Ives noted tech problems can be easier to fix for big companies that have a sizable number of experts on their payroll as opposed to small businesses who could face more of an \u201cuphill battle\u201d because they have fewer technical resources.\n\n\u201cThe ripple effects from this could be felt for days and weeks ahead,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's not just a black eye moment for CrowdStrike, but for the broader industry. You can\u2019t have one fat finger update take down a global ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAri Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Heinz College, agreed, noting the amount of money big companies spend on Microsoft and CrowdStrike is likely a large portion of their IT budget. On the other hand, small businesses can look at information online on how to resolve the outage. CrowdStrike has posted step-by-step manual fixes to its blog, but it can be intimidating for those who are less tech savvy.\n\nLightman said those corporations could sue for a loss of business, but small ones might use class action suits to go after CrowdStrike for compensatory damages.\n\nThe issue is affecting small businesses differently.\n\nHeather Garlich, a spokeswoman at Arlington, Va., grocery industry group FMI, said the outages were \u201csomewhat spotty and inconsistent depending on how businesses use certain Microsoft tools.\u201d She said she was aware of one with an issue with a human resource system, while another had problems with their routing system for distribution. Yet another had issues with its cash registers.\n\nChris Seabrook, who owns a locksmith services business in Melbourne, Australia, called Asguard Locksmiths, told The Associated Press in a Friday email that the IT outage had thrown a \u201csignificant wrench\u201d in his daily operations. He hasn\u2019t been able to send and receive emails, access critical files, manage his schedule or create invoices.\n\n\u201cMy Microsoft PC is essential for many important functions in my business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a one-man business, every minute counts and this disruption has forced me to adapt quickly to ensure my services remain as uninterrupted as possible.\u201d\n\nTo minimize the disruption, Seabrook borrowed a non-Microsoft device from a friend that enabled him to sign into his accounts and access some of his critical tools and information. He\u2019s also using his smartphone for important messages and organizing his schedule. And he's been contacting clients to update them on the situation. Seabrook didn't immediately respond to a follow-up email sent by The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nSome small business owners have improvised to get work done.\n\nDr. Ozan Toy, a psychiatrist, and chief medical officer at the Maryland-based Telapsychiatry, which has 25 employees across the U.S., said some employees with Microsoft phone lines instead turned to the Ring Central System, while others shifted from Microsoft Teams to Zoom.\n\nToy said his business was fortunate to have several backups of its electronic medical record system, allowing them to resume communications with each other and their patients. As of Sunday, the practice's cloud based services were running, he said. Toy noted financial losses were \u201cminimal\u201d as it has an external answering service taking calls from patients.\n\nChris Delmond, the co-owner of Handcraft Hospitality, which operates three restaurants in Manhattan and one in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, said his restaurants remained open for business. But the outage meant he could not have access to his cloud-based accounting software app on the Microsoft platform. That prevented him from seeing receipts and invoices, and slowed his ability to process checks to his employees and suppliers. He had to resort to calling his banks to see whether deposits had been made and check balances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a small business owner. I have two other partners and we kind of do everything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s up to us to find out what the issues are. I don\u2019t have large platforms that help me track.\u201d\n\nBut by late Friday afternoon, all the issues related to his business' cloud based systems were back to normal, Delmond said. He noted he didn't suffer any financial losses, but he added, \u201cIt's frustrating, but as a small business owner you deal with the ups and downs.\"",

        "content": "The video game industry is on the cusp of a turnaround after a tumultuous few years that saw sales come back down to earth from the lofty heights they reached during the early days of the pandemic. And things should only get better in 2025, as Nintendo (NTDOY) prepares to launch a follow-up to its outrageously successful Switch console and Take-Two (TTWO) readies for the release of its highly anticipated \u201cGrand Theft Auto VI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that the games industry overall is poised for an upswing,\u201d former Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cJust this past month, late last month, there were a number of game announcements across the industry that consumers reacted really well to,\u201d said Fils-Aim\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThese are new games coming later this year. It's games that are coming in 2025. There's new platforms coming, namely from Nintendo, as well as rumors of an adaptation to the [PlayStation 5] coming. So there are a lot of positive things that signal that we've essentially gone through the trough for the video game industry, and now we're poised for an upswing.\u201d Take-Two's \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" is expected to be a strong catalyst for the game industry's recovery in 2025. (Chris Delmas /AFP via Getty Images) (CHRIS DELMAS via Getty Images)\n\nThe video game market experienced a boom during the beginning of the pandemic, as consumers around the world retreated to their homes with little to do but play video games and stream shows and movies.\n\nAccording to IDC, global mobile game revenue shot up 32.8% to $99.9 billion in 2020, while digital PC and Mac game spending jumped 7.4% to $35.6 billion. Home console game spending, meanwhile, soared 33.9% to $42.9 billion.\n\nBut that growth declined quickly in the following years. Mobile gaming revenue grew just 15% in 2021 before declining 3.3% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023. PC and Mac game sales climbed again in 2021 by 8.7% but fell 1.4% in 2022, though the segment experienced a slight uptick of 2.1% in 2023.\n\nAnd after rocketing in 2020, console game spending stalled out in 2021, with growth sitting at 0.7%, before revenue declined 3.4% in 2022. It did, however, return to growth in 2023.\n\nThose 2020 console sales were also buoyed by the launches of Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5 and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. But system sales struggled due to the supply chain crisis at the time, hindering growth. Nintendo is expected to launch the successor to its popular Switch console in 2025. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou had significant investment leading into the launch of new machines by Microsoft and by Sony. You had essentially free money,\u201d Fils-Aim\u00e9 explained. \u201cSo game developers were creating a plethora of content and, candidly, some content that probably shouldn't have been created that hit the marketplace. And it, candidly, just didn't do very well in 2023. So the market contracted.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThose declines also led to industrywide mass layoffs, with thousands of workers losing their jobs as companies ranging from Microsoft and Sony to Riot and Unity (U) cut positions. And the layoffs haven\u2019t stopped in 2024, with EA (EA) laying off some 5% of its workforce and Sega cutting 240 jobs.\n\nBut the downturn should be coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI think we're through the worst of it,\u201d explained Mat Piscatella, executive director and video game industry adviser at Circana.\n\n\u201cMobile has really been carrying the load the first half of the year and is the biggest reason why the overall content spending numbers have remained as strong as they have. Through the end of May, 2024 content spending on mobile gaming in the U.S. has grown 12% compared to a year ago. The PC, Cloud and Non-Console VR segment in the U.S. has also performed well, with spending also gaining 12% through the end of May compared to last year,\u201d Piscatella added.\n\nThe home console market, however, has continued to struggle, though it\u2019s expected to get reinforcements with fall game releases and the next-generation Nintendo console next year, not to mention a burgeoning handheld market led by Valve\u2019s Steam Deck portable system.\n\nAnd while growth is unlikely to be as wild as it was at the onset of the pandemic, it should still provide relief for the industry overall.

        "title": "Stock-Split Fever: 2 Recent Stock-Split Stocks and 1 That Could Be Next",
        "content": "This has been another year of high-profile stock-split announcements, including Walmart, ChipotleMexicanGrill, and LamResearch. And while stock splits do not change the underlying fundamentals of a company, they can boost interest in stocks. Moreover, there is some research to suggest that stock-split stocks outperform the market.\n\nHere are three stocks that have already split this year -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) -- plus one more that may split sometime soon, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's sky-high valuation could be a warning sign\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): There's no way to talk about stock-split mania without discussing Nvidia. Simply put, the stock market has gone gaga over Nvidia -- taking the company from a market cap of $280 billion to over $3 billion in just under two years.\n\nAs a result of its skyrocketing stock price, Nvidia's board of directors authorized a 10-for-1 stock split in May of this year, bringing the company's stock price down from over $1,200 to around $120.\n\nThat stock split, like all common stock splits, did not change any of the company's fundamentals.Similar to running a pizza cutter across a freshly baked pizza, a stock split simply divides what already exists into smaller, more manageable pieces; it doesn't create more pizza.\n\nUltimately, investors need to pay attention to Nvidia's fundamentals -- now more than ever. To put it bluntly, the company's stock is nearing levels that should give investors pause.\n\nTake the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, for example. Nvidia stock has a lifetime P/S ratio of 8.4x. That's much higher than the average stock, which trades with a P/S ratio closer to 3x.However, within the tech industry, P/S ratios of 6 to 10 are common.\n\nYet, what is truly concerning is that Nvidia's current P/S ratio isn't anywhere close to that range -- it's 37x. Accordingly, investors today are paying about 4 times above its long-term historical P/S average. NVDA PS Ratio ChartNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nSo, even after Nvidia's enormous revenue growth (company revenue has nearly tripled from $25 billion to $70 billion over the last two years), much of the rise of Nvidia's stock is coming from investors paying higher prices. In short, investors are paying up for future growth and hoping that the company can meet -- or beat -- rising sales expectations.\n\nThat's a risky proposition, meaning investors might want to look elsewhere for a better value.\n\nBroadcom's first-ever stock split could juice an already supercharged stock\n\nWill Healy(Broadcom): Broadcom just executed its first stock split. The technology giant has dramatically benefited from artificial intelligence (AI), and its stock has increased by more than 80% over the last year. Despite those gains, it is not necessarily too late to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom leverages AI in two ways. Its business-to-business chip solutions segment designs specialized semiconductors for its clients, and as such, it creates chips to support AI. Also, amid a growing enterprise software business, it can underpin a client's software needs.\n\nThose capabilities appeared to bolster its stock gains, particularly over the last year. That growth, in turn, likely prompted the 10-for-1 stock split it initiated on July 12.\n\nStill, investors should remember that Broadcom has been a growth stock throughout its history. The former Avago Technologies launched its IPO at a split-adjusted price of just $1.50 per share in 2009. During that time, the stock price grew by more than 100-fold. So massive was its growth that its dividend, now at $2.10 per share annually, is 40% higher than the original IPO price!\n\nDespite such increases, investors have to look past a critical financial metric. In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended May 5), net income of $3.4 billion dropped 53% yearly. That may deter investors, especially since that contributed to the P/E ratio rising to 69.\n\nAdmittedly, the high P/E ratio makes it expensive, and the stock is likely not invulnerable to a downturn should market sentiment change.\n\nHowever, investors should keep in mind that revenue rose 39% yearly over the same period, and the company used some of the revenue increase to invest in itself when it increased operating expenses by 150%. Such actions could increase profits in the long term, taking the stock price higher over time.\n\nAdditionally, the split could help as the lower nominal price makes whole shares more affordable, a factor that should add to its considerable long-term gains.\n\nTech giant Microsoft is becoming an increasingly obvious stock-split candidate.\n\nJustin Pope (Microsoft): Tech giant Microsoft hasn't split its stock in recent memory, but that could soon change. The company frequently split during the 1990s until the infamous dot-com bubble popped in 2000. Shares plunged and took nearly two decades to recover.\n\nBut Microsoft has now risen to levels few may have predicted. Technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence have continued to fuel non-stop growth over the past decade: MSFT Chart\n\nNow, shares are much higher than they were years ago. Investors and employees sitting on massive investment returns from holding stock may not want to sell in $400 to $500 increments. A stock split would lower the share price and give them some flexibility. It would also make it easier for those buying stock to build a position without having a lot of money for big purchases.\n\nA potential stock split may become more sensible over time. Analysts believe Microsoft will grow earnings by an average of over 16% annually for the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 34, which is reasonable considering Microsoft's anticipated growth.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nShares are poised to climb higher on strong earnings growth over the coming years, so a split only makes sense. Investors should keep Microsoft on their radar as the next potential stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Microsoft Stock Is Great, But I'm Not Buying Because of This Huge Red Flag",
        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors have done very well for themselves over the past few years. It doesn't hold the title of the world's largest company at the moment, but Microsoft retained that position for many months due to its strong success.\n\nAlthough practically any time in the past has been a great time to buy Microsoft stock, I'm avoiding it right now due to one huge red flag, which I think it could be a dealbreaker for the stock.\n\nMicrosoft is excelling\n\nTo use a Microsoft Office pun, Microsoft excels as a business. All three business segments are doing great, with each one growing revenue at a strong pace.\n\nThe intelligent cloud segment led the way, with revenue growing by 21% to $26.7 billion. This division houses Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business. Because many artificial intelligence (AI) models are run on Azure's infrastructure, it's benefiting tremendously from the AI arms race.\n\nAfter multiple quarters of underperformance, the more personal computing segment (which includes its gaming and hardware divisions) grew revenue by 17%. This was heavily influenced by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which is likely why it grew revenue in the quarter versus the more historical trend of shrinking sales.\n\nFinally, Productivity and Business Processes, which includes all of its Office subscriptions, saw revenue grow by 12%. This was the weakest division, but 12% growth is still healthy.\n\nIn the third quarter of its fiscal year 2024, ended March 31, Microsoft knocked it out of the park. And it will likely do so again when it reports Q4 earnings on July 30. But, to own the stock, you have to pay a hefty premium, which is where my red flag comes from.\n\nMicrosoft's stock is too expensive compared to its peers\n\nBecause Microsoft's stock run-up has occurred at a quicker pace than its earnings growth, the stock has a premium valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 33 times forward earnings, Microsoft stock isn't cheap. Compared to the S&P 500, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings, investors have to pay up to be a Microsoft shareholder. Because the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio uses analysts' estimates, it's not a perfect measure. A better use for this metric is to compare it to its historical average P/E ratio to determine what expectations are built into the stock.\n\nOver the past five years, it traded for 32 times trailing earnings. This indicates that after a year's growth, Microsoft would return to its average valuation.\n\nHowever, the past five years have been unique with low interest rates, so this estimation may be aggressive when determining a long-term P/E ratio. Suppose we lower the P/E ratio to 25 times earnings, a more historical average valuation for a company with best-in-class execution. In that case, Microsoft must grow its earnings by 54% to reach that figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not an insurmountable growth rate, but it does require sacrificing a couple of years of growth.\n\nSo, while Microsoft's business will likely continue doing well, I'm concerned that the stock has already pulled those gains forward. Instead of Microsoft, I'd consider other big tech stocks like Alphabet or Meta Platforms that already trade around that 25 times earnings mark. Additionally, these two are also growing at similar or faster speeds than Microsoft, meaning their business growth will more directly translate to stock price appreciation.\n\nI think Microsoft is a great business, but the price investors have to pay is just too rich at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

ATMs stopped working, flights were delayed, and crucial healthcare services went offline.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the incident was caused by a \"defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" and that a fix had already \"been deployed.\" Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which was initially blamed for the outage because it only occurred on Windows systems, said it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve those issues.\n\nCrowdStrike certainly made a massive mistake and the market's reaction is understandable. But others are wondering if this news-driven pullback represents a good buying opportunity. Are they right? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did CrowdStrike's outage cause so much damage?\n\nIn the past, most cybersecurity companies installed on-site appliances to run their services. But that hardware was expensive, sucked up power, took up a lot of space, and required constant maintenance.\n\nCrowdStrike addressed those issues with Falcon, a cloud-native endpoint security platform that didn't require any on-site appliances. As a cloud-based platform, Falcon was easier to install, scale, and update than appliance-based platforms. It also enabled CrowdStrike to lock clients into sticky recurring subscriptions and cross-sell more cloud-based modules to grow its revenue per customer.\n\nThose strengths have enabled CrowdStrike to grow like a weed since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65%, from $250 million to $3.06 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike now serves 298 of the Fortune 500 companies and 538 of the Fortune 1000 companies. However, that widespread adoption explains why CrowdStrike's flawed update caused so much damage in such a short time.\n\nHow fast was CrowdStrike growing?\n\nOver the past year, as macro headwinds forced many companies to rein in their spending, CrowdStrike's growth in both ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) and total revenue decelerated. But its net new ARR growth rose by double-digit percentages year over year again over the past three quarters -- which meant it was still gaining new customers in a challenging market.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = year over year. Note: Ending ARR is the sum of preexisting ARR with net new ARR.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike attributed that robust growth to its market-share gains, new government contracts, and the rollout of more generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for Falcon. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% a year earlier.\n\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, Kurtz notably took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) new platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- saying \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\" Unfortunately, CrowdStrike's recent software blunder might just drive some companies to try out Palo Alto's more diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services instead.\n\nAt the time, CrowdStrike expected its revenue to grow 30%-31% in fiscal 2025. It also planned to continue its five-quarter streak of profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But given those estimates (which will likely be reduced) and its current enterprise value of $67.5 billion, it still looks expensive at 17 times this year's sales.\n\nWill this outage impact CrowdStrike's long-term growth?\n\nThe big question now is how much this fiasco will throttle CrowdStrike's long-term growth. Bulls will argue that the company's leadership of the cloud-native cybersecurity space, its sticky cloud-based ecosystem, and the high costs of switching to another platform will prevent it from losing too many customers in the aftermath of the IT outage.\n\nHowever, Kurtz admitted it would take \"some time\" before the problem update was rolled back and all of the affected systems were fully restored. CrowdStrike could also be hit by plenty of lawsuits after this debacle, and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said his company had already \"deleted CrowdStrike\" from all of its systems.\n\nThe incident also made CrowdStrike, which hadn't been widely recognized outside of tech and business circles, a household name in the worst possible way. Warren Buffett once said it \"takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it\" -- and the damage to CrowdStrike's brand could certainly erode its defenses against its eager competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has been quietly expanding its own cloud-based cybersecurity platform over the past few years, with big investments and acquisitions. This embarrassing incident could drive Microsoft to accelerate the development of those internal services, in order to curb its dependence on CrowdStrike and other third-party cybersecurity platforms.\n\nSo is CrowdStrike's pullback a buying opportunity?\n\nI own shares of CrowdStrike, but I think it would need to pull back even further before it's considered a bargain. It's still up more than 90% over the past 12 months and isn't cheap -- and we can't yet gauge the long-term impact of this disastrous outage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chinese cybersecurity companies are taking advantage of the massive Microsoft Windows outage that upended businesses and grounded flights around the world on Thursday and Friday by promoting their own software, as Beijing pushes to cut the country's reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nAustin, Texas-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused the outage, one of the largest in history, by pushing a bad software update that crashed the Windows operating system. It affected airports, banks, and hospitals, among many other businesses.\n\n360 Security Technology, China's largest cybersecurity firm, took the opportunity to promote its products, which it claimed were \"more reliable, stable, comprehensive and intelligent\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Xinhua alt=Visitors tour the Chinese internet security firm Qihoo 360 booth at the World 5G Convention in Beijing on November 21, 2019. Photo: Xinhua>\n\nQAX, another well-known firm in the sector, wrote in a blog post on Friday that \"software vendors involved in system stability need to have stricter quality control of their software\".\n\nTencent Holdings, which operates the Tencent PC Manager platform, said on Friday that it received reports from some users who experienced the Windows error screen, known as the blue screen of death. It referred users to CrowdStrike's official workaround steps to resolve the problem.\n\nThe incident adds to Beijing's list of reasons for seeking to move away from foreign technology as it pursues technological self-reliance in the face of mounting export restrictions and sanctions from Washington. Key infrastructure was largely unaffected in China, where only foreign businesses and luxury hotels were hit.\n\nWhile Microsoft said on Friday that its systems had been restored, many businesses continued to deal with the fallout.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, whose passenger check-in system collapsed, issued a notice on Saturday saying operations had returned to normal.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's cybersecurity market is dominated by local players. Beijing has long been phasing out software from companies like Russia's Kaspersky Lab and US-based Symantec. CrowdStrike does not sell products and services in China, according to its website.\n\nCrowdStrike shares fell 11.1 per cent to US$304.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday, while Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent. Competitors SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks gained 7.85 per cent and 2.16 per cent, respectively.\n\nWhile China has pursued technological self-reliance to varying degrees for decades, the government's mistrust of foreign commercial software deepened after the 2013 leaks from US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed methods that the National Security Agency used to access information from some of the world's biggest tech companies.\n\nThe government made a concerted push to completely switch to domestic security software a decade ago, according to a 2014 report by state-owned China News Service.\n\nAll the departments of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have installed 360 software, the report said, and state-owned enterprises would follow by also installing domestic alternatives.\n\nCrowdStrike has made monitoring for Chinese cyberattacks an important part of its business, as Western countries have warned of an increasing number of attacks coming from China-linked actors.\n\nIn 2015, the company reported seven Chinese cyberattacks against US technology and pharmaceutical companies. China's foreign affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at the time that \"the Chinese government would not in any way participate, encourage or support enterprises in engaging in the theft of trade secrets\".\n\nIn its latest annual report, CrowdStrike said that \"China-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third-party relationships\" in 2023.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Malicious actors trying to exploit global tech outage for their own gain",
        "content": "As the world continues to recover from massive business and travel disruptions caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, malicious actors are trying to exploit the situation for their own gain.\n\nGovernment cybersecurity agencies across the globe and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz are warning businesses and individuals about new phishing schemes that involve malicious actors posing as CrowdStrike employees or other tech specialists offering to assist those recovering from the outage.\n\n\u201cWe know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,\u201d Kurtz said in a statement. \u201cI encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you\u2019re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\u201d\n\nThe UK Cyber Security Center said they have noticed an increase in phishing attempts around this event.\n\nMicrosoft said 8.5 million devices running its Windows operating system were affected by the faulty cybersecurity update Friday that led to worldwide disruptions. That\u2019s less than 1% of all Windows-based machines, Microsoft cybersecurity executive David Weston said in a blog post on Saturday.\n\nHe also said such a significant disturbance is rare but \u201cdemonstrates the interconnected nature of our broad ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWhat's happening with air travel?\n\nWith their tightly timed, interwoven schedules and complex technology systems, many big airlines struggle to stay on time when everything goes well. It perhaps was not surprising that the industry was among the hardest hit by the outage, with crews and planes caught out of position.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Saturday on the U.S. East Coast, airlines around the world had canceled more than 2,000 flights, according to tracking service FlightAware. That was down from 5,100-plus cancellations on Friday.\n\nAbout 1,600 of Saturday\u2019s canceled flights occurred in the United States, where carriers scrambled to get planes and crews back into position after massive disruptions the day before. According to travel data provider Cirium, U.S. carriers canceled about 3.5% of their scheduled flights for Saturday. Only Australia was hit harder.\n\nCanceled flights were running at about 1% in the United Kingdom, France and Brazil and about 2% in Canada, Italy and India among major air-travel markets.\n\nRobert Mann, a former airline executive and now a consultant in the New York area, said it was unclear exactly why U.S. airlines were suffering disproportionate cancellations, but possible causes include a greater degree of outsourcing of technology and more exposure to Microsoft operating systems that received the faulty upgrade from CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich airlines are getting hit the hardest?\n\nDelta Air Lines canceled more than 800 flights, or one-fourth of its schedule for Saturday, and that number did not include Delta Connection regional flights. It was followed by United Airlines, which dropped nearly 400 flights.\n\nThe worst airport to be, for a second straight day, was Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where Delta is the dominant carrier. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that thousands of people spent the night at the airport, many sleeping on the floors.\n\nEuropean airlines and airports appeared to be recovering slowly, although Lufthansa and its affiliates canceled dozens of flights. Its Eurowings budget subsidiary said check-in, boarding, booking and rebooking flights were all available again, although \u201cisolated disruptions\u201d were possible.\n\nLondon\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was busy but operating normally on Saturday and that \u201call systems are back up and running.\" Flights at Berlin\u2019s main airport were departing on or close to schedule, German Press Agency dpa reported, citing an airport spokesman.\n\nHow are healthcare systems holding up?\n\nHealth care systems affected by the outage faced clinic closures, canceled surgeries and appointments and restricted access to patient records.\n\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif., said \u201csteady progress has been made\u201d to bring its servers back online and thanked its patients for being flexible during the crisis.\n\n\u201cOur teams will be working actively through the weekend as we continue to resolve remaining issues in preparation for the start of the work week,\u201d the hospital wrote in a statement.\n\nIn Austria, a leading organization of doctors said the outage exposed the vulnerability of relying on digital systems. Harald Mayer, vice president of the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, said the outage showed that hospitals need analog backups to protect patient care.\n\nThe organization also called on governments to impose high standards in patient data protection and security, and on health providers to train staff and put systems in place to manage crises.\n\n\u201cHappily, where there were problems, these were kept small and short-lived and many areas of care were unaffected\u201d in Austria, Mayer said.\n\nThe Schleswig-Holstein University Hospital in northern Germany, which canceled all elective procedures Friday, said Saturday that systems were gradually being restored and that elective surgery could resume by Monday.\n\nWill the tech industry face a reckoning?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that surprised that an accident caused severe global digital disruption. I was a little surprised that the cause of it was a software update from a very well-respected cybersecurity company,\u201d said Oxford University management professor Ciaran Martin, a former chief executive of the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Center.\n\n\u201cThere are some very hard questions for CrowdStrike. How on earth did this update get through quality control?\" he said. \"Clearly the testing regime, whatever it is, failed.\u201d\n\nMartin said governments in the U.K. and the European Union will be powerless to take steps to prevent such breakdowns \u201cbecause we have become dependent on a very American version of technology, and the power to do anything about that doesn\u2019t rest in this continent.\u201d\n\nOther analysts doubted that the outage would lead Washington or any other government to propose new mandates on tech companies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the mandate would be. Do better QA?\u201d said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier, using an acronym for quality assurance.\n\nWhat did scam artists learn from the outage?\n\nGrenier expects that a majority of affected machines will be fixed in about a week, with more time needed to reach laptops used by far-flung workers because the work can\u2019t be done remotely \u2013 it\u2019s a hands-on operation.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be scammers trying to take advantage of businesses that have indicated they were affected by the outage.\n\n\u201cThe threat is very real,\u201d Grenier said. \u201cBad actors have the information to send targeted phishing emails and calls. They know what endpoint-protection tools you use. They know you use CrowdStrike.\u201d\n\nGrenier said affected businesses need to make sure they use a fix supplied by CrowdStrike. \u201cDon\u2019t accept the help of somebody coming out of the blue and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll fix that for you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nIsabella O\u2019Malley in Philadelphia, Stephen Graham in Berlin and Technology writer Matt O'Brien contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CrowdStrike Shares Trim Heavy Losses As Microsoft Announces Resolution Of Global Tech Outage: 'This Is Clearly A Major Black Eye'\n\nU.S. cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is attempting to recover sharp premarket losses felt overnight and in the early hours on Friday as an update on its cloud software triggered a global tech outage.\n\nWhat Happened: A failed update of CrowdStrike's Falcon platform on Thursday night led to widespread disruptions in Microsoft systems, pushing critical global services such as airports, ports, financial institutions and hospitals to a standstill. The issue stemmed from a technical error in the software update, ruling out initial speculation of a hacker attack.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.

(NYSE:S), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and Okta Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) saw their shares rise by 6.3%, 2.9%, and 1% respectively.\n\nWhile Microsoft's Windows systems were impacted, Mac and Linux hosts remained unaffected, as confirmed by CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz.

        "content": "A passenger waits at Gatwick Airport as flights were hit by delays and cancellations following the global IT outage - Benjamin Cremel/AFP\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have had their foreign summer holidays thrown into jeopardy by a global IT outage that caused chaos at British airports on Friday.\n\nAround 200,000 people are set to be hit by delays and cancellations caused by the IT meltdown, which was triggered by a faulty update to a widely-used piece of cyber security software. Many travel insurers are refusing to pay to rearrange holidays.\n\nNHS services, train services, cash machines and contactless payments were also taken offline, with 999 services facing long delays after GP surgeries were unable to make appointments.\n\nThe worldwide IT outage was caused by a glitch in cyber security software made by CrowdStrike, a US company, which caused millions of computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows to crash suddenly on Friday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt resulted in a so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, sending the computers into recovery mode.\n\nAn emergency meeting of Cobra officials was called to address the chaos, and Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, said her department was \u201cworking at pace with industry and across Government on the issue\u201d.\n\nWhile most of the technical problems were resolved by Friday night, the impact on summer holidays is expected to last for days.\n\nFriday was scheduled to be the busiest day at British airports since October 2019 as schools broke up for the summer holidays.\n\nAs 5,078 flights were cancelled globally on Friday, including around 160 UK flights, passengers were hit with queues of more than three and a half hours.\n\nStaff at airports from Heathrow to Bangkok were forced to manually check-in travellers after the technical glitch sent their systems into meltdown. Edinburgh Airport halted all arriving flights for around two hours on Friday as aircraft backed up on the Tarmac.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair urged passengers to leave airports, saying: \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDelta and United Airlines both imposed so-called ground stops on Friday morning, preventing flights from taking off while airline staff rushed to fix crippled computers.\n\nThe disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position to run their scheduled services.\n\nPassengers who have had their flights cancelled also face problems if trying to recoup lost costs from travel insurers, as many do not cover accommodation if travel is disrupted. MoneySuperMarket, the comparison site, confirmed that there were likely to be hundreds of travel policies that would not provide any cover for Friday\u2019s events. Disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position for scheduled services - Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nPaul Charles, a travel expert, said: \u201cIt will take until Monday to recover. It\u2019s turmoil that the industry doesn\u2019t need on one of the busiest weekends of the year.\u201d\n\nMr Charles estimated that 25,000 people were directly affected by the cancellation of nearly 300 flights to and from the UK.\n\nAirlines are responsible for arranging a replacement flight but may struggle to accommodate people, with travel experts warning that most flights were already expected to be fully booked.\n\nTravellers hoping to rebook their own travel faced having to arrange their own transfers, with routes to some popular destinations, such as Athens, no longer having direct flights available.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CrowdStrike chief executive, told NBC, the US broadcaster, he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the fault and admitted it would be \u201csome time\u201d before all the problems were resolved. He confirmed that the incident was not a cyber attack.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s software is widely used by businesses and is designed to protect companies from hacking, but a broken file included within a routine update to the technology almost immediately broke Windows computers that had the programme installed.\n\nThe company said it had since managed to fix the problem, but IT experts warned that many businesses were having to manually repair their computer systems.\n\nGP surgeries in Britain were unable to access patient records or book appointments, with the NHS advising people only to contact a doctor if their ailment was urgent.\n\nCancer appointments were cancelled at some hospitals as radiology departments were hit by the outage, and some NHS systems remained down on Friday evening. The National Pharmacy Association warned that disruption was likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nHolidaymakers hoping to use the railways for a getaway were also hit by the disruption. Thameslink, Southern Rail and Gatwick Express faced \u201cwidespread IT issues across our entire network\u201d that left bosses unable to tell drivers which trains they were meant to be working on.\n\nSouth Western Railway said all its ticket machines had stopped working on Friday morning. National Rail Enquiries advised passengers to \u201cpurchase your ticket online, on the train or speak to a member of station staff\u201d.\n\nOn the high street, card payment systems at Waitrose and Gail\u2019s, the bakery chain, stopped working, with staff having to take cash instead.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange\u2019s in-house news service went offline, while Sky News was forced to pull its morning broadcast and replace it with pre-recorded footage.\n\nAdam Leon Smith, a cyber security expert at the British Computer Society, said it could take \u201cdays and weeks\u201d for some companies to get back online, while Ciaran Martin, a former head of GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, estimated that the economic damage from the glitch would \u201crun into the billions\u201d.\n\n07:12 PM BST\n\nWrapping up...\n\nThanks for joining us on this live coverage of a widespread technology outage, which affected companies and services around the world, grounding flights, knocking GP systems offline and preventing many people from paying for their shopping.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide.\n\nThe company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, noting that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\n06:58 PM BST\n\nIT meltdown shows how horrifyingly exposed we are to total economic collapse\n\nOver-dependence on cloud software has left the world one glitch away from disaster, writes business columnist Matthew Lynn:\n\nThe planes stopped flying, the trains stopped running and countless other services were disrupted around the world.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long the outage that hit global computer systems on Friday lasts. With any luck, it will be fixed quickly and the damage will be relatively minor.\n\nAnd yet one point is surely clear: from the abolition of cash to the reliance on just-in-time supplies, we have become terrifyingly dependent on a tiny number of cloud-based computer systems.\n\nWe may be just one glitch away from a total economic collapse \u2013 and worst of all, for all the fashionable talk of \u201csecuronomics\u201d, our political leaders are just making that worse.\n\nOver the course of Friday, chaos rippled out across the world.\n\nRead the full article...\n\n06:56 PM BST\n\nPensions and ISAs giant Vanguard says services restored\n\nInvestment platform Vanguard has emailed customers to say that services have been restored. It said:\n\nWe are aware of technical issues you may have experienced on our UK Personal Investor platform today due to a 3rd party global IT issue.\n\nHowever, we are pleased to confirm our services have resumed and you can access your Vanguard account.\n\n06:51 PM BST\n\nGail\u2019s bakery investor attacks Crowdsource\n\nA serial restaurant entrepreneur who formerly chaired Channel 4 has attacked CrowdSource, expressing surprise that the cyber security business has not plunged by more on the stock market today.\n\nLuke Johnson is an investor in Gail\u2019s bakery, which was unable to accept card payments as a result of the outage. He noted that the CrowdSource\u2019s shares are highly priced compared to the business\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t the shares collapsed 50pc or more?\u201d he said.\n\nShares are currently down 12.3pc.

Travel warns of potential for lost bags\n\nA traveller at Gatwick Airport said he had been queuing for more than three-and-a-half hours ahead of a flight to Miami, Florida.\n\nDean Seddon, 42, from Plymouth, told the PA news agency: \u201cThere are just people everywhere, there must be 400 people in this queue for the check-in desk I\u2019m at ... it\u2019s just bedlam.\u201d\n\nLance and Penny Spraggons said they had been waiting in a queue to check in at the West Sussex airport for more than an hour.\n\nMr Spraggons said: \u201cThe biggest problem is the lack of information.\u201d\n\nThe queue at Stansted snaked outside the main terminal building.\n\nCourtney Kemal, 32, who had been in the queue for around two hours by late morning, said her two sons aged five and seven were \u201cobviously getting stressed\u201d.\n\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said passengers due to travel today \u201cwill naturally be deeply concerned\u201d.\n\nHe went on: \u201cIf you can, avoid checking in a bag as queues for check-in at the airport will be long and IT failures typically lead to lots of lost bags.\n\n\u201cIf you do check-in bags, make sure you keep medication, keys and any other essentials in your hand luggage.\u201d\n\nHe said passengers will not be eligible for compensation for delayed or cancelled fights due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, but airlines have a duty to look after them, including providing meals, accommodation and alternative flight bookings if necessary.\n\n06:11 PM BST\n\nPharmacies warn of weekend disruption while outage hit 60pc of GP practices\n\nThe National Pharmacy Association has warned that disruption from today\u2019s IT outage is likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nThousands of GP practices have also been affected by the outage today, with NHS England confirming there has been an issue with the EMIS Web system, which is understood to be used by about 60pc of practices in England.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England said:\n\nThe NHS has long-standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP.\n\nThere is currently no known impact on 999 or emergency services, so people should use these services as they usually would.\n\nThere are also some issues with administrative systems in hospitals that mean staff are having to work manually from paper to manage certain tasks but in the majority of hospitals, care is continuing as normal.\n\nPatients should attend appointments unless told otherwise. Only contact your GP if it\u2019s urgent, and otherwise please use 111 online or call 111.\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said:\n\nOur members are telling us that today\u2019s outage is causing considerable disruption to GP practice bookings and IT systems - practices using EMIS IT systems appear to be particularly affected.\n\nOutages like this affect our access to important clinical information about our patients, as well as our ability to book tests, make referrals, and inform the most appropriate treatment plan.\n\nShe asked patients to \u201ctry and wait\u201d until the outage is resolved if their issue is not urgent.\n\nEMIS Web is the most widely used clinical system for primary care in the UK.\n\nIt enables GP practices to book appointments, examine records and manage admin.\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nCancelled UK departures reach 143\n\nSome 143 flights scheduled to depart UK airports on Friday have been cancelled amid the global IT outage, aviation analytics company Cirium said.\n\nThis equates to 4.6pc of scheduled departures, the firm said, while 142 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled.\n\n05:52 PM BST\n\nCrowdStrike rivals jump on stock market\n\nRivals to CrowdStrike jumped on the stock market, while the company at the centre of today\u2019s outage has plunged.\n\nThe outage could force customers and investors alike to rethink their dependence on the company, opening the door to potential rivals like Palo Alto Networks, which saw its stock rise 1.7pc on Friday, and Sentinel One, which jumped as much as 3.6pc.\n\nGil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson, said:\n\nThis event is a reminder of how complex and intertwined our global computing systems are and how vulnerable they are to a mistake and an error.\n\nWhile most companies don\u2019t really have an alternative to Microsoft, they do have alternatives for security.\n\nThis may cause many companies to reconsider which security product they use, and whether they need to diversify across different security products in order to prevent these types of outages.\n\nHowever, other analysts said that while Friday\u2019s events had been damaging for CrowdStrike, they did not foresee competitors taking much market share as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike and the stock will be under pressure,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, but he noted that the incident stemmed from a technical update and not a hack or cybersecurity threat, which he said would be \u201cmore worrying\u201d.\n\n05:42 PM BST\n\nOutage requires \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to fix, says IT analyst\n\nFixing today\u2019s IT outage is not an easy fix, requiring \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to remediate, a leading analyst has said.\n\nEric Grenier of Gartner said:\n\nThe fix is working, it\u2019s just a very manual process and there\u2019s no magic key to unlock it. I think that is probably what companies are struggling with the most here.\n\nWhile not everyone is a client of CrowdStrike and its platform known as Falcon, it is one of the leading cybersecurity providers, particularly in the transportation and banking sectors that have a lot at stake in keeping their computer systems working.\n\nGregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University, said:\n\nThey\u2019re usually risk-averse organisations that don\u2019t want something that\u2019s crazy innovative, but that can work and also cover their butts when something goes wrong. That\u2019s what CrowdStrike is. And they\u2019re looking around at their colleagues in other sectors and saying, \u201cOh, you know, this company also uses that, so I\u2019m gonna need them, too.\u201d\n\n05:33 PM BST\n\nElon Musk says CrowdStrike deleted from his systems\n\nThe billionaire behind Telsa, SpaceX and and social media giant X has posted: \u201cWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems\u201d.\n\nWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 19, 2024\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft suggests turning computers off and on again\n\nWhile IT engineers are bogged down trying to fix thousands of broken computers, Microsoft says one solution may simply be to turn them off and on again. Matt Field reports:\n\nIn a technical update to customers, Microsoft said some \u201cvirtual machines\u201d - often used for home-working computers - could be fixed by repeatedly turning them off and on, 404media reported.\n\n\u201cWe have received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe high tech advice echoes that given in the Channel 4 show, The IT Crowd, in which Chris O\u2019Dowd\u2019s character\u2019s catchphrase is: \u201cHello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?\u201d\n\nIn the latest technical update from CrowdStrike, the company said the bug in its update was sent out at around 5.09am this morning, impacting millions of computers.\n\n05:16 PM BST\n\nNew York regulators say banks should be on high alert of cyber attacks\n\nNew York state regulators urged banks and companies to be on high alert amid the global tech outage on Friday, saying it is monitoring institutions and market events and working with other state and federal regulators.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services \u201creminds all regulated entities to be vigilant at this time. Threat actors have been known to launch attacks during periods when IT and security staff are distracted, especially through social engineering,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe department supervises more than 3,000 financial institutions in New York.\n\n05:14 PM BST\n\nFixing the IT outage could take \u2018weeks\u2019, says industry expert\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks.\n\nMicrosoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux - and so this could have been much worse.\n\nCrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been impacted by the bug.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\n05:09 PM BST\n\nMore than 2,600 flights cancelled so far\n\nOut of over 110,000 scheduled commercial flights on Friday, 2,691 have been cancelled globally so far and more are expected to be called off, according to data from global aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n\nIn Edinburgh, a Reuters witness said boarding pass scanners carried a \u201cserver offline message\u201d, with the airport saying passengers shouldn\u2019t travel to the airport without checking their flight status online first.\n\nElsewhere, airports and airlines advised customers to arrive earlier than normal for flights. Analysts said the outage was likely tied to a glitch in Microsoft software used globally.\n\nThe aviation sector is hit particularly hard due to its sensitivity to timings. Airlines rely on a closely coordinated schedule often run by air traffic control. Just one delay of a few minutes can throw off a flight schedule for take-offs and landings for an airport and airline for the rest of the day.

While not a cyberattack, the outage is a worrisome reminder of how our systems are deeply integrated.\n\n04:57 PM BST\n\nHeathrow Airport \u2018working hard\u2019 to minimise effects of the outage\n\nHeathrow Airport said it is \u201cworking hard\u201d to get passengers \u201con their way\u201d following a major global IT outage. It added:\n\nWe continue to work with our airport colleagues to minimise the impact of the global IT outage on passenger journeys.\n\nFlights continue to be operational and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information.\n\n04:55 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft urges customers to follow Crowdstrike guidance\n\nMicrosoft has put out a statement saying:\n\nWe are aware of a scenario in which customers experience issues with their machines causing a bug check [blue screen] due to a recent CrowdStrike update. We recommend customers to follow guidance provided by CrowdStrike.\n\n04:52 PM BST\n\nAmbulance service receiving more calls amid IT outage\n\nThe North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) said it is experiencing a \u201chigher volume\u201d of calls from patients who are not able to contact other NHS providers following global IT issues.\n\nTaryn Lake, director of finance and digital at NEAS, said:\n\nSo far, we have experienced minor disruption to our services as the result of the national IT outage.\n\nWe are currently working with partners for the continuity of our service.\n\nHowever, we are experiencing a higher volume in calls from patients who are unable to contact other NHS providers and we are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nI am signing off at this point for a lie down and to get as far away from any computers as possible. I will hand over the reins to Alex Singleton.\n\n04:41 PM BST\n\nFlight cancelled or delayed? Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nFlights around the world have been disrupted after a massive outage caused Windows computers to suddenly shut down.\n\nChief consumer and culture editor Nick Trend explains what you need to know about refunds and compensation:\n\nOn Ryanair\u2019s website, the company urged passengers to arrive at airports three hours early, blaming a \u201cthird-party IT issue, which is outside Ryanair\u2019s control and affecting all airlines operating across the network\u201d.\n\nTravellers at airports including Gatwick, Los Angeles and Madrid have shared photos on social media showing long queues as airlines grapple with increasing delays. Air passengers in India were even given hand-written boarding passes in an effort to keep things running smoothly.\n\nWhat are passengers caught up in the chaos entitled to? The detail around customer rights in this area is sometimes complicated, but the main principles are straightforward.\n\nFrom severe weather to tech outages and air traffic control issues, read your rights if your flight is cancelled or delayed.

But now it looks like they are checking bags so we might stay.\u201d\n\nAmerican Airlines said in a post on social media platform X that it had been able to \u201csafely re-establish our operation\u201d following a \u201ctechnical issue with a vendor.\u201d\n\nUnited Airlines said, also on X, that \u201csome flights are resuming\u201d as it worked to restore full operations, while Delta Airlines reported it too had resumed \u201csome flight departures.\u201d\n\nAnd Frontier Airlines said it was \u201cgradually normalising\u201d and \u201cin the process of resuming flight operations,\u201d with its ground stop now lifted.

Our ability to operate the electricity system and supply electricity remains unaffected. Our engineers have been and continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nBritish Gas, which supplies gas to homes and businesses, said it had not experienced any problems, as did rivals Octopus Energy whose spokesman said: \u201cBoth Octopus and Kraken systems have been unaffected by the Microsoft system outage.\u201d [Kraken is the software designed by Octopus and used by other energy companies for managing bills and other systems.]\n\nOfgem, the energy industry regulator, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced no IT impact as a result of the reported outage.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for National Gas, which manages much of the high pressure gas grid, said: \u201cWe are aware of the global IT issues currently affecting multiple companies. National Gas does not deploy the security software likely to be the root cause across any of its systems and is therefore not directly impacted by these events.\n\n\u201cWe remain in close contact with the wider industry and our supply chain to manage any residual impact and will continue to monitor our systems and operations closely.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for EDF, which runs the UK\u2019s nuclear power stations, said: \u201cEDF is not experiencing any direct impacts to critical business systems. We are supplying power and serving our customers as normal but will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d Nuclear sites were unaffected, it said.\n\nRWE, the German company that generates\u00a015pc of the UK\u2019s electricity via its fleet of gas-fired power stations, hydroelectric plants and several wind farms, said it was unaffected.\n\n04:09 PM BST\n\n999 calls surge amid global IT failure\n\nThe London Ambulance Service (LAS) has experienced \u201chuge increases\u201d in the number of calls to its 999 and 111 services following global IT issues.\n\nLAS chief executive Daniel Elkeles said:\n\nFollowing the global IT outage that has impacted some NHS services across the capital, our call handlers and ambulance crews are incredibly busy with huge increases in the number of calls to both our 999 and 111 services.\n\nIn fact, by 2pm today, we had received more than 3,000 999 calls and 3,000 calls to our 111 services - this is a third higher than we would usually receive in a full 24 hour period.\n\nOur teams are always here to help if you need us and we encourage anyone who needs our services to continue to contact us.\n\nWe are working very hard to make sure we are getting to patients as quickly as possible, but please be aware that our response times today may be impacted by this global issue.\n\nWe ask that people use our 999 services wisely and contact their pharmacy or visit NHS 111 online where possible. Londoners can continue to help us by only calling 999 in a serious medical emergency.\n\n04:06 PM BST\n\nPorts suffer delays from IT outage\n\nBritain\u2019s major ports revealed they have suffered delays to haulage and rail shipments as a result of the IT glitch.\n\nThe Port of Felixstowe\u00a0posted a message on its website to say it was hit by the \u201cglobal IT Crowdstrike issue\u201d at 5.40am.\n\nIt said haulage and rail operations have recommenced, and \u201cwe are working up to full capacity as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Peel Ports, which runs a number of docks around the country, told The Loadstar that the Port of Liverpool\u2019s connectivity to the a key industry messaging system \u201cwas temporarily interrupted for a couple of hours early this morning, but this was fully restored by 9.45am\u201d.

It is not easy to know what the future holds. You can\u2019t plan fully for every possible risk. But we must do what we can to learn the lessons of this period.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s first responsibility is to keep the public safe. That\u2019s a top priority for this Government with a long-term approach to strengthening our national resilience. I will lead a review of our national resilience against the range of risks that the UK faces. I\u2019ll chair a dedicated Cabinet Committee on resilience to oversee that work.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, it\u2019s not just about central Government. We will work with the devolved governments, our regional mayors and local leaders as we consider the recommendations in this report. Because when we have an emergency, we should do everything we can to work together locally and nationally.\u201d\n\n10:39 AM BST\n\nFTSE 100 slumps amid IT chaos\n\nLondon markets dropped in value after the IT failure, which has caused issues around the world for banks, supermarkets, airlines and other major institutions.\n\nThe FTSE 100 fell 0.8pc in early trading as investors were spooked by the outage potentially hitting companies\u2019 bottom lines if it goes on too long.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange said securities trading was unaffected by the outage, but its regulatory news service was not working.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said:\n\nCountless industries, from airlines and trains to banks and media, face disruption to earnings if they cannot do their job.\n\nWorkers cannot get from A to B and that will have a knock-on effect for industries across the board if staff aren\u2019t there to perform important functions or systems are offline.\n\nThe severity of the problem boils down to how long it lasts.

Falcon is what is known as an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform, which monitors the computers that it is installed on to detect intrusions - hacks - and respond to them.\n\nThat means that Falcon is a pretty privileged piece of software in that it is able to influence how the computers it is installed on behave.\n\nFor example, if it detects that a computer is infected with malware that is causing the computer to communicate with an attacker, then Falcon could conceivably block that communication from occurring. If Falcon is suffering a malfunction then it could be causing a widespread outage for two reasons - one: Falcon is widely deployed on many computers, and two: because of Falcon\u2019s privileged nature.\n\nFalcon is a bit like anti-virus software: it is regularly updated with information about the latest online threats (so it can better detect them). We have certainly seen anti-virus updates in the past causing problems. It is possible that today\u2019s outage may have been caused by a buggy update to Falcon.\n\n09:32 AM BST\n\nLuton Airport running manual systems amid outage\n\nLuton Airport said the global IT outage is affecting some airlines and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are aware of an ongoing global IT issue that is impacting check-in and boarding procedures for some airlines.\n\nWe have additional staff on hand to support and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nPassengers are advised to check with their airlines for flight updates.\n\n09:26 AM BST\n\nAir passengers left stranded amid travel chaos\n\nThe pictures of unhappy travellers are coming in thick and fast now as airlines grapple with increasing delays: Passengers are facing long queues at Gatwick after the IT outage - @sergepoliakoff Passengers waiting at Barajas Airport in Madrid - REUTERS/Elena Rodriguez Travelers at Los Angeles International Airport have been forced to sleep in a jetway for a delayed United Airlines flight hit by the IT outage - AP Photo/Stefanie Dazio\n\n09:21 AM BST\n\nPassengers given hand-written boarding passes\n\nAir passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage.\n\nHere is a shot of a ticket from low-cost airline IndiGo: Air passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage - @akothari\n\n09:19 AM BST\n\nMicrosoft 365 taking \u2018mitigation actions\u2019\n\nMicrosoft 365 say they are investigating an issue impacting users\u2019 ability to access apps and services.\n\n\u201cOur services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions,\u201d they said on X this morning.\n\n\u201cWe still expect that users will continue to see gradual relief as we continue to mitigate the issue.\u201d\n\nIt comes amid reports of widespread IT outages affecting airlines, broadcasters and banks.\n\n09:15 AM BST\n\nGP appointment booking systems down\n\nGP appointment booking systems are down following the global tech outage, the NHS has confirmed.\n\nOur health editor Laura Donnelly has the latest:\n\nHealth officials said family doctors are struggling to access systems, with some practices saying they are unable to book appointments.\n\nThe main IT system used by primary care is understood to have been hit by the problems, which have seen airports, banks and television channels knocked offline.\n\nGP surgeries hit by the outage have said the issue \u201cwill have a big effect\u201d.\n\n09:12 AM BST\n\n999 unaffected by outage\n\nPeople are still able to phone 999 in an emergency, despite the IT outage disrupting GP services.\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re not currently aware of 999 services being affected.\u201d\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \u201cNo issues that we\u2019re aware of for the Met.\u201d\n\n09:10 AM BST\n\nGatwick warns passengers \u2018may experience some delays\u2019\n\nLondon Gatwick airport has said \u201cpassengers may experience some delays\u201d due to the global outage.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are affected by the global Microsoft issues, so passengers may experience some delays while checking in and passing through security.\n\nPassengers should still arrive for their normal check-in time.\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience and are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

        "content": "What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday?\n\nARM Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) shares are trading higher after Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson upgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised its price target from $107 to $190.\n\nThe upgrade comes as the broader semiconductor sector has seen a selloff this week following Donald Trump\u2019s verbal attack against contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S.\u2019s plans to intensify advanced semiconductor sanctions against China.\n\nAI chip stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 9% and 18% this week.\n\nAt the Computex forum in Taipei, Arm CEO Rene Haas said he expects 100 billion Arm devices worldwide to be AI-ready by the end of 2025.\n\nArm Holdings plans to showcase its AI chip in 2025 and launch it commercially by fall 2025. Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm\u2019s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world\u2019s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm\u2019s major customers.\n\nArm\u2019s clients choose the company over Intel Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm\u2019s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm\u2019s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of\u00a0$112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The chief executive of CrowdStrike, the firm at the centre of the global IT outage, has said he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the incident, but warned it would take \u201csome time\u201d for systems to be fully restored.\n\nGeorge Kurtz said a fix had been deployed for a bug in an update rolled out by the cybersecurity firm which affected Microsoft Windows PCs, knocking many offline around the world, causing flight and train cancellations and crippling some healthcare systems.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Today Show in the US, Mr Kurtz said the incident was not a cyber attack, but admitted that despite CrowdStrike identifying the bug which sparked the issue and rolling out a fix, it would still be \u201csome time\u201d before all systems returned to normal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply sorry for the impact that we\u2019ve caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this,\u201d Mr Kurtz said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on with our customers all night and working with them \u2013 many of our customers are rebooting the system and it\u2019s coming up and operational because we fixed it on our end,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of the systems that aren\u2019t recovering, we\u2019re working with them, so it could be some time for some systems that just automatically won\u2019t recover, but it is our mission to make sure that every customer is fully recovered and we\u2019re not going to relent until we get every customer back to where they were and we\u2019ll continue to protect them and keep the bad guys out of their systems.\u201d\n\nAsked if he ever thought an outage of this scale was possible, the CrowdStrike founder added: \u201cSoftware is a very complex world and there\u2019s a lot of interactions, and always staying ahead of the adversary is a tall task.\u201d\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, Mr Kurtz reiterated that the outage \u201cwas not a security or cyber incident\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur customers remain fully protected,\u201d he said.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s stock tumbled in value when the US markets opened on Friday as investors digested the impact of the outage. Shares slid by over 8% at the start of trading, knocking around 10 billion US dollars (\u00a37.8 billion) off its market value. The largest financial markets in the US and UK fell during the trading session as other companies were also affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday was not a security or cyber incident. Our customers remain fully protected.\n\nWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can\u2026\n\n\u2014 George Kurtz (@George_Kurtz) July 19, 2024\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored.\n\n\u201cThe fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux \u2013 and so this could have been much worse.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been impacted by the bug.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\nThe NHS is aware of a global IT outage and an issue with a GP appointment and patient record system.\n\nIf you have an appointment please do attend unless you are told otherwise. If you need help use 111 online or by phone and in an emergency call 999.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/M4QxHP2GqM\n\n\u2014 NHS England (@NHSEngland) July 19, 2024\n\nThe outage is \u201ccausing disruption in the majority of GP practices\u201d, NHS England said, and ambulance services also reported increases in calls from patients who are unable to contact other NHS providers because of the IT issues.\n\nThe health service said patients should attend appointments unless told otherwise and should only contact their GP in urgent cases.\n\nAcross England, GP surgeries reported being unable to book appointments or access patient records as their EMIS Web system went down.\n\nThe National Pharmacy Association said \u201cservices in community pharmacies, including the accessing of prescriptions from GPs and medicine deliveries, are disrupted today\u201d. Outages have affected flights (Jacob King/PA)\n\nIn an update on its website, Microsoft suggested users of virtual machines \u2013 a PC where the computer is not in the same place as the screen \u2013 turn their devices on and off again up to 15 times to help reboot the device and fix the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d the tech giant said.\n\nIn the UK, Sky News briefly went off air on Friday morning and Britain\u2019s biggest train company warned passengers to expect disruption because of \u201cwidespread IT issues\u201d, as did many major airlines and airports.\n\nAround the world, banks, supermarkets and other major institutions reported computer issues disrupting services, while many businesses were unable to take digital payments or access key databases. Sky News was knocked off air (Sky News/PA)\n\nAt airports, flights were cancelled and staff forced to check in passengers manually on specific flights to help ease long queues.\n\nAnd one impacted airline, Ryanair, urged passengers whose flights have been cancelled to leave the airport.\n\nThe airline said in a statement: \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve been forced to cancel a small number of flights today due to this global third-party IT outage.\n\n\u201cAffected passengers have been notified and are advised to log into their myRyanair account once systems are back online to see their options.\n\n\u201cA full list of cancellations is available at ryanair.com. If your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this global third-party IT outage, and we are working hard to minimise disruption and keep passengers informed.\u201d\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f We are currently experiencing widespread IT issues across our entire network. Our IT teams are actively investigating to determine the root cause of the problem.\n\nWe are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, leading to potential short-notice cancellations,\u2026\n\n\u2014 Thameslink (@TLRailUK) July 19, 2024\n\nEarlier in the day, Govia Thameslink Railway \u2013 parent company of Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Northern \u2013 warned passengers to expect delays.\n\nGP practices across England warned they could not access EMIS Web,\u00a0the most widely used clinical system for primary care in the UK.\n\nIt enables GP practices to book appointments and examine records, and includes a clinical decision support tool as well as helping with admin.\n\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, the founding chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the incident was an \u201cincredibly powerful illustration of our global digital vulnerabilities and the fragility of core Internet infrastructure.\u201d\n\nProf Martin, who now works at the University of Oxford, said it was hard to estimate how long it would take to recover from the outage.\n\n\u201cThe underlying problem is fixed and the fixes are being implemented. Some industries can recovery quickly. But others like aviation will have long backlogs. That said, I\u2019d be surprised if we were still facing serious problems this time next week.\u201d\n\nHe added that the cyber industry also needed to \u201cget better\u201d at \u201cfinding and fixing these single points of failure across all core digital infrastructure\u201d and \u201cmanaging how we cope when IT services fall over\u201d, saying the world faced \u201cmore of these types of events\u201d if changes were not made.",

Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz posted on X on Friday that the fault had been identified and \u201ca fix has been deployed,\u201d adding that it wasn\u2019t a cyberattack. Compounding the issue, Microsoft also reported an apparently unrelated problem with its Azure cloud service.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Software Outage: Live Updates\n\nHitting airlines, banks and healthcare systems, there have been few outages of this scale. The cascading failures underscore vulnerabilities of the modern economy and the central role of security software, which has deep access to operating systems.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThe economic impact is going to be huge.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the disruption reflects the enduring ubiquity of Microsoft\u2019s Windows, and the sizeable adoption of CrowdStrike\u2019s security software. Windows is installed on more than 70% of machines, according to StatCounter, and CrowdStrike is the global leader in modern corporate protection software, according to estimates by research firm IDC.\n\nAlthough its software is designed to thwart threats, CrowdStrike customers posted blue error screens to social media as they were prevented from accessing laptops and corporate computers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc., and the LSE Group were among the major companies to disclose issues from communications to customer service. Airports from Singapore to Zurich were impacted. The New York subway said arrival information is unavailable for most of its lines, but services are operating. Bloomberg terminals were operating as normal.\n\nClick here for a liveblog on the outages.\n\nMicrosoft said it was \u201caware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform.\u201d The company said it fixed a separate glitch affecting Microsoft 365 apps.\n\nThe outages weighed on several sectors, including airlines, insurers and stock exchange operators. Shares in CrowdStrike sank 20%, while Microsoft fell 2.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPast disruptions have been less severe. In 2017, a series of errors within Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud service affected the operation of tens of thousands of websites. In 2021, issues at content delivery network Fastly took out several media networks including Bloomberg News and there were separate disruptions at Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history,\u201d Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant and creator of the hack-checking website Have I Been Pwned, said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nThe first glitches emerged in the US late on Thursday and were blamed on the failure of Microsoft services Azure and 365, the company\u2019s internet-based office software suite.\n\nProblems linked to CrowdStrike then surfaced hours later in Asia and rippled across systems in Europe. As the US commute got underway, the New York subway said arrival information was unavailable but trains and buses were still running.\n\n--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi, Shona Ghosh, Kati Pohjanpalo, Celeste Perri and Danny Lee.\n\n(Updates throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Behind a massive IT failure that grounded flights, upended markets and disrupted corporations around the world is one cybersecurity company: CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGlobal IT Crash That Blocked 911 Calls and Grounded Planes Eases Zuckerberg Calls Trump\u2019s Response to Shooting \u2018Badass\u2019 Airlines Start Digging Themselves Out of Epic Flight Disruptions Canada\u2019s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can\u2019t All Stay Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO\n\nKnown as a dominant supplier of software that protects businesses from ransomware attacks, CrowdStrike was thrust into the spotlight on Friday as it struggled to fix a faulty patch that led to cascading, system-wide failures, paralyzing the operations of clients ranging from banks to global retail giants to health-care systems.\n\nWall Street\u2019s reaction to CrowdStrike\u2019s monumental gaffe was swift: Its shares tanked as much as 15% in New York trading on Friday, wiping out almost $8 billion of its market value. The company is still worth nearly $80 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike was founded by former executives of antivirus pioneer McAfee Inc. and launched in 2012. It has grown into the leading maker of a relatively new type of security software that\u2019s considered among the best defenses against ransomware and other hacking threats. It controls about 18% of the $8.6 billion global market for so-called \u201cmodern\u201d endpoint protection software, just ahead of archrival Microsoft Corp., according to market research firm IDC.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has bucked the broader trend in cybersecurity, with the firm reporting blockbuster earnings in its most recent quarter. Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz used the opportunity to take potshots at its larger rival, saying in June that CrowdStrike\u2019s technology \u201ccreates a wide competitive moat\u201d in the cyber sector, where Microsoft has $20 billion in annual revenue. After a US Department of Homeland Security report faulted Microsoft security failings, Kurtz said CrowdStrike had received an \u201coutpouring of requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base,\u201d he said.\n\nThe type of software CrowdStrike supplies is separate and distinct from older, more limited types of security software. Traditional antivirus software was useful in the early days of computing and the internet for their ability to hunt for signs of known malware, but it has fallen out of favor as attacks have become more sophisticated. Now, products known as \u201cendpoint detection and response\u201d software that CrowdStrike develops do far more, continually scanning machines for any signs of suspicious activities and automating a response.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut to do this, these programs have to be given access to inspect the very core of the computers\u2019 operating systems for security defects. This access gives them the ability to disrupt the very systems they are trying to protect. And it is how Microsoft\u2019s Windows systems came into play in Friday\u2019s outage.\n\nRepresentatives of Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike confirmed online reports that a glitchy update was responsible for disabling potentially millions of corporate and government Windows computers around the world and causing the dreaded \u201cblue screen of death.\u201d\n\nThe company pegged the incident to \u201ca defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\u201d in a statement on Friday and said the outage wasn\u2019t down to a cyberattack or security breach. Anyone using a Mac or Linux machine isn\u2019t impacted, the company said, adding that \u201ca fix has been deployed.\u201d\n\nTo add to the confusion, an apparently separate incident involving Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud services also caused disruption on Friday. In a status update, Microsoft said it had fixed the underlying issue but that users would continue to experience \u201cresidual impact.\u201d\n\nWhile cybersecurity professionals say CrowdStrike\u2019s technology is a strong way to defend against ransomware, its cost \u2014 which in some cases can be more than $50 per machine \u2014 means that most organizations don\u2019t install it on all of their computers. What that means, however, is that the computers that have the software installed on them are among the most important to protect, and if they go down, key services can fall with them.\n\nNow that CrowdStrike\u2019s fix is out, any Windows desktop or laptop machine with the CrowdStrike product affected by the initial flawed update will need to be updated.\n\nHow laborious that process is will depend on whether CrowdStrike can roll out the fix automatically, or whether every machine will need to be manually rebooted. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, CrowdStrike\u2019s Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said the company was looking for ways to automate the steps involved, suggesting at least some customers are stuck with manual fixes for now. The company also has addressed the software update at the root of the issue, Kurtz said.\n\n\u201cIt was a content bug, or update, that we sent out and we\u2019ve identified, and that we\u2019ve rolled back,\u201d Kurtz said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He apologized to affected customers, and said some systems would take a few hours to come back online while others would take longer.\n\nThat means affected entities - from banks to bourses to shipping ports - might take days to fully come back online, according to Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey.\n\n\u201cTo use the laptops, they\u2019ll have to manually intervene \u2014 that is a big job,\u201d Woodward said in an earlier interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how the bad rollout happened to begin with.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is meant to keep these machines safe,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cThis is the sort of thing ransomware would do, but imagine ransomware simultaneously hitting the biggest organizations in the world \u2014 container ports in the Baltics, hospitals, railway stations, they\u2019ve all been hit at once because of this one little file.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s customer base comprises large organizations that have a large number of remote machines to manage, he said. \u201cThe economic impact is going to be huge.\u201d\n\n(Updates with additional context in third, fourth, fifth and fourteenth paragraphs.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Much of the world faced online disarray Friday as a widespread technology outage affected companies and services across industries \u2014 grounding flights, knocking banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide. The company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, and that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\nCrowdStrike has said a fix is on the way. Still, disarray continued hours after the problem was first detected.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow did Friday's global outage happen?\n\nFriday's chaos began with a faulty update was pushed out from CrowdStrike. In a Friday post on social media platform X, President and CEO George Kurtz cited a \u201cdefect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\u201d \u2014 noting that Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted.\n\nBut, because scores of companies rely on CrowdStrike for their security needs with Windows as their operating system, the consequences of this kind of technical problem are far-reaching.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services during peak summer travel. Banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages impacting payments and online services. And hospitals had problems with their appointment systems, while officials in some U.S. states warned of 911 problems in their areas.\n\nDownDectector, which tracks user-reported disruptions to internet services, recorded that airlines, payment platforms and online shopping websites across the world were affected \u2014 although the disruption appeared piecemeal and was apparently related to whether the companies used Microsoft cloud-based services.\n\nStill, experts stress that Friday\u2019s disruptions underscore the vulnerability of worldwide dependence on software that comes from only a handful of providers.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world\u2019s core internet infrastructure,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, a professor at Oxford University\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government and former Head of Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a U.S. cybersecurity company that provides software to companies around the world and across industries. It bills itself as being the globe's most advanced cloud-based security technology provider.\n\n\u201cWe stop breaches,\u201d the cybersecurity firm writes on its website.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the company's website, CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and launched in early 2012. CrowdStrike listed on the Nasdaq exchange five years ago. Last month, the Austin, Texas company reported that its revenue rose 33% in the last quarter from the same quarter a year earlier \u2014 logging a net profit of $42.8 million, up from $491,000 in the first quarter of last year.\n\nCrowdStrike has a partnership with Amazon Web Services and its \u201cFalcon for Defender\u201d security technology is designed to supplement Microsoft Defender to prevent attacks.\n\nIs there a fix?\n\nDisruptions on Friday have continued hours after CrowdStrike first identified the issue. But both the company and Microsoft say that they're working to get systems back online.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Crowdstrike said that it was \u201cactively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" \u2014 adding that a fix \u201chad been deployed\u201d for the identified issue.\n\nMicrosoft 365 posted on social media platform X that the company was \u201cworking on rerouting the impacted traffic to alternate systems to alleviate impact\u201d and that they were \u201cobserving a positive trend in service availability.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson Frank X. Shaw added in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cactively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\u201d Both CrowdStrike and Microsoft are also appearing to engage IT personnel on official online channels, such as Reddit.",

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Sanctioned Russia emerges unscathed in global IT outage",
        "content": "By Gleb Stolyarov\n\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian officials boasted on Friday that Moscow was spared the impact of the global IT systems outage because of its increased self-sufficiency after years of Western sanctions, though some experts said Russian systems could still be vulnerable.\n\nMicrosoft and other IT firms have suspended sales of new products in Russia and have been scaling down their operations in line with sanctions imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a special military operation.\n\nCrowdStrike, a U.S. cybersecurity company whose widely used \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash, had no known customers in Russia. The Russian market is dominated by local cybersecurity firms such as Kaspersky Labs.\n\n\"CrowdStrike has not provided any services in Russia, since February 2022 for sure,\" Mikhail Klimarev from the non-governmental Internet Protection Society told Reuters.\n\nThe Kremlin, along with companies from state nuclear giant Rosatom, which operates all of Russia's nuclear plants, to major lenders and airlines, reported no glitches amid the outage that affected international companies across the globe.\n\n\"The situation once again highlights the significance of foreign software substitution,\" Russia's digital development ministry said.\n\nRussian financial and currency markets also ran smoothly.\n\n\"Everyone has long been preparing for the possibility of being cut off from Microsoft due to sanctions. The current incident is a test of how well we have prepared. So far, everything is fine, at least for the major players, and generally, there is no panic in the market,\" one currency trader, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters.\n\nRussia's second-largest lender, VTB, announced plans to increase the share of domestically developed software to 95% by the end of this year, up from 85% currently. The bank said it invested 50 billion roubles ($571.46 million) this year alone in phasing out foreign software.\n\nHowever, IT expert Eldar Murtazin said the risks posed by insufficient testing of new software updates were universal, and Russian software was not necessarily immune to future glitches like the one that hit CrowdStrike.\n\n\"Such issues can happen to any software, whether Russian or non-Russian, if there are no proper controls over new releases. If such an outage had occurred 3-4 years ago, a number of Russian companies would have been affected,\" Murtazin told Reuters.\n\n($1 = 87.4955 roubles)\n\n(Reporting by Gleb Stolyarov; Writing by Gleb Bryanski; Editing by Peter Graff)",

        "title": "The Most Liveable Country in Asia in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024 and in this article, we will talk about the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, we are well aware of the consequences of climate change and hence, one of the most concerning factors that affect livability of a city is extreme heat as it increases discomfort and potentially also increases crime and traffic accidents, particularly in high humidity areas. Speaking of discomfort, the livability of cities in East Asia today is facing challenges due to extreme urban heat. In 2023, record-high temperatures exacerbated by climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effect posed serious risks. On average, land surface temperatures in East Asian cities were 2.0\u00b0C warmer than nearby rural areas, with cities in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines experiencing up to 6.6\u00b0C higher temperatures. This disparity was particularly pronounced in poorer neighborhoods and is more severe at night due to heat retention by urban infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, according to the World Bank, over 100,000 deaths in East Asia are attributed to extreme heat annually. Economically, productivity losses from the UHI effect combined with global warming could reduce the GDP of major cities by 1.4-1.7% by 2050, with worst-case scenarios projecting an 11% loss by century's end. Speaking of GDP, let\u2019s look at the economic strength of Asia in general.\n\nThe Economic Strength of Asia in 2024\n\nIn 2024, Asia's economic growth is being fueled by tremendous developments in trade interconnectivity and technological innovation. Ccountries like India, China, and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are essentially leading this transformation. For example, we know that India's economy is expected to grow at 6.8% this year and its GDP is projected to surpass Japan's by 2025 and Germany's by 2030 and will eventually reach $7 trillion. On the other hand, China, despite a potential slowdown, is still projected to have a GDP $5 trillion higher in 2030 compared to 2022. Moreover, ASEAN's trade is anticipated to grow by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with exports increasing by nearly 90% by 2031.\n\nIt is also true that Asia's rise as a global tech and innovation hub is another important driver. The continent is becoming increasingly interconnected as manufacturing and sourcing are shifting to Southeast Asia with incredibly support provided by agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). By 2030, Asia\u2019s fintech revenues are expected to outpace those of North America. It is also worth highlighting that the region's consumers show a strong inclination toward artificial intelligence which also suggests near-term growth opportunities in tech sectors. Let\u2019s look at the recent developments of tech initiatives around Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Growing Focus of the Big Giants in Asia\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has recently announced a major initiative to equip 2.5 million people in ASEAN countries with AI skills by 2025 to support the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025. The initiative aims to build an AI-ready talent pool across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam and will involve partnerships with governments, nonprofit and corporate organizations. Over the past two years, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Skills4Jobs program has already reached 1.7 million participants in the region. The AI TEACH programs by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in Indonesia and Malaysia target vocational students, while Thailand's AI Skills for the AI-enabled Tourism Industry program aims to train 100,000 young entrepreneurs. Additionally, in the Philippines, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to equip 1 million K-12 students with AI and cybersecurity skills.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) has also intensified its focus on social impact, particularly in the field of education and skill development for the region. In 2022, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 pledged to train 1 million women and girls in the Asia-Pacific region over five years as part of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Upskilling Initiative. This initiative was aimed at closing the gender gap in STEM fields and has already empowered nearly 650,000 women and girls through different educational programs. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 partnerships across the region, including collaborations with educational departments and organizations in Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, are central to this effort. The Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024\n\nIngus Kruklitis/Shutterstock.com\n\nIs the United Arab Emirates the Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024?\n\nIn order to identify the most livable countries in Asia in 2024, we utilized country ranking from the Human Development Index for the year 2022 and from the Numbeo\u2019s affordability index by Asian countries for the year 2023. We averaged the Asian countries\u2019 rankings for both these metrics and obtained an average rank to rank our list. The list is now presented in a descending order. Our methodology revealed that the UAE is indeed the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nThere are multiple major reasons that make the UAE such a preferred destination. First of all, the country has a tax-free income policy which is a major draw that allows residents to keep their entire earnings. This financial freedom is complemented by a stable economy diversified beyond oil which offers job opportunities across different sectors. Safety is another major factor as Dubai has one of the lowest crime rates globally.\n\nThe UAE has a population nearing 10 million which is predominantly composed of expatriates as the country provides a favorable standard of living. Economically, the UAE has rapidly evolved into one of the world's wealthiest countries within a span of just 50 years. With a high GDP per capita, driven largely by its oil reserves and strategic economic diversification efforts, the UAE has achieved impressive growth rates, averaging close to 4% annually since 2000.\n\nTo check out the extensive list of the most livable countries in Asia, please visit 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best MBA programs; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Best-Performing Sector of the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The real estate sector has been one of the worst-performing parts of the stock market recently. Although the S&P 500 is up by 50% since the start of 2023, rebounding nicely from the 2022 bear market lows, the real estate sector, as indicated by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ), is up by just 6% in the same period. Even including dividends, real estate has underperformed the S&P 500 by 37 percentage points over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile this has certainly not been a fun time to be a real estate investment trust (REIT) investor, there's good reason to believe that things are about to turn around. With that in mind, here's why real estate has performed so poorly as a sector, why things might be about to get better for REITs, and why now could be a great time to get some exposure.\n\nWhy has the real estate sector performed so poorly?\n\nThe biggest reason real estate has underperformed is the rising-rate environment of the past couple years.\n\nWithout getting too deep into an economics lesson, the key point to know is that when risk-free interest rates rise (Treasury securities, for example), it tends to put pressure on income-oriented investments like REITs. Think of it this way: When instruments like Treasuries pay more, the yields investors expect from \"riskier\" investments tend to rise as well. Since yield and price have an inverse relationship, rising yields put downward pressure on REIT prices, even when the underlying business is doing well.\n\nNot only do rising rates generally put pressure on income-focused investments, but they also make it more expensive to borrow money. While this can affect businesses in all sectors, REITs tend to be more reliant than most on debt to grow their business, similar to how most homeowners use a mortgage when buying a home.\n\nIt also hasn't helped that the surge in AI investment has caused investor sentiment to shift in favor of massive tech stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). We've already started to see some money rotate out of the high-flying AI winners and into income-based stocks like REITs just based on recent inflation data, and this could accelerate once the Federal Reserve actually starts to cut rates.\n\nLast but certainly not least, we've seen some headwinds specific to certain property types. One big example is the communications REITs: American Tower(NYSE: AMT) and Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI). Both are experiencing a challenging growth environment, and since they're both among the largest REITs, they have a disproportionate drag on the index. Plus, some sectors have dealt with oversupply headwinds, such as office and self-storage real estate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould a major turnaround be right around the corner?\n\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't raised interest rates in 2024, but investor expectations have certainly changed. At the beginning of the year, the median expectation was for a total of six rate cuts in 2024, but the inflation data and Fed officials quickly told a different story. And that's the biggest reason why real estate has underperformed so far this year.\n\nHowever, the latest inflation data indicates that it might actually be time for the Fed to start seriously considering rate cuts. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the first rate cut is clearly expected in September, a total of three are expected by the end of the year, and the median expectation is now for six total cuts by July 2025. In other words, the falling-rate cycle is set to begin -- just a little later than originally anticipated.\n\nAs rates fall, investor money could start to flow out of risk-free instruments like Treasuries, money market funds, and savings accounts, and into high-yielding stocks like REITs. And if the recent market activity is any indicator, we could also see a bit of a rotation out of the high-flying megacap tech stocks that have largely led the market's performance.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but...\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there's no way to know for sure how REITs will perform for the rest of 2024 and beyond, or if the Fed will actually start cutting interest rates. If inflation data for the next few months doesn't look great, it's entirely possible rates could stay higher for longer than expected.\n\nHaving said that, investing in REITs when the real estate sector is down by 25% from its all-time high, as it is now, has historically been a very strong entry point for long-term investors. There are some excellent values in individual REITs right now, but if you'd rather get broad exposure to the sector to hold for the long run, an ETF like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF could be a fantastic addition to your long-term portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Real Estate ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Real Estate ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard Real Estate ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Netflix, Trump nomination, outages - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Netflix will be in the spotlight Friday, after the streaming giant beat expectations of net subscriber additions but issued a cautious revenue guidance. Donald Trump accepted the Republican Party presidential nomination, while Wall Street looks set to end the week lower with a sectorial rotation under way.\n\n1. Netflix net adds ahead, revenue guidance cautious\n\nNetflix\u2019s third-quarter revenue guidance fell short of expectations, even as the streaming giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid blowout subscriber additions, driven by a strong content slate and an ongoing crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe mixed nature of these results, released after the market close Thursday, has resulted in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock trading largely unchanged premarket Friday. The stock has surged nearly a third so far this year.\n\nNetflix reported second-quarter earnings of $4.88 a share on revenue of $9.56 billion, topping estimates of $4.74 on revenue of $9.53 billion.\n\nThe streaming giant also raked in 8 million additional users in the quarter, well above the 4.8 million estimated, but below the 9.3 million seen in the previous three months.\n\nThe company had guided for lower net subscriber additions in the second quarter as it is facing saturation in the United States and plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year.\n\nOn the flip side, the company guided for third-quarter revenue of $9.37 billion, missing estimates of $9.81 billion, and said its advertising business would not become a primary driver of revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nInvestors have been looking at the company's relatively new advertising business as a potential source of growth.\n\n2. Futures slip amid a weekly rotation\n\nU.S. stock futures slipped lower Friday, continuing the previous session\u2019s weakness as the quarterly earnings season marches on.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 75 points, or 0.2%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 9 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 60 points, or 0.3%.\n\nAll three major indices fell on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 500 points, ending a six-day winning run.\n\nLooking at the week as a whole, a market rotation appears to be taking place, with the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite down almost 3% and the S&P 500 1.3% lower, while the DJIA is up 1.7%.\n\nThe earnings continue to flow Friday, with results due from the likes of American Express (NYSE:AXP), Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) before the opening bell.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will also have comments from Fed policymakers John Williams and Raphael Bostic to digest for clues about the future path of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n3. Trump accepts nomination as Biden doubts rise\n\nDonald Trump formally accepted his nomination as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidate at the Republican National Congress in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Thursday.\n\nHis nomination as the GOP candidate now sets him up for a potential rematch with President Joe Biden, who had beaten Trump in the 2020 elections.\n\nTrump was seen gaining a large boost in popularity after the assassination attempt last week.\n\nIn contrast, Biden was facing growing calls from the Democratic party members and donors to pull out of the presidential race after his weak performance in last month\u2019s debate with Trump.\n\nCritics of Biden have argued that his advanced age and tenuous health make him unfit to run for a second term.\n\nBiden is likely to drop his bid for reelection, TD analysts said in a note, adding that the Republican party had now realigned around Trump, and the Democrats could potentially lose the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhile the decision ultimately rests with Biden, we see him dropping his re-election bid as a question of when, not if,\u201d TD said.\n\n\u201cShould Trump win in a GOP sweep (House&Senate), we suspect he would read that as a MAGA mandate for his American First policies\u2026 we expect (a) potential 2nd Term to be all gas, no brake.\u201d\n\n4. Crowdstrike, Microsoft suffers major outages\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has suffered a major outage on Friday, affecting business all around the world, and tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also experienced an outage, resulting in at least two low-cost U.S. airlines grounding flights.\n\nCrowdstrike said its outage resulted from an issue with the latest update, and the company is now in the process of rolling back that update globally.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor,\u201d the company said in a recorded message.\n\nMicrosoft reported an outage in its Azure cloud computing platform late-Thursday, with a note on the company\u2019s website attributing the Azure outage to a \u201cconfiguration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s service health status website showed its 365 service was also experiencing \u201cdegradation,\u201d and that users will be unable to access several Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n5. Crude heads for weekly loss\n\nCrude prices fell Friday, heading for a weekly loss as a strong dollar and concerns about Chinese economic weakness weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.5% to $80.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $84.89 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks are set for minor losses this week, their second consecutive losing week, after the dollar strengthened for the second consecutive session, hitting demand for dollar-denominated oil from investors holding other currencies.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, remained front and center, following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThe readings came after data last week showed a decline in China\u2019s oil imports in June.\n\nLimiting the week\u2019s losses this week has been the U.S. government reporting a bigger-than-expected weekly decline in oil stockpiles, suggesting consistent demand during the summer driving season.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNetflix, Trump nomination, outages - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean stocks slip, global IT outage causes chaos\n\nNeutral rate cannot determine monetary policy in India, says cenbank chief",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Friday amid persistent concerns over a renewed trade war between the U.S. and China, while positive earnings from TSMC did little to stop a rout in technology stocks.\n\nRegional markets took negative cues from their U.S. peers, as an extended rotation out of technology stocks sparked overnight losses on Wall Street. U.S. stock benchmarks tumbled from record highs over the past three sessions.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose mildly in Asian trade, as a rout on Wall Street appeared to be somewhat easing. Focus also turned to a slew of key U.S. earnings due in the coming days, with majors including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) set to report.\n\nChinese stocks down on US trade jitters; stimulus hopes dampen losses\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell slightly on Friday, although they were trading above intraday lows.\n\nMedia reports this week suggested that the U.S. was considering stricter trade restrictions against China, especially the country\u2019s technology and chipmaking sectors.\n\nThe reports ramped up concerns over a renewed trade war between Beijing and Washington, given that trade relations between the two are already strained.\n\nSpeculation over a second Donald Trump presidency also dented Chinese stocks, given that Trump has maintained a largely negative rhetoric against Beijing.\n\nStill, losses in Chinese stocks were dampened by promises of more supportive policy from the Chinese government, as the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party carried on.\n\nTech rout persists, TSMC offers little support to chipmakers\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia, as the sector continued to grapple with profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a broad pivot into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nLosses in tech dragged Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 down 0.4%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index slid over 2%.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI shed 1.5% on losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nChipmaking stocks slid even as industry major TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) clocked stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, and upgraded its outlook on the prospect of strong demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm\u2019s Taipei shares fell 2%, as sentiment towards Taiwan was also rattled by comments from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump, who said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nBroader Asian stocks fell as sentiment remained dour. Concerns over China saw Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index slide 1.1%, with local stocks also seeing profit-taking after racing to record highs earlier in the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan\u2019s TOPIX fell 0.6%, as softer-than-expected consumer price index data raised questions over whether the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates soon.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, as the index neared a record-high 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as US-China jitters persist; TSMC sparks little cheer\n\nTSMC shares fall nearly 2% even after raising 2024 revenue forecast\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited",

Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,985.0 points.\n\nTech stocks steady after bruising losses\n\nMajor technology stocks steadied in aftermarket trading, after clocking steep losses over the past two sessions. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country\u2019s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.7% to 17,874.45 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.3% to 17,874.45 points.\n\nHeavyweight tech earnings on tap, TSMC supports chipmakers\n\nFocus was now squarely on key upcoming earnings from the tech sector next week. Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday. TSMC rose slightly after it clocked stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker also hiking its outlook on strong AI-fueled demand.\n\nPolitical wrangling in focus as calls grow for Biden to exit race\n\nThe 2024 presidential race was also a point of focus for Wall Street, amid growing calls from members of the Democratic party for Biden to not seek re-election.\n\nReports on Thursday said former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House democrats that Biden could be persuaded to exit the race.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s health, coupled with the increasing popularity of Republican nominee Donald Trump, have sparked doubts over whether Biden will be able to clinch a second term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited\n\nEmbraer deliveries rise 88% in second quarter, order backlog at 7-year high\n\nFired Citigroup banker says COO intended to deceive regulator on bank's metrics\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Smartsheet Inc (NYSE:SMAR), the US-based creator of workplace collaboration software valued at $6.3 billion, lifted 5.5% during Thursday's regular session after reports that the company has engaged investment banking consultants following acquisition overtures from private equity firms, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Bellevue, Washington-based company is collaborating with Qatalyst Partners to evaluate propositions from private equity entities, according to these sources. Smartsheet has not yet determined if it will initiate a sale process, and it may choose to remain independent, they added.\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the situation. Both Smartsheet and Qatalyst declined to comment.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been aggressively seeking deals in industries such as technology and services this year, following a period of inactivity for most of 2023 due to high interest rates that made leveraged buyouts more difficult to finance. The first half of the year saw a 41% jump in private equity deal volumes, propelled by several take-private deals.\n\nSmartsheet's software provides organizations with a single platform to manage, monitor, and automate their workflows, offering a broader range of features and capabilities than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Excel. The company caters primarily to large corporate clients with complex operations, such as Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and services 85% of Fortune 500 companies, as per its website. Smartsheet's competitors, including Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN) and Monday .Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY), generally target smaller businesses.\n\nSmartsheet prioritizes growth over immediate profitability, achieving robust sales while incurring losses. However, the company has been progressively reducing these losses, improving its profit margins in the process.\n\nIn the fiscal year ending January 31, the company reported a revenue of $904 million, a significant increase from $714 million the previous year, and managed to cut its pre-tax losses from $213 million to $96 million. As of the end of April, the company had $334 million in cash reserves and no debt.\n\nBanks are typically hesitant to lend to companies that consume their cash flow, which can make leveraged buyouts more difficult for private equity firms to finance. As a workaround, some private equity firms have sought financing from so-called shadow banks, investment firms that operate outside the traditional banking sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese lenders are not subject to banking regulatory oversight and can provide loans based less on a company's cash flow and more on its generated sales, often referred to as an annual recurring revenue loan.\n\nHowever, this type of debt carries inherent risks. For instance, private equity firm Vista Equity is reportedly in discussions to relinquish control of its educational software platform, Pluralsight (NASDAQ:PS), to its lenders following a souring of the annual recurring revenue loan it took on after its $3.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSmartsheet spikes as company considers buyout offers - Reuters\n\nAfter-hours movers: Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, and more\n\nSelective Insurance shares fall 7% after reporting Q2 loss",

These are some of the best known, and most popular, companies.\n\nAll eyes will be on these five for a variety of reasons. Several are part of the Magnificent 7. Many investors own those 7 large cap stocks. But several others are simply popular growth stocks that have hit new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nQ2\u2019s Must-See Earnings Reports\n\nWhat will they say about the US, and global, economies? Is the recession here or will the Fed achieve a soft landing?\n\nSeveral companies are booming thanks to the AI revolution. Will AI still be a driver of earnings and sales in Q2?\n\nWhile there are a lot of companies that people will be tuning into during this earnings season, these 5 are the most important of all. You won\u2019t want to miss them.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Stocks to Watch During Q2 Earnings Season\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surprised on earnings 5 quarters in a row. In fact, it has a great earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years and that was in early 2023.\n\nApple shares are up 19% year-to-date and are hitting all-time highs. Yet Apple trades at 35x forward earnings. Is Apple too hot to handle?\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) has beat 4 quarters in a row. That is a turnaround from a string of misses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEli Lilly has been one of the hottest stocks on the Street. It is up 55.4% year-to-date. Eli Lilly is trading with a high valuation, as it has a forward P/E of 70. Will Eli Lilly continue to execute?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. It also has a solid 5-year earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses during that time. That is impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of Chipotle are up 21% year-to-date and hit new all-time highs. However, Chipotle isn\u2019t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 51. Can Chipotle continue with the 20%+ earnings growth this quarter?\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has a great earnings surprise record. Microsoft has beat 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2022.\n\nMicrosoft shares hit new all-time highs in 2024. It is up 18% year-to-date. Microsoft isn\u2019t cheap, however. It trades at 34x forward earnings. Will AI prove to be another catalyst for Microsoft in Q2?\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has an excellent earnings surprise track record. It\u2019s beat 4 quarters in a row. Super Micro Computer has only missed once since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have been red-hot in 2024, gaining 187% year-to-date on the AI trade. It reports earnings in Aug 2024. Super Micro is trading at 26x. Is Super Micro Computer a good bellwether of what\u2019s to come with the other AI stocks this earnings season?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Microsoft's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership Insiders have been selling lately\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$169b last week. However, the 26% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Microsoft. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Microsoft\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Microsoft has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Affordable Cloud Stocks to Watch in July",
        "content": "Believe it or not, quite a few cloud stocks out there don\u2019t cost a small fortune to punch your ticket to. Several enterprise and consumer cloud companies haven\u2019t yet felt the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) tailwind all too strongly, especially versus the likes of your average semiconductor heavyweight. And it\u2019s unclear if they will anytime soon, with infrastructure software spending markedly softer than hardware spend.\n\nAs top hardware companies become fully priced, investors looking for \u201cdeals\u201d in the gen AI universe may wish to check in with some fairly-priced cloud before the herd catches on.\n\nUndoubtedly, we could see IT investing turn from hardware to software once firms have had their fill of chips. Indeed, stockpiling GPUs, memory, servers, and other related hardware represents only one piece of the AI puzzle for firms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough the timing of AI-induced earnings surges seems somewhat less certain for many cloud stocks, they could have the potential to be sudden and sizable in magnitude. Here are three names that look intriguing this July.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a cloud darling that\u2019s fully invested in gen AI. Though there are formidable and fast-moving rivals in the AI image and video generation market, Adobe has excellent managers who can lead it into the AI age. Indeed, Adobe\u2019s move into the cloud has paid off big time. And so, too, should its deep dive into the AI waters.\n\nWith AI integration, Adobe stands to enable the masses to be pro-level creators. Indeed, only so many people know how to use Photoshop well. However, with gen AI taking care of the tedious details while allowing users to fine-tune their creations, the firm stands to expand upon its total addressable market significantly.\n\nIn essence, anyone who can type into a prompt can have the capability of a designer when equipped with AI, which will become even more intelligent as time goes on.\n\nGiven how Adobe is leveraging AI software, I view ADBE stock as a cheap cloud stock while going for 30.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). Shares are up around 29% from their early-June lows and could be headed much higher if it executes its AI plans.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is another cloud-based AI software firm that can profoundly boost user productivity. The Australian company behind industry-leading project management software can create much incremental value by rolling out AI across its application suite.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow down more than 60% from its 2021 all-time high, TEAM stock looks like one of the cheaper cloud stocks for investors seeking AI innovation and growth at a reasonable price. Of course, there are notable headwinds, but I think they mostly distract from the longer-term opportunity in cloud migration and gen AI.\n\nEarlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Rob Owens upgraded TEAM stock to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d and raised his price target by 12.5% ($200 to $225). He views a \u201cfavorable\u201d risk-reward at current valuations. At 55.5 times forward P/E, the stock is no steal. However, if management can hit its new financial goals, the beaten-down cloud stock may be one of the best opportunities in tech.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) made headlines this past week when it announced it\u2019s close to inking a $23 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz. In light of the massive breach at AT&T (NYSE:T), investors seem to welcome such a deal.\n\nUndoubtedly, GOOG stock has been on an incredible run in the past year, but the cloud stock\u2019s rally may be in its earlier innings. As the cloud firm beefs up its cybersecurity prowess via the Wiz acquisition and its own innovations, Google\u2019s cloud customers can feel safe knowing their data is in excellent hands.\n\nAdditionally, as Google advances its AI strategy in the cloud, Alphabet may just be able to rise in the standings of the public cloud race. Indeed, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure is leading the charge with its AI prowess. But Google Cloud certainly has the AI chops to pick up the pace. At just 28.4 times forward P/E, GOOG stock reeks of relative value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in GOOG and MSFT.

        "title": "2 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Stocks that can survive and thrive for long periods -- say, beyond 20 years -- are a special breed. These companies typically display one or several of the following characteristics: innovative abilities, leadership in a major industry, a strong moat, or exciting growth potential. That's not an exhaustive list of traits such corporations can have, but they are among the most important.\n\nTo find businesses that display them, it can be helpful to start by looking at companies that have already passed the test of time. Let's look at two examples: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Abbott Laboratories(NYSE: ABT). Beyond the strong prospects they offer, these two well-known businesses are also excellent dividend payers worth holding on to for good.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nFew companies are more popular than Microsoft. That's an important advantage in and of itself -- it means the company's brand is well known and enjoys relatively high consumer trust.\n\nMicrosoft has become synonymous with many of the services it offers. No company gets close to its share of the computer operating system market. Microsoft's productivity tools are the norm for millions of people and businesses, many of which rely on them for their day-to-day activities; that arguably grants Microsoft high switching costs, a potent competitive edge.\n\nStill, Microsoft's OS business isn't much of a growth machine anymore. Thankfully, the company has other exciting opportunities: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft is second only to Amazon in the cloud market, though the latter has been closing in on the former.\n\nAI is providing yet another vital boost to Microsoft's cloud business. The company also benefits from switching costs in this field. Microsoft is a leader in every field in which it operates, whether in AI, cloud computing, computer OS, or gaming.\n\nThat's excellent evidence that the company is incredibly innovative, an important reason it has performed well over the years. MSFT Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nEverything points to Microsoft still delivering strong financial performances and market-beating returns in the long run. Note the company's free cash flow: $70.58 billion.\n\nA company's ability to generate strong free cash flow isn't just a sign of a robust underlying business. It also allows it to invest in more growth opportunities. Beyond those Microsoft is currently pursuing, the company will undoubtedly find more.\n\nAnd here's another piece of evidence of the company's strong business: Microsoft boasts an AAA rating from Standard & Poor's. That's a higher rating than the U.S. government itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about Microsoft's dividend? The company's yield isn't impressive; it's just 0.66%. However, the tech giant has increased its payouts by 168% in the past 10 years. Its cash payout ratio of 30.11% is conservative -- perhaps too conservative. Microsoft has ample room for more increases.\n\nDividend investors can't go wrong with Microsoft, nor can those looking for reliable corporations to invest in for good.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nDeveloping innovative medical technologies is a surefire way to survive for a long time. In that department, there aren't many companies with a better track record than Abbott Laboratories.\n\nThe medical device giant has a long lineup of products across its cardiovascular and diabetes care segments. Abbott Laboratories' FreeStyle Libre franchise, a series of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems that help diabetics track their blood glucose levels, has been the company's biggest growth driver in recent years. The company highlighted that the FreeStyle Libre is now the most successful medical device in history in terms of dollar sales.\n\nBeyond medical devices, Abbott Laboratories' nutrition, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals segments grant it significant diversification. Abbott Laboratories holds patents that protect its devices from being knocked off, at least for the duration of the patent, an important competitive advantage for companies across many industries, including healthcare.\n\nHere's another critical moat source for Abbott Laboratories: The company has successfully navigated the highly regulated healthcare sector for a long time. It knows its way around and has developed a brand name people trust. That's one reason Abbott Laboratories has performed exceptionally well. ABT Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nWith the world's aging population, the severely underpenetrated diabetes market -- just 1% of adults with the disease in the world have access to CGM technology -- and many other opportunities, Abbott Laboratories can still deliver superior returns.\n\nAbbott Laboratories is also an exceptional dividend stock. It has increased its payouts for 52 consecutive years. It might not be the most exciting business, but it looks reliable enough to sustain strong returns and growing payouts for a long time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why small caps are showing up the tech titans: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSmall caps are solving Wall Street's concentration problem.\n\nThough small caps stumbled Wednesday, in the five prior trading days, the Russell 2000 (^RUT) rocketed an eyewatering 12% as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) barely remained green. It was a surge that had never been surpassed by any of the major US stock indexes, according to Bespoke.\n\nThe catalyzing event was last week's dovish Consumer Price Index, which reported an actual decline in prices of 0.1%. The sign change in inflation was enough to convince holdouts on Wall Street that there's more to stocks in 2024 than the well-known cadre of tech titans riding the artificial intelligence wave.\n\nBut laggards are once again turning to leaders, bringing to mind the \"everything rally\" that dominated the fourth quarter last year.\n\nAs the Magnificent titans wilt, smaller pockets of strength fill the leadership void. Sector rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets, they say. Tech stocks led by megacaps have caused the Nasdaq 100 to underperform since last Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 (not shown) soared 12%.\n\nSince last Tuesday's close, Real Estate has led the large-cap sectors, up 7%. On its heels, cyclicals and values are well represented \u2014 as Materials, Industrials, Energy, and Financials are all up about 5%.\n\nThe only two losers are also the highest-returning sectors for the year \u2014 Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) \u2014 down 4% and 2%, respectively.\n\nDelving into the financial sector, we see the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) has now clawed its way back to the drop-off point from last year's internet bank crisis. The 16% surge is a notable move for regionals, which have had a rough two years since their 2022 highs.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) also jumped more than 14% on Monday, and notched its first record high since March.\n\nWhile the prospect of tamer inflation is behind much of the move, Trump's surge in popularity after the weekend assassination attempt is also a factor. Investors believe banks will benefit from a lighter regulatory touch, and the steepening yield curve over the last week also helps.\n\nThen there's crypto. For all the talk about spot ether ETFs, the bitcoin halving, and Gary Gensler, Trump's crypto support has helped bring bitcoin (BTC-USD) back from a nasty sell-off that might have had bearish legs.\n\nAfter all the gyrations over the last week, the two leading sectors in 2024 remain Tech and Communication Services \u2014 each holding on to gains of about 17%. But the handwringing over concentration can finally take a breather \u2014 at least, for now.\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Tech stocks led the market in the first half of 2024, and there is no reason they can't continue leading the market into the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be a game changer that should help power the sector higher in the years to come.\n\nLet's look at three tech stocks to buy this year and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo company has benefited more from the increased interest in AI than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are being used to harness the power of AI in the data center. The company has created a stranglehold on the GPU market through its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform that long ago became the industry standard for programming GPUs before AI became the next big thing.\n\nWith developers trained on its software platform, it has become difficult for other chipmakers to make a dent in Nvidia's dominance, and there does not appear to be anything on the horizon to challenge its market-leading position. At the same time, the company sped up its innovation cycle to further widen its lead, looking to push out new GPU architecture platforms almost every year.\n\nThe company's growth has been nothing short of spectacular, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% year over year to $26 billion. While that level of growth is unsustainable, demand for many of its chips outstrips supply, and customers are still in the early days of building out their AI infrastructures. This should continue to lead to strong growth in the years to come.\n\nAt the same time, given its growth, the stock is reasonably priced at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 47 times. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhile Nvidia has been at the forefront of AI on the chip side, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been the AI leader on the cloud computing and software side. Through its partnership with and investment in OpenAI, Microsoft has incorporated AI throughout its various offerings.\n\nIts Azure cloud-computing business has been the biggest beneficiary of AI thus far, as shown by the segment's revenue jumping 31% year over year last quarter. This is a pay-as-you-go business where customers pay only for the resources they use, and that usage has been soaring as clients use the Azure platform to build their own AI solutions. The company has seen deals getting bigger, with Azure deals worth more than $10 million last quarter doubling and $100 million-plus deals up 80%.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's introduction of AI assistant Copilots is helping power other parts of its business as well. Its GitHub Copilot, which can make suggestions to help complete coding, helped power a 45% increase in revenue for its developer platform GitHub segment. The company is also using AI in its Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn offerings, which helped drive 14% and 29% year-over-year revenue growth, respectively, in each segment last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of under 34 times, the stock's valuation is consistent with where it has traded over the past five years. Given the growth potential from AI in front of it, this is a solid stock to buy at current levels. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n3. DocuSign\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft have been early AI leaders, DocuSign(NASDAQ: DOCU) has the potential to be a later AI beneficiary. The company known for its e-signature solution has witnessed its growth slow as it saw a lot of pull forward in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then saw one of its biggest end markets, residential real estate, come under pressure.\n\nHowever, this company has a cash-rich balance sheet and generates a lot of free cash flow. At the same time, with its new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) solution, it is looking to combine its e-signature and contract lifecycle management (CLM) products to become a platform company.\n\nIt will also begin incorporating AI technology into its new IAM platform, which it obtained from its recent acquisition of AI-powered agreement-management software company Lexion. The company has already introduced a number of new features to be included in IAM, such as Maestro, which can create agreements without coding, and Navigator, which can store and analyze a customer's agreement databases. DOCU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio under 18 and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple of under 12, the stock is attractively valued, given its leading position in the e-signature market and potential growth drivers with its new IAM solution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after a rout in chipmaking stocks, on concerns over more trade disruptions, sparked steep losses on Wall Street.\n\nGrowing bets on early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also spurred a broader pivot away from technology stocks and into more growth-sensitive sectors. This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge to record highs even as its Wall Street peers lagged.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,652.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,067.0 points by 20:43 ET (00:43 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,589.0 points.\n\nChip stocks rise after China fears, Trump comments spur steep losses\n\nHeavyweight technology and chipmaking stocks rose in aftermarket trade after clocking outsized losses during the session.\n\nHeavyweights such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 1% after a 6.6% slide, while TSMC (NYSE:TSM) rose 2.4% after a nearly 8% tumble. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also steadied after falling during the session.\n\nReports that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, battered the sector, given that it could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\nConcerns over heightened geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan dented chip stocks, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by a broader shift into more economically sensitive sectors, amid growing bets that the Fed will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nThis saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.6% to a record high of 41,198.08 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,588.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite finished down 2.8% at 17,997.81 points.\n\nNetflix, TSMC earnings awaited\n\nFocus remained on the second quarter earnings season, with technology majors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and TSMC set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nTSMC is considered a bellwether for the chipmaking industry, and is expected to log a bumper second quarter profit on increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nLithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), which is also considered a bellwether for the chip industry, clocked stronger than expected second quarter earnings, as it flagged increased demand from the AI industry.\n\nEarnings from Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX), Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) are also due on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as chip rout eases; more earnings awaited\n\nAustralia's Domino's Pizza slumps to over 9-year low on bleak store growth view\n\nInsurance broker TWFG prices US IPO above range to raise about $187 million\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The technology sector continues to be one of the most desired industries for investors. Its rapid innovation has created some of the world\u2019s most valuable companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWith the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), fintech and cybersecurity, finding the best tech stocks to buy is a great strategy. While these industries can help investors grow their wealth, it is important to understand the risks. There are thousands of tech companies listed on the stock market, and many of them do not pan out.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for investors to be extremely selective and stick with the company\u2019s with long track records of success. This can be through a combination of market share, revenue and earnings growth and consistent cash flows. While past performance is not indicative of future results, investing in the technology sector is a great way to build wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top three tech stocks to buy to 10X your money in the long term!\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a leading fintech stock with enormous long term potential. The company\u2019s investments in digital transformation, which includes digital payment solutions, position it well for long-term success.\n\nAmerican Express is undoubtedly one of the best tech stocks to buy in 2024. Over the last year, its revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth, boosted by strong customer engagement and demand for its premium product offerings. In 2023, new card acquisitions totaled 12.2 million, bringing its total network to over 140 million. CEO Stephen Squeri remains confident in the investments it is making in areas like digital wallets and tokenization to expand its customer base in 2024. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion. New card acquisitions hit a record 3.4 million in the quarter, with earnings per share up 39% to $3.33 per share. With a clear focus on the millennial and Gen Z segments, AXP stock is uniquely positioned to benefit from the resurgence in travel demand in 2024 and beyond.\n\nGodaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a leading domain registrar and web hosting company. It is also a tech company with extraordinary long-term potential. As more businesses migrate to online, Godaddy will continue to dominate and grow its revenue, earnings and market share.\n\nGodaddy is among the best tech stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. The company hit a key inflection point in 2023, instilling confidence in the business moving forward. While revenue increased a modest 4% from 2022, its strong operational execution drove its earnings and free cash flow to record heights. Moreover, net earnings swelled 295% year over year to $1.4 billion, with free cash flow up 11% to $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, momentum continued to build with earnings up 749% year-over-year to $401.5 million. Additionally, Godaddy continues to diversify its product offerings including its new Airo platform that includes a full suite of AI tools. With the company recently added to the S&P 500, the sky is truly the limit for this under-the-radar tech giant.\n\nQualys (QLYS) A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. It, too, is one of the top tech stocks to buy to grow your wealth. With cyber-crimes accelerating, Qualys is a compelling investment opportunity that you can\u2019t miss.\n\nQualys provides customers with a broad range of cybersecurity solutions, including vulnerability management, threat detection and compliance. With the increased frequency and boldness of cyber attacks, businesses of all sizes will need more robust security measures. The company\u2019s cloud-based solutions and TruRisk platform is uniquely positioned to address these challenges.\n\nFurthermore, Qualys\u2019 growing revenue, earnings and free cash flow is a positive sign for the business. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $554.5 million. Earnings per share rose 47% from the year prior, with free cash flow hitting a record $236 million. Additionally, revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2024. With cyber-crimes remaining a pressing problem in business, Qualys will continue to benefit from the rise in cybersecurity spending.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Big AI\u2019s \u2018reverse acqui-hire\u2019 deals get more scrutiny in the U.K. and U.S.",
        "content": "When Microsoft dropped its observer seat on OpenAI\u2019s board last week\u2014and Apple abandoned reported plans to gain such a seat\u2014the uptick in regulatory scrutiny around the AI sector was a clear culprit. And the scope of that scrutiny just widened further.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, yesterday gave notice that it\u2019s in the early stages of probing Microsoft\u2019s March hiring of key staff from AI startup Inflection, which came with $650 million in licensing fees for Inflection.\n\nThe hired crew included Inflection cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft\u2019s in-house AI efforts. This seemed to be a case of Microsoft trying to avoid becoming over-reliant on OpenAI, into which it has invested $13 billion for a profit share. But authorities also want to check that the nature of the deal (a so-called reverse acqui-hire, as a more traditional acqui-hire would involve buying the company) wasn\u2019t also a tactic to sidestep antitrust rules that might be more clearly triggered by a straightforward acquisition.\n\nThe CMA\u2019s initial probe formally begins today, and the watchdog will decide by Sept. 11 whether to press on with a proper merger investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reports that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2014which has already been nosing around the Microsoft-Inflection deal since early June\u2014is also asking questions about Amazon\u2019s deal with AI startup Adept late last month.\n\nThis was a very similar arrangement, with CEO David Luan and other key Adept players joining Amazon and Amazon paying Adept to license its technology. One might also see a parallel between Microsoft\u2019s earlier OpenAI investment and Amazon\u2019s earlier investment of $4 billion into OpenAI rival Anthropic.\n\nApart from the difference in dynamics stemming from the fact that OpenAI is so far a much bigger name than Anthropic, there does seem to be a playbook here, and it\u2019s no surprise that U.S. and U.K. (and EU) regulators would like to know if rules are being skirted. U.S. lawmakers are certainly upset about the trend. \u201cA few companies control a major portion of the market, and just concentrate\u2014rather than on innovation\u2014trying to buy out everybody else\u2019s talent,\u201d complained Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Or.) last week.\n\nIncidentally, there are also a couple more interesting news tidbits out there about AI regulation.\n\nFirst, King Charles III announced today that the U.K.\u2019s new Labour government will \u201cseek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models\u201d\u2014a big shift from the previous Conservative government\u2019s hands-off approach.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, with the EU now having officially published its own AI Act\u2014its rules on model-makers will begin to apply from February next year\u2014European privacy regulators said yesterday that they would be the right ones to enforce the new law in many cases. \u201cI strongly believe that [data protection authorities] are suitable for this role because of their full independence and deep understanding of the risks of AI for fundamental rights, based on their existing experience,\u201d said Irene Loizidou Nicolaidou, deputy chair of the watchdogs\u2019 umbrella body, the European Data Protection Board, in a statement.\n\nOf course, AI has been a big theme at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, this week, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn wrote yesterday. I was particularly intrigued by Jeremy\u2019s chat with Google chief scientist Jeff Dean, who warned against people overplaying AI\u2019s role in his company\u2019s rising carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of focus on the increasing energy usage of AI, and from a very small base that usage is definitely increasing,\u201d Dean said. \u201cBut I think people often conflate that with overall data center usage\u2014of which AI is a very small portion right now but growing fast\u2014and then attribute the growth rate of AI-based computing to the overall data center usage.\u201d\n\nA fair point, for now. But I think the criticisms of AI\u2019s massive hunger for energy will remain valid until companies like Google and Microsoft can prove that rolling it out doesn\u2019t mean deviating from their emissions-reduction goals.\n\nA few more articles based on yesterday\u2019s Brainstorm Tech action:\n\nHow trust and safety leaders at top tech companies are approaching the security threat of AI: \u2018Trust but verify\u2019\n\nWhy Grindr\u2019s CEO believes \u2018synthetic employees\u2019 are about to unleash a brutal talent war for tech startups\n\nSalesforce\u2019s AI chief says the company uses its Einstein products internally: \u2018We like to drink our own martinis\u2019\n\nHow VCs from Alphabet\u2019s CapitalG to Norwest are coping with a dead IPO landscape: \u2018We\u2019re not here to time the market\u2019\n\nSequoia\u2019s Roelof Botha says Silicon Valley\u2019s legendary VC firm will not take a political point of view on the election\n\nRent the Runway cofounder Jennifer Fleiss on why cofounder relationships are critical for mental wellness in the startup game\n\nTech talent and killer powder: The recipe that startups say is fueling the rise of Utah\u2019s Silicon Slopes\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Carbon Capture Stocks Cleaning Up Their Act",
        "content": "The carbon capture and sequestration market is expected to have a steady growth trajectory, which will be a boon for carbon capture stocks. This growth is being spurred by the enhanced efforts being made by the governments and the corporations in cutting down on CO2 emissions with a view of hitting the net-zero targets.\n\nNew innovations in the carbon capture technologies are improving the ways of capturing and storing carbon dioxide. Better technologies like Direct Air Capture, which captures CO2 from the atmosphere, are being seen more frequently.\n\nThese advancements are improving the efficiency of carbon capture, which, in turn, is increasing the interest in this area and the funding being put into it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, we\u2019re going to see an increase in investor appetite for carbon capture stocks moving forward. So here are three companies for investors to consider adding to their portfolios.\n\nExxonMobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has developed an elaborate plan to tackle carbon emissions and facilitate the shift towards the usage of cleaner energy through a number of CCS projects.\n\nXOM\u2019s hydrogen production plant is one of the cornerstones of ExxonMobil\u2019s CCS projects. This initiative will generate as much as 1 billion cubic feet of \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen every day, alongside the mechanisms for storing up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year.\n\nThis project is expected to cut the complex\u2019s CO2 emissions by at least 30%, and therefore contribute to ExxonMobil\u2019s objective of delivering net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050.\n\nExxonMobil annually captures about 9 million metric tons of CO2 and has captured over 120 million metric tons capturing a market share of about 40% of all the human-produced CO2 annually.\n\nThis positions XOM as one of those carbon capture stocks making a huge pivot in their operations from the traditional oil industry.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother company that has taken part in CCS projects with the aim of cutting its carbon footprint is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). The company\u2019s subsidiary, 1PointFive, is instrumental in this regard as it concentrates on the scaling up of DAC technologies.\n\nThe STRATOS DAC facility in Texas is one of the key projects under 1PointFive. This is a world-class plant with the capacity of capturing 500,000 metric tons of CO2 every year, thus, offering a long term solution to curbing carbon emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCollaborations with companies like\u00a0AT&T (NYSE:T) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are reportedly in place as these organizations have invested in the purchase of carbon removal credits.\n\nOXY highlights how organizations are able to leverage carbon capture for shareholders and not purely an expectation of them or an altruistic exercise, offering real incentives to clean up one\u2019s act. This makes it one of those carbon capture stocks to buy.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) leverages its solid-oxide fuel cell platform for carbon capture. Another famous project of Bloom Energy is a partnership with Shell (NYSE:SHEL) to build sustainable hydrogen energy solutions.\n\nThe objective of this partnership is to apply Bloom\u2019s solid oxide electrolyzer technology to generate clean hydrogen that can be utilized in the decarbonization of sectors which are hard to electrify.\n\nThis partnership is aimed at the development of modular technologies that will be used to replace the current hydrogen production from fossil fuels. This will help in minimizing the emission of greenhouse gasses.\n\nAlso, Bloom Energy has been in the process of incorporating its fuel cell technology with carbon capture systems.\n\nBE stock\u2019s presence in the industry is a striking contrast to XOM. It underlines how innovative startups can help the world move towards a greener future. This means that BE is one of those carbon capture stocks to consider along with the more established names in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Thanks to generative AI technologies and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a chip giant supplying much of the technology required to bring in the AI revolution, AI stocks are a hot commodity this year.\n\nAdditionally, the technology behind generative AI continues to improve. It now has models that can make high-quality movies and pictures. Applied AI research company, Runway, for example, is leading the way with new generative video models that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) are considering for film usage.\n\nMoreover, a recent McKinsey survey found that creative AI is being employed in marketing, sales, and IT. Due to this acceptance, human resources costs are down, and supply chain and inventory management revenue is rising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowing from 36.6% to 36.8% yearly, the global AI industry is predicted to reach $1.345 trillion to $1.811 trillion by 2030. Certain forecasts see the market reaching $2.740 trillion by 2032, making AI stocks vital to future-proof any portfolio.\n\nNorth America dominates AI due to major AI stocks based in the region, robust research institutes, and attractive investment circumstances. The region earned 36.8% of global AI revenue in 2022. However, Asia-Pacific will also see significant growth in this area.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at three \u201cstrong buy\u201d AI stocks with double-digit upsides, all of which hold plenty of firepower to make a run for their 52-week highs.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares are down 29% in 2024 as investors worry about falling margins and retention rates, placing it precariously among AI stocks. However, Snowflake can mount a comeback, and the stock shows an average price target of $200.97, indicating a 50% upside potential from its current price of $133.72.\n\nProduct innovations and key alliances will drive Snowflake\u2019s growth. Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI engine now has vector search, massive language models, and other advancements. These solutions let companies automate analytics and properly leverage corporate data to develop AI-powered applications.\u200b\n\nAdditionally, Snowflake now works more closely with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Low-code/no-code application development, data governance tools, Snowflake\u2019s Data Cloud, and Microsoft\u2019s AI are the partners\u2019 goals.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric and Snowflake enable Apache Iceberg and bidirectional data under their partnership. Using this link, customers may work with a single copy of their data in many formats, simplifying data management and platform compatibility.\u200b\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake also announced a deeper NVIDIA partnership at Summit 2024. This agreement allows enterprises to swiftly construct custom AI solutions by integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI business software into Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI platform.\n\nTo give advanced language models to its Data Cloud, Snowflake partnered with Mistral AI. This agreement allows Snowflake customers to leverage Mistral AI\u2019s robust language models, Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral Large, for AI applications.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up 11% this year, experts feel there is more space to expand; the average price target is $856.04, which is an 11.5% upside potential from the current price of $767.85.\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 financials from ServiceNow were robust. Having $1.82 EPS and $2.60 billion in sales, the company exceeded analysts\u2019 projections. ServiceNow was financially strong shown by its 13.59% return on equity and 20.34% net profit. The most recent financial results from ServiceNow show encouraging trends in the last three quarters, therefore validating its winning run.\n\nServiceNow unveiled its creative artificial intelligence technologies at Knowledge 2024 as well. These AI-powered improvements seek to automate and simplify several organizational processes in order to raise customer results.\n\nPlus, Clear Skye debuted Identity Governance and Administration 5.1 on ServiceNow. This version streamlines corporate operations and enhances identity security to provide consumers a safer, more consistent experience.\n\nExpanding their strategic alliance to provide consumers greater artificial intelligence freedom and options, ServiceNow and Microsoft are letting ServiceNow\u2019s platform interact with Microsoft\u2019s creative AI products, such as Azure OpenAI.\n\nAdditionally, Sonatype and ServiceNow are working to streamline software composition research. This will help companies manage open-source components and alliances, hence enhancing software security.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu\u2019s (NASDAQ:BIDU) first-quarter earnings did much to allay investor fears, which is why 13 out of 16 analysts covering the stock rate the Chinese tech giant a \u201cbuy.\u201d Consensus points to an average price target of $145.79, translating to a potential 56% upside.\n\nIn Q1 2024, core revenue rose 4% to $3.30 billion, while online marketing revenue was up 3% to $2.36 billion. Significant expansion of Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud company has driven a 6% year-over-year rise in non-online marketing income. Generative AI integration into the company\u2019s offerings is also showing promising outcomes.\n\nBaidu anticipates $4.79 billion in revenue and $2.69 EPS next quarter. The 2024 revenue forecast is $20.34 billion, up 8.76% from the previous year.\n\nThe business intends to keep investing in artificial intelligence and basic models, including the ERNIE Bot, which is supposed to generate fresh growth engines. Expanding its autonomous driving initiatives is another area of concentration for Baidu, which can help diversify its income sources and improve its market standing. Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go Robotaxi offering has grown very rapidly, thereby raising investor confidence.\n\nFurthermore, Baidu CEO Robin Li underlined the need to maintain a healthy relationship with Chinese authorities, which has allowed the business to negotiate legislative changes and keep its search and news feed products running smoothly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Buffett Believes Picking Stocks Can Be Risky: Consider Investing In These ETFs Instead\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett is known for making bold investment decisions, which have allowed him to become the world's eighth richest man, with a net worth of over $136 billion. But that isn't the reason behind Buffett's popularity among retail investors \u2013 it is his cost-effective investment strategies focused on a company\u2019s valuation rather than market noise.\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\n\nBuffett has repeatedly touted the risks involved in handpicking stocks, given the shifting market dynamics and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. Nonetheless, the Oracle of Omaha believes that investing in index funds can help mitigate the risks substantially.\n\n\"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" Buffett said during the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it. In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.\"\n\nAs one of the biggest supporters of value investing, Buffett also believes in maintaining a routine while investing in index funds, especially during volatile times. Buffett stated in 2019 that he instructed his trustee to invest 90% of his wealth into a low-cost S&P 500 index after passing away.\n\n\"Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin. ... American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe will do very well,\" Buffett added.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)\n\nUp by over 25% over the past year, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) is a low-cost ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index, comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, making it ideal for passive investments.\n\nFurthermore, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF pays $7.19 in dividends annually, yielding nearly 1.3% on the current price. The ETF's top three largest holdings are Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) tracks the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With a low expense ratio of just 0.06%, the ETF primarily focuses on high-quality U.S. companies with a track record of consistently paying dividends.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF pays $2.83 in dividends annually, yielding an impressive 3.54% on the current price. Its top holdings include The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).\n\nThis ETF offers potential for capital appreciation and a steady income stream through dividends, making it suitable for income-oriented investors.\n\nFidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund\n\nThe Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index is part of Fidelity\u2019s \u201cZERO\u201d line of index funds, which boast zero expense ratios.\n\nThe ETF primarily invests in the largest companies in the U.S. by market capitalization, providing investors with cost-effective exposure to some of the biggest and most established companies in the market. Interestingly, The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index has gained 25.13% over the past year, surpassing the benchmark S&P 500 index's 24.4% returns.\n\nIts top holdings include the Magnificent Seven stocks, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, and semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom Inc.

        "content": "Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) biggest-ever acquisition could face US pushback no matter who wins the White House this November.\n\nThe reported $23 billion bid to buy fast-growing cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz is the kind that is almost sure to attract scrutiny from Washington competition watchdogs, along with inevitable delays.\n\nA US regulatory review could stall a tie-up into next year, making it possible that a new administration could be tasked with evaluating its competitive risks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Alphabet, which is already fighting antitrust challenges on other fronts, would be free of yet another legal fight.\n\n\"The current administration looks at vertical issues more heavily than has historically been the case,\" Colin Kass, a partner with Proskauer and co-chair of the firm\u2019s antitrust group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But even the prior administration, under Trump, did look at vertical issues even more so than earlier administrations.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what\u2019s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet\u2019s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Microsoft decides diversity \u2018no longer business critical\u2019, claims sacked manager",
        "content": "Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has decided diversity is \u201cno longer business critical\u201d, a former manager has claimed, after the company sacked two staff working on initiatives focused on inclusivity.\n\nThe tech giant laid off the employees working on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, just four years after it pledged to double the number of black leaders within the company by 2025.\n\nAn email sent by one of the sacked workers, seen by Business Insider, said: \u201cTrue systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said that\u00a0the company\u2019s commitments in this area \u201cremain unchanged\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritising accountability, and continuing to focus on this work,\u201d he said.\n\nIt comes after a wave of companies increased their attention on diversity following the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer. The incident triggered a wave of protests by the Black Lives Matter movement, with the number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives almost trebling in the wake of the demonstrations.\n\nHowever, many companies have rowed back on or abandoned such initiatives in recent months as they battle soaring costs. Meta, Tesla and X (formerly known as Twitter) have all cut the size of their respective DEI teams by 50pc or more in 2023.\n\nZoom told staff earlier this year that it had dismantled its DEI team amid layoffs, which reflected a wider trend across the West.\n\nThe number of DEI jobs in the US shrunk 8pc during the first six weeks of 2024, data sourced by Revelio Labs and The Washington Post showed in February.\n\nDiversity consultants expect a similar trend to take place in the UK. Simon Fanshawe, who was one of six activists to set up LGBT charity Stonewall, said in May that he had witnessed a shift in attitude among employers over the role that diversity schemes should have in corporate Britain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt seemed self-evidently right [in the past] but now they\u2019re saying, \u2018Actually, I\u2019m not convinced that a high street retailer should take a position on anti-conversion therapy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Because what\u2019s that got to do with the price of beans?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs well as cutting costs, companies are reconsidering their DEI plans amid fears that some diversity chiefs are silencing anyone with an opposing view and taking HR matters into their own hands.\n\nFran Itkoff, 90, from California, who had volunteered for a multiple sclerosis charity for more than 60 years, was forced to step down in January after she told a colleague she did not understand why she needed to add the pronouns \u201cshe/her\u201d to her email signature.\n\nThe National MS Society confirmed at the time that she \u201cwas asked to step away from her role because of statements that were viewed as not aligning with our policy of inclusion\u201d.\n\nThe subsequent backlash prompted the charity to apologise for what it said had been a \u201cmistake\u201d.",

        "title": "Analyst Thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Has More Upside Due to AI",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Has More Upside Potential?\n\ntanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMSFT is one of the top names in King Lip\u2019s portfolio.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows. Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal second quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of Al adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 28% in constant currency of which 6% was Al related versus 3% last quarter. Further, management noted most of the Al revenue was from inference rather than training indicating high quality Al applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America have begun to trail off. suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are abating. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in Al. given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy in July 2024 and Hold Until You\u2019re 70",
        "content": "The market offers plenty of options, but only a select few have the potential to be true long-term winners. Not many people can look at a company and say that they have good enough conviction that the business in question will remain relevant a few decades from now. Even half a decade can completely change everything\u2014as some can speak from personal experience.\n\nThus, it is important not to get \u201ctunnel visioned\u201d and keep your skin in the game. The means to an end matter. You should always be ready to sell if any of these companies become obsolete or face major stumbles in the coming decades. It pays to be flexible.\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking at seven stocks that I personally think will be relevant in 20 or 30-plus years. Their historical records and market dominance give me peace of mind for the long haul. However, it\u2019s equally important to focus on short-term growth. Remember, if you only wanted stability, you could park your money in bonds. We want our money to compound. Thus, each pick offers a blend of stability and growth and aims at nearer-term returns, too. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:INTU) makes tools for robotic-assisted surgery and is riding high on the megatrends of minimally invasive procedures and an aging population. Q1 procedure volumes surged 16% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nThis company simply has a massive runway for expansion. With its current clearances, the company estimates it can reach around seven million patients annually, over three times its current patient base. New product launches like the da Vinci 5 in the U.S. and Europe should further fuel adoption.\n\nFinancially, Intuitive Surgical is firing on all cylinders. Its Q1 revenue jumped 11% to $1.89 billion, while GAAP net income soared 53% to $545 million. Analysts are bullish, too.\n\nSure, challenges exist, such as competition in China. However, with the stock up 32% year-to-date (YTD) and demographics in its favor, Intuitive Surgical\u2019s best days are still ahead.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) has been a standout performer in the stock market lately.\u00a0The stock is up over 30% YTD. It has even been outshining Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Costco reported strong Q3 of fiscal year 2024 results, with revenue growing 9.1% to $57.39 billion and e-commerce sales jumping an impressive 20.7%. Net income surged nearly 30% to $1.68 billion. Same store sales growth has also started to pick up.\n\nStory continues stocks to buy: costco same store sales growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFurthermore, analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer raised its price target to $950, citing Costco\u2019s solid June sales driven by non-foods and its upcoming membership fee hike. Other firms like Baird, Loop Capital and Stifel also boosted their targets. The average 12-month analyst price target is now $910.05, implying an 8% upside.\n\nCostco has consistently been gaining market share. It benefits from loyal members and a compelling value proposition. Nevertheless, Costco does lag behind its rivals in key growth areas like e-commerce and advertising. Thus, future gains may need to come more from earnings growth than valuation expansion. I\u2019m still very bullish on the long run.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company that serves a wide range of industries. I believe Linde will remain one of the most consistent and stable stocks in the market going forward. The industrial gas sector has huge staying power, and Linde\u2019s revenues and profits should stay sticky even as the white-collar world rapidly changes.\n\nSeveral megatrends are providing tailwinds for Linde\u2019s business, including the clean energy transition, digitization and the rise of advanced electronics manufacturing. Linde is investing heavily to capture growth from these trends, such as its recent $150 million investment to supply industrial gases to the world\u2019s first large-scale green steel plant. Analysts are bullish on the stock, with an average price target of $489.31 (as of writing). That implies around an 11.7% upside.\n\nAlso, Linde delivered solid Q1 of 2024 results, with 6% operating profit growth. The stock has surged 115% in just the past five years. Thus, I\u2019m optimistic Linde will continue its steady trajectory as a core industrial holding. Companies tied to long-standing industries with enduring demand rarely underperform.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting services to government agencies and corporations. BAH stock has climbed an impressive 136% over the past five years, and I believe it has room to run higher.\n\nThe company is deeply embedded with many federal agencies that are expanding operations as the geopolitical environment grows more complex. BAH\u2019s expertise in areas like AI, cybersecurity and digital transformation aligns perfectly with the increasing technology needs of its government clients. I expect federal agencies will only become more reliant on the type of sophisticated solutions Booz Allen Hamilton delivers.\n\nThe firm posted Q1 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenue of $2.77 billion both topping expectations. While analyst opinions are mixed, the average price target of $168.78 points to further upside potential. I\u2019m optimistic Booz Allen can sustain its impressive growth trajectory as it capitalizes on powerful tailwinds in the government services market. This is a high-quality company that looks poised to thrive for decades to come.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) operates over 10,500 stores globally and generates over $600 billion in annual revenue. The company has been one of the best-performing retail stocks in 2024 so far, with shares jumping 29% in the first half of the year. Walmart crushed earnings expectations in Q1, with revenue growing 6% to $161.5 billion.\n\nThe company is rapidly automating its supply chain, which should massively increase profit margins in the coming years. In addition, Walmart is gaining grocery market share, growing e-commerce sales by 24%, and seeing huge tailwinds across the business. Per-store sales have naturally been booming, too. WMT sales per store\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI\u2019m confident this retail giant will continue to thrive for decades to come. While many retailers are struggling, Walmart looks poised to go from strength to strength. For patient investors, Walmart stock is a solid bet.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s leading e-commerce and cloud computing company. The company offers unparalleled exposure to two massive growth industries for decades to come. No other U.S. company can match Amazon\u2019s e-commerce dominance.\n\nBeyond retail, Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business gives it a stronghold in another critical sector. If artificial intelligence (AI) fulfills its immense promise, cloud providers like AWS stand to benefit enormously. Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the AI revolution. The company recently committed $230 million to expand its Generative AI Accelerator program for startups.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 28.5% this year (as of writing) as investors recognize its leadership in e-commerce and cloud. Moreover, today and tomorrow\u2019s Prime Days event could set new sales records, with JPMorgan analysts highlighting AI-powered shopping tools as a key driver.\n\nAmazon\u2019s financials are also robust, with $143 billion in Q1 revenue and 13% YOY growth. The company continues to innovate across its businesses while improving profitability. Amazon is uniquely positioned to ride multiple technological megatrends in the coming decades.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may be the single best bet on the software industry. This company has its hands on everything.\n\nWindows remains hugely popular globally. Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity apps spans industries. Moreover, Microsoft deserves immense credit for making the AI breakthrough a reality through its massive early investments in OpenAI.\n\nThose investments are now paying off handsomely. OpenAI is using Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud to power its AI systems. Additionally, Microsoft will receive a substantial share of OpenAI\u2019s future profits. And, the company maintains significant influence over OpenAI\u2019s direction.\n\nIn Q3 of 2024, revenue grew 17% YOY to $61.9 billion. Azure cloud revenue surged 31%. Cloud adoption is accelerating across industries. And of course, AI integration is driving increased demand for Microsoft\u2019s products and services.\n\nFew companies are as well-positioned to capitalize on the most important technology trends shaping our future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of senior figures from start-up Inflection AI, having previously raised concerns about close partnerships between firms in the sector.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was looking into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of former Inflection staff, as well as \u201centry into associated arrangements\u201d by Microsoft with the AI firm as part of a merger inquiry.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the creation of a new team, Microsoft AI, which will be led by British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman, who was the head of start-up Inflection AI, having previously founded DeepMind, the AI firm now owned by Google.\n\nA number of other Inflection staff have followed Mr Suleyman to Microsoft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince then, the CMA has published a report raising concerns about the potential risks to open, fair and effective competition in the AI market.\n\nThe report specifically identified what it called an \u201cinterconnected web\u201d of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments between a small handful of the biggest tech and AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector.\n\nThe competition watchdog then asked for views from interested parties on the partnerships, including those between Microsoft and Mistral AI, Amazon and Anthropic, and Microsoft\u2019s links to Inflection.\n\nAmazon has invested around four billion dollars (\u00a33.2 billion) in Anthropic as it looks to gain an advantage in the AI race, while Microsoft announced a multi-year partnership with French AI start-up Mistral earlier this year, which is reported to include investment of around \u00a313 million.\n\nMicrosoft is also the biggest investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, while Apple has signed into partnership with OpenAI to embed ChatGPT into future versions of the iPhone as part of its Apple Intelligence scheme to bring more generative AI tools to its products.\n\nThe CMA now has until September 11 to complete its initial investigation and make on decision on whether a more in-depth investigation is needed.\n\nMicrosoft has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British regulators opened a preliminary investigation on Tuesday into Microsoft's hiring of an AI startup's key staff over concerns that it could thwart competition in the booming artificial intelligence market.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said its review of the hirings from Inflection AI, including its co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, turned up \u201csufficient information\u201d to open an investigation.\n\nMicrosoft hired Suleyman to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business earlier this year, and brought over several top engineers and researchers. Suleyman co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind, which is now owned by Google, before setting up Inflection and is considered an influential figure in the AI world.\n\nThe watchdog has indicated that it was assessing whether the hirings amount to a merger that results in \u201ca substantial lessening of competition\u201d in the U.K.'s AI market, in breach of the country's antitrust rules.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,\" Microsoft said in a statement. \"We will provide the UK Competition and Markets Authority with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.\u201d\n\nThe British watchdog has until Sept. 11 to decide whether to give its approval or escalate the probe into an in-depth investigation. The authority has the power to reverse deals or impose fixes to address competition concerns.\n\nAuthorities on both sides of the Atlantic have become concerned about how the biggest technology companies are gobbling up the talent and products of innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.\n\nThree members of the U.S. Senate wrote last week to antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, urging them to investigate Amazon's purchase of San Francisco-based Adept.

        "content": "By Krystal Hu, Greg Bensinger and Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has asked Amazon.com to provide more details on its deal to hire top executives and researchers from artificial intelligence startup Adept, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe request reflects the FTC's growing concern about how AI deals have been put together and follows a broader review of partnerships between Big Tech and prominent AI startups.\n\nThe informal inquiry into Amazon, which has not previously been reported, centers on last month's announcement that Adept Chief Executive David Luan and others were leaving to join Amazon, which would also license some of the startup's technology.\n\nSuch inquiries do not necessarily result in an official investigation or enforcement action.\n\nAmazon is trying to catch up with rivals Google and Microsoft, which partners with OpenAI, in developing its own large language models that can respond almost instantaneously to complicated prompts or queries.\n\nReuters previously reported on Amazon's efforts to establish a new organization called the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) team, focused on developing large language models. Luan is now running the \u201cAGI Autonomy\u201d team, consisting of many former Adept employees, and reporting to Rohit Prasad, head of the AGI team.\n\nFounded in 2022, Adept made a splash by raising over $400 million from venture capital investors with the aim to train large language models to perform general tasks for enterprise clients. Once valued at over $1 billion, it released some open-source models but failed to launch successful commercial products. It's unclear whether Amazon has compensated Adept investors, or the details of the licensing fees.\n\nAmazon, Adept and the FTC declined to comment.\n\nThe regulator is already investigating a similar move by Microsoft, which hired away much of another startup, Inflection AI's leadership and employees and agreed to pay a roughly $650 million licensing fee. The FTC is looking into whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, a source told Reuters last month.\n\nThis is not Amazon's first AI startup bet. Amazon has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic since September, taking a minority stake in the San Francisco company.\n\nThe FTC earlier this year launched a study of investments and partnerships in the AI space, demanding information on Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, and Anthropic's tie ups with Google and Amazon.\n\nThe extensive document request, made in January, seeks details on how AI company partnerships with Big Tech influence strategy, pricing decisions, access to products and services, and personnel decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcers also expressed concern about Big Tech companies wielding their existing advantages in AI to shut out smaller competitors. The FTC and Justice Department have staked out responsibility for potential probes into Microsoft, OpenAI and chipmaker Nvidia.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco, Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.\u2019s investment into Inflection AI will get a full-blown UK antitrust probe, after the watchdog said it needed to take a closer look at the hiring of former employees from the artificial intelligence startup.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Amazon Sold a Used Diaper.

It highlighted worries that the Silicon Valley companies were using this as a way to control and shape the nascent markets in the future.\n\nIt signaled that it would use its powers under merger control rules to decide whether some of these deals could fall under UK scrutiny, noting that some partnerships aren\u2019t structured like a traditional deal. It initially looked at Microsoft\u2019s investment into Mistral AI but found the tech firm hadn\u2019t acquired the ability to materially influence Mistral\u2019s commercial policy.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Inflection deal was what some have characterized as an \u201cacquihire\u201d \u2014 without the \u201cacquisition\u201d part. Microsoft agreed to pay Inflection $650 million, largely to license its AI software, alongside the move to hire much of the startup\u2019s staff, a person familiar with the arrangement said at the time.\n\nMicrosoft hired Mustafa Suleyman as well as Inflection\u2019s Chief Scientist and co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, along with most of the startup\u2019s employees earlier this year. Inflection, which had raised more than $1.5 billion and debuted a chatbot named PI, still struggled to find an effective business model, Suleyman had said after the launch.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cWe will provide the UK CMA with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only big tech company that has been heavily recruiting the staff of AI startups. Amazon.com Inc. recently hired top executives and other employees from startup Adept AI Labs Inc., including its co-founder and former chief executive officer, according to an internal memo Amazon provided to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeparately, last week Microsoft dropped its plans to take board roles at OpenAI in a decision that was seen as a way to try and dodge growing regulatory scrutiny. Regulators in the US and Europe had expressed concerns about Microsoft\u2019s sway over OpenAI. The UK regulator is still to make a decision on whether to open a probe into the OpenAI investment.\n\n--With assistance from Amy Thomson.\n\n(Updates with more information and background throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Making AI Stocks Set to Ride The Trend for the Long Run",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly impact the global economy and business in the coming years. While some debate sustainability of the current AI-driven growth, investors and traders alike consider AI stocks to buy. With AI technology undoubtedly here to stay, this disruption will reshape the way we work, conduct business and invest.\n\nMultiple stocks have seen dramatic gains in recent years due to AI adoption. However, they may be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are getting the lion\u2019s share of headlines and investor interest as they battle it out for the leading edge. Yet, as with the dot-com boom, millionaire-making stocks haven\u2019t grown yet despite witnessing substantial returns.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add $2.6-4.4 trillion globally in the coming years, allowing ample room for stock growth. As AI applications and technologies become more pervasive, the overall economic benefits are projected to be sizable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile large companies make headlines, smaller players with consistent earnings and projected continued AI-enabled expansion may be worth examining. Let\u2019s explore three stocks to buy for long-term AI-driven returns.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the stocks to buy that has the potential to return millions is DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The technology firm provides data analytics and user authentication services for online companies. Its primary focus is helping advertisers reach audiences and achieve effective, quality returns on sales. The company uses AI to increase fraud detection capabilities. It also offers AI as a service to enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising and optimize strategies for individual businesses.\n\nWhat makes DoubleVerify attractive as a growth stock is that it has consistently increased EPS over the last four years. The company is projected to continue doing so this year, delivering a 17% sales growth in 2024. Expanding into new markets like Meta (NASDAQ:META), YouTube and TikTok will probably weigh on its current earnings but is expected to enhance future growth.\n\nThis may explain why analysts are so positive about DV stock. The average price target is currently at $29.12 per share. This represents a potential upside of over 45%, which typically spans for a 1-year period.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is an internet communications platform company. It is most known for its shared-screen meetings, which were prevalent during the pandemic. As the end of lockdowns brought a major decline in demand, Zoom now integrates AI into its software. ZM provides a one-stop business solutions platform for arranging communications as companies navigate hybrid work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is trading near pre-pandemic levels after its stock grew approximately ten-fold during the height of the pandemic. This means that ZM stock price is around 90% below its all-time record high. However, the company has since integrated AI and evolved into a tech company trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.3x for a tech. This is well below the S&P 500 average of 29.3.\n\nAnalysts expect continued growth, making Zoom one of the stocks to buy with an average price target signaling over 30% upside. Notably, Zoom has beaten consensus EPS consistently over the prior several earnings reports, with surprises ranging in double-digit territory.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is known for its AutoCAD software, which serves as the backbone of engineering and architectural development.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as the leader in 3D AI evolution through the use of generative AI to produce functional 3D shapes. In addition to AutoCAD, Autodesk offers other products like Fusion 360 and Maya that serve the construction, manufacturing and media industries.\n\nWhile it applies AI to many industries, the company has not seen significant investor interest as its share price is up less than 5% for the year. However, Autodesk is particularly compelling because of its very low expenses due to a subscription-based business model. This results in a gross profit margin of 92%, with the largest cost being sales and marketing to acquire new customers.\n\nAutodesk expects 10% revenue growth in 2024 through consistent growth that is not reliant on short-term AI trends. Also, analysts are optimistic about the ADSK stock, with 19 out of 23 recommending buying Autodesk shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 16, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. TTSH.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Lilly and UnitedHealth\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Eli Lilly and Co. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, we now have Q2 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and only 44.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe one notable feature of this admittedly small and Finance-heavy sample of results is the very small proportion of the companies that are able to beat revenue estimates. The 44.8% revenue beats percentage compares to 69% for the same group of 29 S&P 500 members in the preceding quarter (2024 Q1) and is a low for the preceding 20 quarters.\n\nWe will be watching closely how the revenue beats percentage unfolds in the days ahead as we move into the heart of the Q2 earnings season.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have Q2 results from 20.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total Q2 earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Finance sector's EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking above the 20-quarter averages for this group of sector companies.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.4% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +25.9%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+62.7% vs. +24.2%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Its new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends.\r\n\r\nLilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares were in line with the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+5.6% vs. +5.5%). The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. UnitedHealth\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend.\r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Tile Shop have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +10.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $320.59 million has a strong financial health, with zero long-term debt and $24 million in cash as of first-quarter 2024. This positions the company to invest in growth and weather economic fluctuations.\r\n\r\nGross margins improved to 65.8% due to lower freight and product costs, reflecting effective cost management. Expansion of product lines, including new luxury vinyl tile (LVT) lines, enhances revenue diversification. E-commerce sales growth reflects a strategic shift to capture online markets. Effective cost management led to a 5.5% decline in SG&A expenses.\r\n\r\nYet, challenges include a 10.2% fall in comparable store sales, weak macroeconomic conditions, high SG&A expenses, inventory management issues and potential margin pressures. Dependence on professional customers, stiff competition and limited store footprint growth are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Snowflake Stock Meltdown: Is the Cloud Giant\u2019s Growth Story Over?",
        "content": "Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been in the cloud industry \u201cpenalty box\u201d since former CEO Frank Slootman retired suddenly at the end of February.\n\nSnowflake is a cloud data warehouse that competes with Cloud Giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as privately held competitors including Databricks, Motherduck and Clickhouse.\n\nIts fall has been precipitous. Snowflake stock sold at $230 per share before Slootman\u2019s announcement. It will open July 15 at about $136. It is still no bargain. The market cap is roughly 15 times expected sales of $3 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut is this something where you \u201cbuy on the dip?\u201d Or is this a broken growth story you need to walk away from?\n\nMassive Hack Attacks\n\nSnowflake is in the news right now for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt is responsible for a huge hack against AT&T (NYSE:T) and dozens of other companies that were storing data with it.\n\nSnowflake disclosed the hack on May 30. But it wasn\u2019t its technical systems that broke. According to the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) security subsidiary Mandiant, which investigated the problem, customers\u2019 contractors had their credentials stolen.\n\nBut blaming the victim doesn\u2019t work for me. First, as Mandiant noted, \u201cSome of the malware infections in Snowflake\u2019s systems date to 2020 and the credentials were, in some cases, still valid years after being stolen.\u201d Also, Snowflake only began demanding two-factor authentication from its users this month.\n\nIf I were a potential Snowflake customer, or even a current one, I\u2019d have to ask some hard questions, based on these facts. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like the answers.\n\nSlootman Out Before the Hammer Fell\n\nWhen Slootman stepped down in February, it was called an effort to \u201cstep up to AI.\u201d Slootman was called more of a business leader than a tech leader.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. Slootman is a tech leader. He began his career running the data testing operation at Borland, a 1990s era tools company. After the dot-com bubble popped he joined a storage startup called Data Domain (now part of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL)). Then he became CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). He is described as an \u201cinsanely confrontational\u201d leader.\n\nSnowflake was the third tech company he took public after Data Domain and ServiceNow. He was trusted by investors and thus able to run Snowflake from his home in Bozeman, Mont. A January profile on the Sequoia Capital site calls him a \u201cnext stage growth doctor.\u201d\n\nAs an investor, I like Frank Slootman. He supported his own myth by writing a book in 2022 called Amp it Up with blurbs by other tech leaders testifying to his greatness.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like \u201ca business leader\u201d who needs to give way to a \u201ctech leader.\u201d It sounds like a billionaire getting out of the way before the bad news hits. A hack that started in 2020, with credentials held by hackers for years, is not what customers and would-be customers want to read.\n\nThis is especially true as Goldman Sachs joins the parade of critics wondering whether generative AI is all its makers claim. Too much spending for too little benefit sounds like hard times and consolidation is on the way.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Snowflake Stock\n\nSnowflake made its reputation by offering tight integration with other tool vendors. This created a lot of partners, each with their own policies and many relied on third-party consultants to do their work. Yet Snowflake only began mandating two-factor authentication this month?\n\nThat\u2019s not the position you want to be in when the market is slowing, and your competitors include the Cloud Giants. My guess is Slootman still has a job to do and that is getting his investors out with their shirts on.\n\nThe near term outlook for this stock is grim. For investors\u2019 sake I hope it comes back.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in MSFT, AMZN, and NOW.

        "content": "While investing, identifying small-cap stocks with high growth potential can be a game-changer to maximize returns. Small-cap stocks often possess agility and growth prospects that larger companies may need help to match. Here, each is poised to deliver substantial returns on investment.\n\nThese companies represent diverse sectors \u2014 from technology solutions to digital advertising \u2014 but share a common thread: a strategic focus on robust revenue growth and innovative market strategies. Understanding these companies\u2019 unique market leads and financial strengths provides a larger perspective on their current opportunities and anticipates growth potential.\n\nSmall-cap stocks offer an edge to capitalize on emerging trends and disruptive technologies. For instance, the first company leverages its expertise in educational staffing services. Meanwhile, the second one expands its automation solutions with\u00a0solid\u00a0customer retention. Finally, the third company capitalizes on digital advertising shifts. These companies\u2019 fundamentals and market strategies can help in sharp investment decisions to amplify portfolio returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRCM Technologies (RCMT) A line of people holding resumes, as if at a staffing agency.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRCM Technologies (NASDAQ:RCMT) specializes in engineering consulting and staffing services. The company has a solid top-line growth trajectory, reflected by a 7.2% annual increase in revenue to $71.9 million for Q1 2024. This growth is bolstered by strong performances across its segments, particularly in engineering, where gross profit surged by an impressive 27.1%. Such substantial growth in the engineering segment indicates effective project execution and likely higher-margin contracts, contributing significantly to overall revenue expansion.\n\nRegarding profitability, RCM Technologies\u2019s adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.1% annually to\u00a0$6.8 million for Q1 2024, while adjusted diluted EPS saw a substantial increase of 30.4% to $0.53 per share. These metrics highlight the company\u2019s sharp cost controls that may lead to sustained growth momentum. Strategically, RCM Technologies has focused on expanding its market footprint, particularly in the K\u201312 education sector. The company reported 19.1% revenue growth in school districts served, reflecting successful onboarding of new clients and effective management of existing relationships.\n\nRCM Technologies\u2019 strong revenue growth in niche markets makes it a top mark on small-cap stocks with a high potential list.\n\nUiPath (PATH) Mobile phone with web page of software development company UiPath Inc. on display in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of cellphone screen. Unmodified photo. PATH stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) leads in robotic process automation (RPA) across industries. The company derived a 21% annual annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth to $1.508 billion for Q1 fiscal 2025. This growth is driven by a net new ARR of $44 million, excluding an FX headwind of $3 million. The consistent growth in ARR indicates strong customer retention and expansion. Moreover, UiPath ended the quarter with approximately 10,800 customers, highlighting its broad customer base. Significant growth in customers with higher ARR tiers, such as $1 million or more and $5 million or more, demonstrates scalability and deepens customer relationships.\n\nFurther, UiPath\u2019s revenue grew\u00a016% annually. Despite challenges in large multi-year deals, UiPath\u2019s revenue growth marks high market demand and operational scale. UiPath maintained a solid gross margin of 86%, with software gross margin at 90%, indicating efficient cost management and scalability in its cloud operations. Products like Autopilot have garnered significant customer interest, with over 1,500 organizations using them.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates strong market acceptance and the potential for rapid adoption, accelerating customer time-to-value.\n\nTo sum up, UiPath stands out among small-cap stocks with a high potential list due to its rapid growth in ARR and progressive button line.\n\nPerion Network (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion Network (NASDAQ:PERI) specializes in digital advertising and programmatic platforms. The company\u2019s trends fluctuate due to external factors, such as changes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing\u2019s pricing strategies. Despite challenges, Perion\u2019s consolidated top line grew 9% annually to $157.8 million in Q1 2024. This growth is primarily attributed to the sharp performance of newer growth engines. Similarly, retail Media Solutions grew 134% annually to $14.9 million, constituting 20% of the advertising solutions revenue.\n\nAdditionally, connected TV (CTV) advertising revenue surged 108% annually to $8.2 million.\u00a0This\u00a0highlights strong customer adoption of high-impact CTV solutions. Digital out-of-home advertising revenue increased by 25% annually to $9.7 million, driven by the strategic acquisition of HiveStack.\u00a0Indeed, these growth engines collectively mitigate the impact of declines in other areas, like video advertising, reflecting Perion\u2019s ability to capitalize on emerging digital advertising trends. At its core, SORT 2.0, an upgraded AI-based audience segmentation technology, extends its capabilities beyond the web to CTV.\n\nPerion\u2019s successful diversification beyond traditional search advertising derives substantial revenue growth and market share expansion, making it a solid choice among top small-cap stocks with high potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Google deal for 'hot market' cyber firm Wiz would bolster cloud security",
        "content": "By Zeba Siddiqui\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If Alphabet's Google is successful in its effort to buy cloud security company Wiz, it would bolster its cloud security offerings for large organisations, a hotspot for hackers, and help it take on cloud rivals Amazon.com and Microsoft, experts said.\n\nAlphabet is in advanced talks to acquire Wiz, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in an up to $23 billion deal that would be Google's most expensive acquisition and provide it with cybersecurity products that defend against ransomware gangs wreaking havoc on large enterprises.\n\n\"There is a hot market for cloud security,\" said Jerome Seguera, a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm MalwareBytes, adding that Wiz gives customers \"great visibility into their assets in a straightforward way.\"\n\nWiz offers tools that allow organisations to scan their entire infrastructure and specific software for threats.\n\nGoogle has been steadily expanding its cybersecurity offerings in recent years. Two years ago it bought the popular cyber firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion.\n\n\"I think they are trying to compete with Microsoft and to a smaller extent AWS (Amazon Web Services),\" said Marc Bleicher, chief technology officer of the security firm Surefire Cyber.\n\n\"Wiz is one of only a few who address a big chunk of the cloud security market in one platform,\" Bleicher said.\n\nWiz was founded in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, primed to benefit from the move towards remote work and the shift by organisations to cloud environments from desktops. Most large organisations have also shifted to storing their data on the cloud over the years, but that has come with security risks - especially as companies expand and become more complex.\n\nIts founders, former Israeli army intelligence members, earlier founded another cloud security firm named Adallom that Microsoft bought for $320 million in 2015.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, the company has grown rapidly since then. Only two months ago, at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francsico, Wiz said it was valued at $12 billion. It now expects annual organic revenue of $1 billion in 2025 and has raised nearly $2 billion in venture capital investment in total, said a person familiar with the Google deal talks, declining to be named.\n\nThe Wiz buyout talks come as the pace of global dealmaking in cybersecurity has significantly picked up in 2024. There were 120 global cybersecurity deals announced in the first half of this year, accounting for $12.4 billion in deal value, compared to 137 such deals last year, or $4.8 billion in deal value, according to data from the financial information firm Dealogic.\n\nStory continues\n\nDave Dewalt, founder of the cyber-focused venture capital firm NightDragon, said Wiz's growth is the result of strong marketing and being \"at the right place, at the right time, with the right product.\"\n\nDeWalt, former chief executive of cybersecurity firm FireEye, said cloud security is the most important and fastest-growing part of cybersecurity, driven by increasing attacks on large organisations.\n\n\"The stakes are exponentially higher in the cloud. So therefore, the security needs to be exponentially stronger, and (there's) more revenue from it,\" he said, adding that Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike had also beefed up their cloud security offerings in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco, James Pearson in London, Milana Vinn in NEW YORK, and Krystal Hu in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders and Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term that describes seven of the world's largest tech companies, many of which have been among the best-performing stocks over the past few years. The companies are Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nEach Magnificent Seven company is an industry leader in its own right and at the forefront of many innovations. However, the following three companies stand as particularly good buys in July and going forward. If you're looking for tech stocks with appealing growth opportunities to add to your portfolio, they're well worth considering.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nNvidia's stock surge over the past two years has gotten a lot of attention (rightfully so), but Microsoft has also experienced significant growth. It's the second-best performing Magnificent Seven stock over the past three years and up over 22% in 2024 (as of July 12).\n\nA lot has been said about the rising valuations of big tech companies, and many of them are warranted. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 39, Microsoft is expensive by virtually all standards, leaving it susceptible to a market correction. MSFT PE Ratio Chart\n\nThankfully, the one thing Microsoft has going for it that other Magnificent Seven stocks don't is the vast ecosystem it has developed through the years. And it's not just the ecosystem, it's the customers that Microsoft serves in this ecosystem: other businesses.\n\nCountless businesses globally count on Microsoft's products and services to run their businesses. Between PCs, Office software, cloud service Azure, and recruiting hub LinkedIn, Microsoft has its hand in multiple crucial enterprise-focused industries.\n\nThis helps shield it a bit against downturns because it's not as easy for businesses to abandon Microsoft's services or products as it is for consumers of other tech companies. By no means does it make Microsoft a foolproof investment, but you can almost be certain of its long-term stability and growth trajectory. If its valuation worries you, I'd recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDespite surging over 34% this year, Alphabet still seems like a bargain compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to market dominance, there may not be a more clear example than Google's search business. Google search has around a 90% market share globally, and it's maintained this dominance for quite some time. And although you never want to make assumptions, it's safe to assume it'll continue this dominance for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts leadership position in search has led to a bustling advertising business. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, Google advertising generated $61.7 billion in revenue, with Google search specifically bringing in $46.2 billion. Google advertising accounted for over 78% of Alphabet's revenue in Q1 and was up 13% year over year. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAdvertising will continue to keep Alphabet's lights on, but the growth of its cloud platform, Google Cloud, shouldn't be overlooked. Google Cloud has turned the corner on profitability, and in Q1, its operating income (profit from its core operations) grew 371% to $900 million.\n\nWith a dominant search business, a fast-growing cloud business, and a newly announced dividend ($0.20 quarterly), Alphabet is in a great position for sustained long-term growth.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon became the company it is today because of its e-commerce business, but it has done a great job at branching out and ensuring its business isn't too dependent on just that segment.\n\nHaving the foresight to see the role cloud services would eventually play has worked wonders for Amazon and its bottom line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud computing, with a lead it should manage to hold on to for a while, barring a major competitive disruption.\n\nIn Q1, AWS generated just over 17% of Amazon's revenue but over 61% of its operating income. Cloud computing is a much higher-margin business than e-commerce, so its growth will continue to boost Amazon's profitability. Add in the emerging AI innovations, and AWS is becoming a one-stop shop for cloud and AI solutions.\n\nAmazon has spent billions building out its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure, and it's now at the point where it can leverage these investments to generate new revenue streams. Take Supply Chain by Amazon, for example, an end-to-end set of supply chain services that allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's logistics network.\n\nAmazon is a company built for sustained growth, and investors can feel confident holding on to it for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

The move came as Apple was seen as lagging behind Alphabet's (GOOG) Google and Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI in the AI race.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey added that Apple could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. The investment bank previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years and raised its price target to $273 from $216 based on the new projections.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 and European markets fall after Powell teases 'confidence' in inflation data\n\nThe stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to London Stock Exchange data.\n\nApple stock has risen more than 26% year to date and over 8% in the last month.\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nOcado said losses narrowed significantly in the latest six-month period, as it lifted its forecasts on signs that demand for online deliveries was picking up again.\n\nThe group reported a \u00a3154m ($199.7m) pre-tax loss for the six months to 2 June against losses of \u00a3290m a year ago.\n\nIt notched up revenues of \u00a31.54bn for the first half, boosted by a 21.8% surge in its technology solutions business, which powers online grocery businesses and automated warehouses for other retailers.\n\nOcado retail \u2014 run as a joint venture with Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) \u2014 saw revenues rise 11.3%, helping the division swing to underlying earnings of \u00a320.7m from a \u00a32.5m loss a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nOcado has shifted its focus in the last few years to providing B2B robotics and automation services, with some suggesting it could spin out the retail business to focus solely on tech.\n\n\u201cWe have come through an unprecedented period for online grocery, with multiple years of high food inflation following a surge in demand during the pandemic. The global channel shift to online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado Group, said.\n\nOcado said it was raising its profit and cash flow guidance for the full year.\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nCartier owner Richemont reported a small drop in sales for its fiscal first quarter amid slowing demand for luxury goods, with a slump in Chinese demand pushing the overall result slightly below expectations.\n\nRichemont, which also owns brands including Van Cleef & Arpel, said sales were down 27% in the Greater China region in the three months to the end of June.\n\nThe slump was partially offset by stronger jewellery sales in other countries, with overall sales up 1% at constant exchange rates.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Anglo American, Burberry, TSMC and Netflix\n\n\u201cThe decline reflected both the low level of consumer confidence and the strong comparatives ranging from double-digit growth in the mainland to triple digits in Hong Kong and Macau over the prior-year period,\u201d Richemont said.\n\nFor the period ending 30 June, the luxury-goods group booked sales of \u20ac5.27bn (\u00a34.42bn, $5.74bn), compared with \u20ac5.32bn in the prior-year period. The result came broadly in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts of \u20ac5.28bn, according to a poll of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMining firm Rio Tinto\u2019s London-listed shares fell after it reported second-quarter iron ore shipments below analyst estimates.\n\nIron ore production from the group\u2019s Pilbara assets in Western Australia came in at 79.5 million tonnes, 2% lower than the same period.\n\nRio said productivity gains offset ore depletion but that production and shipping in the quarter were impacted by a train collision in mid-May, which resulted in around six days of lost rail capacity and full stockpiles at some mines.\n\nThe firm's report comes as hopes for more stimulus in China have helped iron ore prices rebound recently after weak demand from the country's construction sector led to a dull first half.\n\n\"The (Chinese) government has provided additional measures for the property market to destock the large inventory overhang,\" Rio said on Tuesday.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Rises Yet Lags Behind Market: Some Facts Worth Knowing",
        "content": "In the latest market close, Microsoft (MSFT) reached $453.96, with a +0.09% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.53%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.4%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 2.48% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Microsoft will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.90, reflecting a 7.81% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $64.16 billion, reflecting a 14.19% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Right now, Microsoft possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Microsoft has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.41 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.81.\n\nAlso, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.14. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Software industry stood at 2.49 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 102, finds itself in the top 41% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Monday, July 15, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), as well as a micro-cap stock Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (TTSH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, we now have Q2 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and only 44.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe one notable feature of this admittedly small and Finance-heavy sample of results is the very small proportion of the companies that are able to beat revenue estimates. The 44.8% revenue beats percentage compares to 69% for the same group of 29 S&P 500 members in the preceding quarter (2024 Q1) and is a low for the preceding 20 quarters.\n\nWe will be watching closely how the revenue beats percentage unfolds in the days ahead as we move into the heart of the Q2 earnings season.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have Q2 results from 20.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total Q2 earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Finance sector's EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking above the 20-quarter averages for this group of sector companies.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.4% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +25.9%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. \r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+62.7% vs. +24.2%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Its new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends. \r\n\r\nLilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. \r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares were in line with the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+5.6% vs. +5.5%). The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. UnitedHealth\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. \r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend. \r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Tile Shop have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +10.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $320.59 million has a strong financial health, with zero long-term debt and $24 million in cash as of first-quarter 2024. This positions the company to invest in growth and weather economic fluctuations. \r\n\r\nGross margins improved to 65.8% due to lower freight and product costs, reflecting effective cost management. Expansion of product lines, including new luxury vinyl tile (LVT) lines, enhances revenue diversification. E-commerce sales growth reflects a strategic shift to capture online markets. Effective cost management led to a 5.5% decline in SG&A expenses. \r\n\r\nYet, challenges include a 10.2% fall in comparable store sales, weak macroeconomic conditions, high SG&A expenses, inventory management issues and potential margin pressures. Dependence on professional customers, stiff competition and limited store footprint growth are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Infosys Limited (INFY) and McKesson Corporation (MCK).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Microsoft's MSFT recent $1.5 billion investment in G42, a UAE-based artificial intelligence (AI) firm, has drawn the attention of Republican lawmakers, who are calling for a thorough intelligence assessment of the deal.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul and John Moolenaar, leaders of key House committees, have requested a briefing from the Biden administration, citing concerns over the potential transfer of sensitive technology and G42's historical ties to China.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers are particularly worried about the deal's second phase, which could involve the transfer of export-restricted semiconductor chips and sophisticated AI model weights, crucial components that enhance an AI model's capacity to mimic human reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis request underscores growing apprehensions about the lack of regulations governing the export of advanced AI technologies, with fears that companies like G42 might share this prized technology with U.S. adversaries, particularly China.\r\n\r\nIn their letter to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, the Republican representatives expressed deep concern about the rapid advancement of a partnership involving \"the unprecedented transfer of highly sensitive, U.S.-origin technology, without congressional consultation or clearly defined regulations in place.\" They specifically requested an assessment of G42's ties to China's Communist Party, military and government before the Microsoft deal progresses further.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers' concerns were further fueled by a recent visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Beijing, reportedly to discuss AI cooperation. This diplomatic engagement has heightened anxieties about potential technology transfers to China, a country with which the U.S. has increasingly strained relations in the tech sector.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has responded to these concerns, stating that it is working closely with the U.S. government and that \"U.S. national security will continue to be a principal priority.\" The White House National Security Council has also indicated its commitment to ongoing dialogue with lawmakers regarding the risks associated with digital infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAdding another layer of complexity to the situation, G42's past involvement in \"digital surveillance\" work and alleged connections to Emirati cybersecurity firm DarkMatter have been cited as areas of possible risk. These concerns highlight the intricate web of international relationships and potential security implications surrounding the deal.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, G42 announced in February that it had divested its investments in China and accepted constraints imposed by the United States to work with U.S. companies. This move, along with reports that the Microsoft-G42 deal was largely orchestrated by the Biden administration to limit China's influence, presents a complex picture of competing interests and strategic maneuvers in the global AI landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Navigates Cloud Antitrust Concerns Amid Regulatory Challenges\n\nAs this situation unfolds, it underscores the delicate balance that must be struck between fostering technological innovation, maintaining international partnerships and safeguarding national security interests. The outcome of this congressional inquiry and any subsequent actions could have far-reaching implications for future international AI collaborations and the regulatory framework surrounding AI technology exports.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft continues to face regulatory scrutiny on multiple fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. In response, Microsoft has relinquished its board observer seat at OpenAI to alleviate antitrust concerns in the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nRecent legal challenges include a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over alleged discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. Additionally, the EU has accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its business software.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has successfully resolved a potential European Union antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices by reaching an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon-backed trade association. This settlement comes after Microsoft made several concessions to address concerns raised by cloud service providers, effectively ending a prolonged dispute. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of MSFT have gained 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 31%.\r\n\r\nWhile the CISPE agreement marks progress, it has drawn criticism from major players like Amazon AMZN-based Amazon Web Services, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba BABA cloud service, who were not included in the settlement. These companies argue that the agreement fails to address the needs of most Microsoft customers who still face restrictions in choosing their preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAs the tech industry evolves, Microsoft's ability to navigate these regulatory challenges will be crucial in shaping its future and the competitive landscape of the global tech market.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Micro-Sized Mavericks With Mega-Sized Potential",
        "content": "The tech run that we have been experiencing came under some pressure on Thursday with FAANG stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others pulling back as traders rotated out of large caps and into small-cap stocks, as reported by Investopedia. The article went on to say that this rotation was mainly because of the expectations that the Federal Reserve will move to reduce the interest rates this year and this would definitely be beneficial for micro-cap stocks, as it may improve their risk profiles.\n\nOver the past couple of years, thanks to a boom in AI spending and investment, micro-cap stocks have left somewhat out of the picture, with indices like the Russell 2000 index gaining only 38.79% over the past five years to the Nasdaq\u2019s 125.85%. Broadly, I believe that these micro-cap stocks could be seen as undervalued on a systematic basis, which gives them huge potential for investors.\n\nSo here are three micro-cap stocks for investors to consider buying amid these market developments and projections.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackSky Technology (BKSY) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nBlackSky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) is an interesting but quite a risky investment. Still, there is no gain without a proportionate amount of risk to take on, and BKSY is one of those hot, micro-cap stocks that could become a multibagger.\n\nThe thesis for BKSY hinges on the planned launch of next generation Gen-3 satellites, which could be a game changer given that the enhanced imaging could lead to new applications and acquisition of new clients.\n\nHowever, BKSY does have some weaknesses. Its\u00a0crucial problem is profitability \u2014 or the lack thereof. Although there is an increase in adjusted EBITDA, BlackSky remains to have significant GAAP losses and negative free cash flow because of the high operating costs and capital investments.\n\nStill, the satellite technology has a unique competitive advantage in that it allows customers to \u201ccapture and quickly deliver large volumes of dawn-to-dusk, time-diverse imagery [that] increases transparency into strategic defense and economic activities which could otherwise have gone unnoticed.\u201d\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock. micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nAs an investor, I must say that I am quite bullish on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). I do agree that the company has gone through some difficulties in the past but I think that the recent events have greatly improved the company\u2019s position.\n\nThe major development is that Plug Power has at last got a conditional $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy in May. This is a great endorsement to the company\u2019s technology and the future business expansion plans. Of course there are some steps that they have to overcome in order to get the actual money, but the fact that the Department of Energy is ready to invest such a large amount is already a big plus.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen analyzing the recent financials, there is still much to do and improve in terms of profitability. However, the company is clearly progressing \u2014 service and fueling margins are growing and the company has managed to control cash outlay quite effectively. With the new capital they can raise, I think they have a decent chance of reaching self-sustaining free cash flow in the next three to five years, which would be supported by a capital raise. This then makes it one of those micro-cap stocks with great potential.\n\nTurtle Beach (HEAR) micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am quite enthusiastic about the current happenings at Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR). This renowned gaming accessories firm has recently acquired something that I feel will allow it to expand and become profitable in the future.\n\nIn my opinion the $118 million deal to acquirePerformance Designed Products is a big deal. Performance Designed Products is a key rival particularly in the controller category, thus adding them to the company\u2019s product line and market presence enhances the company\u2019s standing.\n\nHowever, the complementarities expected from this deal are quite handsome as well. The company expects to achieve cost synergies of $11 million and there could be revenue synergies as well given their combined scale and distribution reach. This should help in increasing the profitability of the company greatly.\n\nAmid the announcement, HEAR has also courted the attention of some Wall Street analysts, despite having a market cap of just $300 million. Within the next twelve months, HEAR is expected to post positive accounting profits, as it has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14x. These factors combined then makes it one of those micro-cap stocks with immense potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in NVDA.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups. He then started writing about Australian and U.S. equities for various publications. His work has appeared in MarketBeat, FXStreet, Cryptoslate, Seeking Alpha, and the New Scientist magazine, among others.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS. Image source: Apple.\n\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\n\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\n\nThe key differences between these tech titans\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\n\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\n\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\n\nAll three tech giants are growing faster than Apple\n\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Estimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Current Market Capitalization Price-to-Sales Ratio (Forward) Apple 5% 10% $3.57 billion 9 Nvidia 46% 53% $3.26 billion 28 Microsoft 15% 17% $3.47 billion 14 Alphabet 11% 20% $2.37 billion 7\n\nData source: MarketScreener.\n\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\n\nBut look beyond the market caps\n\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. is in talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up \u201924 Race BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw Trump\u2019s Bloodied, Defiant Image After Shooting Pumps Up His Base\n\nThe transaction could total as much as $23 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. That would make it the tech giant\u2019s largest acquisition to date.\n\nAn agreement hasn\u2019t been reached and talks could still end without one, the person said.\n\nA representative for Alphabet didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Wiz declined to comment. The talks were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe talks come on the heels of Alphabet shelving efforts to acquire customer relationship management company HubSpot Inc., which Bloomberg News reported last week. As was the case with the HubSpot deal, a potential acquisition as large as that of Wiz is unusual for a big tech company like Alphabet, given the heightened scrutiny that the company faces by antitrust regulators.\n\nGoogle already faces several antitrust challenges, including a lawsuit by the US Justice Department accusing it of abusing its dominant position in online search and another one regarding its digital advertising tools.\n\nAlphabet has been ramping up its investment in its cloud customer business, including offering more generative artificial intelligence tools for clients. Though Google still lags behind Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the market for cloud computing, the company reported that its cloud unit has been profitable in consecutive quarters, after years of the unit being a money-losing operation.\n\nAn acquisition of Wiz, a cloud and cybersecurity company, could help Google catch up to Microsoft and Amazon in an increasingly competitive cloud market.\n\nAs more startups are moving their apps and data to the cloud, the opportunity in the sector is growing, particularly as generative AI apps and tools continue to gain traction. Such tools often require enormous data sets to be uploaded to the cloud that AI models can train on, in order for them to be able to generate output like images, marketing campaigns or software code, based on what users prompt the generative AI software with.\n\nNew York-based Wiz connects to cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and identifies and scans data stored in the cloud, looking for and removing security risks. The company, founded in 2020, was valued at $12 billion during a May funding round that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Alphabet deal for Wiz would follow its $5.4 billion purchase of cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. in 2022. That was the company\u2019s second-largest acquisition, topped only by its deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC completed in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Liana Baker and Ryan Gould.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cloud computing makes it easier for companies and consumers to store data and become more efficient. Also, it more affordable to use cloud providers than it is to invest in the hardware which needs management. These benefits have resulted in a multi-year boom that isn\u2019t slowing down.\n\nThe cloud computing industry has a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% through 2031. Artificial intelligence (AI) should keep growth rates elevated since AI tools rely on cloud platforms to process large amounts of data.\n\nMany tech giants have positioned themselves to benefit from the booming cloud industry. In addition, these same corporations have trounced the S&P 500 over the past five years and look ready to extend their rallies. High revenue and net income growth are key components for each of these cloud stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWondering which sky-high cloud stocks can take your portfolio higher? These are some of the top picks that can reward patient investors in the long run.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up by 8% year-to-date (YTD) and has delivered a 146% gain over the past five years. The cloud platform features rising revenue and net profit margins. Luckily for long-term investors, it\u2019s also feeling the heat from a bearish analyst.\n\nA Guggenheim analyst warned that generative AI revenue may not grow as quickly as anticipated. It\u2019s possible, according to the bearish call, that this catalyst won\u2019t come to fruition until 2025. ServiceNow is still rated as a strong buy with a projected 15% upside, so most analysts are still bullish.\n\nThe bearish call has resulted in a sharp drop that presents a buy-the-dip opportunity. A look at recent earnings highlights the long-term potential. ServiceNow reported 24% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the first quarter and raised its full-year guidance. Net income more than doubled YOY to reach $347 million. NOW has a 98% renewal rate among 8,100 customers. And some of them pay more than $1 million per year to use the company\u2019s cloud platform. Therefore, ServiceNow looks ready to deliver long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the largest market share in the cloud computing industry. The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes up roughly one-third of the total market, and it\u2019s growth is accelerating. The tech giant reported 13% YOY net sales growth across its business. AWS stood out with 17% YOY growth, bringing in $25.0 billion in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Amazon isn\u2019t just winning in the cloud computing industry. Also, it is leading the way in e-commerce, advertising, groceries, streaming and other verticals. Each of these segments allows Amazon to show up in front of more consumers. It\u2019s certainly been showing up for investors.\n\nCurrently, Amazon stock is up by 33% YTD and have roughly doubled over the past five years. Wall Street analysts believe that the stock has more room to run. The average price target suggests an 11% upside for the consensus strong buy stock. The highest price target of $246 per share indicates that the stock can gain 23% from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Minesweeper game with bombs and exploded frowny face, classic Microsoft computer game\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/tomeqs\n\nThe second-largest cloud provider, Microsoft\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud services are growing at a faster rate than Amazon\u2019s. Microsoft Cloud generated $35.1 billion in Q3 of fiscal year 2024 which was 23% higher than the same period last year. AI is fueling more demand for the company\u2019s cloud platform.\n\nThe tech conglomerate as a whole reported 17% YOY revenue growth and 20% YOY net income growth. And, MSFT rewarded shareholders with some of its profits. The company poured $8.4 billion into share repurchases and dividends in the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a 40 P/E ratio and has a 0.65% yield. Shares are up by 24% YTD and have gained 232% over the past five years. It\u2019s a core component of the S&P 500 and most funds in general. Wall Street analysts believe there\u2019s more upside to the stock and have rated it as a strong buy. The average price target suggests a 9% gain from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NOW, AMZN, and MSFT.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for about $23 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. If the deal is finalized, it will be the company\u2019s largest ever acquisition.\n\nThe news comes days after reports surfaced that Alphabet has decided not to pursue an acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE: NYSE:HUBS), a company with a market cap of over $24 billion. Antitrust scrutiny was said to have played a part in the company\u2019s decision not to acquire HubSpot.\n\nWiz posted annual recurring revenue of $350 million in 2023, up from $100 million in its first 18 months after its founding in 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport.\n\nThe company raised $1 billion earlier this year at a valuation of $12 billion, suggesting the takeover is nearly double from those levels. Wiz is backed by venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nWiz was one of the rare startups outside of AI to raise capital at a higher valuation in 2024. Many startups are suffering from a tech boom hangover fueled by the low-interest rate environment.\n\nIf a deal is completed, it would be nearly double the value of Google\u2019s largest deal to date, a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Meanwhile, its second-largest acquisition to date was a $5.4 billion purchase of another security company, Mandiant.\n\nCommenting on the possible deal, Wedbush analysts said this would be a \"shot across the bow at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\"\n\n\"For Google this would be a shot across the bow at Microsoft and Amazon making a major bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship GCP offering in the cloud,\" the Wedbush analyst stated. \"This would give Google an edge on a number of cloud deployments and further monetize the cyber security cloud space with still less than 50% of the workloads not on the cloud globally.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle near deal to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for $23 billion - WSJ\n\nTSMC second-quarter profit seen jumping 30% on surging AI chip demand\n\nPro Research: Wall Street dives into Regeneron's robust prospects\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the biggest technology disappointment of the century, so far, but it\u2019s still the most important tech company of this decade. Some are saying now is the time to buy Intel stock.\n\nIntel\u2019s failures over two decades came under a series of marketing executives. Its rise, if it is to happen, will be because of Pat Gelsinger. He\u2019s a manufacturing executive who started his career at Intel but was at VMWare when he was called back in early 2020. He understands fabrication.\n\nFabrication and Intel Stock\n\nGelsinger\u2019s strategy is to rebuild Intel as an American chip manufacturer, with new \u201cfabs\u201d in Ohio and Arizona, and substantial government help. Since he took command in February 2020, the stock has lost almost half its value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGelsinger is putting $100 billion into his foundry plan over five years. Your tax dollars represent $8.5 billion of that. He says the company\u2019s goal is to have half the world\u2019s most advanced chips produced in the U.S. or Europe by the end of the decade.\n\nIntel moved its manufacturing offshore during the 20th century, most notably to China, because it was cheaper. Chinese workers earned less. China\u2019s environmental regulation was lax, and local protests easily ignored.\n\nIntel Foundry will have higher running costs, and Gelsinger will still hand off work to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) when necessary.\n\nIntel\u2019s Arrow Lake processors, due later this year, will have circuit lines just 2 nanometers apart. Intel calls this distance \u201c20 Angstroms,\u201d and plans to hit 18 Angstroms next year. In 2026 it hopes to reach 14 Angstroms.\n\nThe promise of this approach can be seen in the success of Taiwan Semiconductor, now best known for making Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. TSMC\u2019s stock is up 86% this year, 358% over the last five years, and it\u2019s now worth nearly 7 times Intel. Its market cap briefly touched $1 trillion recently before falling back.\n\nThe Bear Thesis\n\nIt\u2019s on the design side of chip making that Intel is getting killed.\n\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is licensing its Intel-compatible CPU design to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nNvidia is also licensing ARM technology for a gaming CPU, due out next year. Even if that chip is made at an Intel foundry, most of its value will be in the software.\n\nIntel still has four-fifths of the CPU market. It\u2019s hard to see that continuing in the face of the multi-ARM race that\u2019s coming.\n\nIntel should easily reach $55 billion in sales this year. But it had $79 billion in sales when Gelsinger took over. Profits are down 80% and the company is expected to earn just $1.01 per share this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two reasons why some analysts are putting Intel back on their buy lists. First is the expectation that those new foundries will soon generate a return. Second is its relative valuation, now just over twice sales, at a time when TSMC is selling for nearly 25 times sales and the AI tide keeps rising.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvestors have been sitting on losses in Intel for years now.\n\nAnalysts who, like me, have bought Gelsinger\u2019s promises, counseled patience, and bet on the foundry plan look very stupid right now.\n\nBut Intel is, as I\u2019ve said, the most essential company in the U.S.. If Intel can\u2019t make the foundry work, America\u2019s hopes of regaining the semiconductor market will go with it. So will a lot of your tax dollars.\n\nBut I\u2019m past taking promises at face value. Intel is running out of time. At TipRanks the professional analysts have mostly moved on. At Stocktwits, traders are neutral.\n\nIf Gelsinger can\u2019t get some profits out of the foundry soon, maybe it\u2019s time to sell out to the Chinese. If he can, watch out, because right now no one believes it.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in NVDA, TSM and INTC.

        "title": "These 3 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks Make Up 24% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's My Top Pick.",
        "content": "Created in 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the best-known U.S. indexes. It is price-weighted, meaning its 30 components are weighted based on their stock prices rather than their market caps. This means that stock splits can have a major impact on the Dow.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH), and Goldman Sachs Group(NYSE: GS) are the three largest Dow components and all trade at over $460 a share. Together, they make up roughly 24% of the Dow,\u00a0whereas the average component holds a mere 3.3% weighting.\n\nAll three companies operate in vastly different industries but pay stable and growing dividends. Here's why Microsoft is my favorite pick out of the three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIts broad-based exposure to growth\n\nThe simplest reason to buy and hold Microsoft is its exposure to trends and its leadership across industries. The company is a top player in cloud infrastructure, software and hardware for commercial customers and individual consumers, developer tools, enterprise software, and more.\n\nMicrosoft has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) across its business. The company's generative AI tool, Copilot, probably has been the biggest update in the history of its Office 365 suite of software. Azure AI helps developers build intelligent cloud-native applications on the Azure platform.\n\nWhile other companies believe AI will help them accelerate growth in the future, Microsoft is already seeing significant profitability improvements across its business. It is a proven winner in AI, which is why it deserves a higher valuation than its historical average. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSince operating income is growing even faster than revenue, Microsoft's margins are hovering around 10-year highs, while sales have roughly doubled in the last five years. If it sustains impressive growth, it could help the company reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nMaintaining industry leadership\n\nIndustry-leading companies that can continue to grow can be great investments. But the tech sector is chock-full of great businesses that either no longer exist, were bought out on the cheap, or are a shell of what they used to be. That's why companies must invest in research and development and continue innovating.\n\nWhen I look at the mega-cap tech companies, Microsoft stands out as offering the best balance between stability and innovation.\n\nFor example, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is a significantly less expensive stock than Microsoft, but its business model is more fragile. Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. YouTube is a powerhouse, but ChatGPT, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram are challenging Google's impenetrable moat in search. So while Alphabet is cheaper today, slower earnings growth could make it more expensive than Microsoft in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn sum, being more cautious when calling a company a surefire bet in tech is important. For stodgy companies like Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, the name of the game is to sustain quality brands, develop a pipeline of new products, and make savvy acquisitions.\n\nBut tech companies have to manage capital well and innovate. BlackBerry lost to Apple because it failed to pivot away from buttons to the touch screen. AOL faded into history when broadband replaced dial-up internet. The list goes on and on.\n\nMicrosoft not only has the diversification needed to take a market share hit in one of its business units, but it is also a proven innovator and excellent capital allocator that has been on the right side of the AI-led movement in tech.\n\nIts massive capital return program\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend every year since fiscal 2011. At the time, it paid a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend. Today, the dividend is $0.75 per share -- a nearly fivefold increase in just 14 years.\n\nMicrosoft's decision to consistently raise its dividend is a testament to its confidence that it can continue to grow earnings. With over $21 billion in trailing-12-month dividend expenses, it pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company (by far).\n\nAnd that's not all: Microsoft also buys back a ton of its own stock. Over the last 12 months, it has repurchased $16.8 billion of its stock compared to $10.5 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nDue to its size and the tech industry's habit of rewarding employees with stock, Microsoft has to buy back at least as much stock as it pays in stock-based compensation to avoid diluting existing shareholders. It has been no easy challenge, as the company's stock-based compensation expense has doubled over the last five years. MSFT Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nOverall, Microsoft has committed to its capital return program by making annual (and significant) dividend raises while avoiding increasing its share count. The payout only yields 0.6%, but that's because the stock has posted massive outsize gains. The dividend is up 477% over the last 15 years, but the stock is up 1,870%.\n\nFor the dividend yield to increase, the dividend has to grow faster than the stock price. Microsoft's last five dividend raises were all around 10%. So if the stock cools off, we could see the yield increase.\n\nEither way, Microsoft is an underrated dividend stock heavily committed to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIt deserves a premium valuation\n\nMicrosoft is arguably the best company in the world due to its current position, high-margin growth trajectory, and ability to fund a sizable dividend and stock-buyback programs with cash.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the stock is its 40.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 10-year median P/E of 30.6. However, Microsoft is a much better business now than in the past, especially given the growth of cloud infrastructure and the AI improvements across proven products.\n\nIn this regard, Microsoft's valuation is more reasonable than it appears at first glance. The company will have to maintain an impressive growth rate to keep this high multiple, but it has what it takes. Investors interested in quality companies, even at a premium price, should consider Microsoft now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\n\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Value Stock That is \u2018Money Machine\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nMicrosoft Corp Inc (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMSFT is one of the top members of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodoran called AI \u201cvalue\u201d stocks that have become \u201cmoney machines.\u201d In September last year, he said MSFT was one of the direct beneficiaries of AI and that\u2019s why \u201csome\u201d of its stock rally was \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a leading technology company specializing in software, hardware, cloud services, AI and digital applications, was one of the largest contributors during the quarter. The company continues to execute on a myriad of catalysts across its businesses, particularly within cloud\u2010based applications like Azure and platform\u2010based servicessuch as LinkedIn. For Azure, Microsoft detailed previously announced partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD to develop first\u2010party silicon chips and custom\u2010 designed infrastructure innovations, including its AI accelerator (Azure Maia) and CPU (Azure Cobalt). These advancements are part of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to enhance AI performance and efficiency within the Azure ecosystem. LinkedIn, which has more than doubled its membership to over one billion in the past four years, is expanding its revenue streams across subscriptions and advertising and increasingly disrupting traditional recruiting and training functions. LinkedIn recently passed $16 billion in run rate annual revenue, which is only ~7% of total Microsoft revenue, but if it were a standalone business, it would be in the top half of S&P 500 constituents! The Azure and LinkedIn examples are just two of many that illustrate Microsoft\u2019s ongoing transformation from an operating system to a total technology solutions provider.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July.

        "title": "Billionaire Hedge Fund Managers' 2 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (Hint: Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them)",
        "content": "\"Follow the money.\"\n\nThat phrase gained notoriety during the Watergate scandal five decades ago. However, it could be useful for investors today looking for stocks to buy.\n\nMuch of the big money has poured into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last two years. Nvidia has been an especially significant beneficiary of this trend, with its shares skyrocketing over 9x since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBut where would following the money lead investors now? Here are billionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks -- and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThe top hedge fund billionaires\n\nForbes ranked the wealthiest hedge fund managers of 2023. The top 10 were:\n\nRank Manager Hedge Fund Net Worth (as of 3/10/23) 1 Ken Griffin Citadel $35 billion 2 Jim Simons Renaissance Technologies $28.1 billion 3 Ray Dalio Bridgewater Associates $19.1 billion 4 David Tepper Appaloosa Management $18.5 billion 5 Steve Cohen Point72 Asset Management $17.5 billion 6 Carl Icahn Icahn Enterprises $17.5 billion 7 Michael Platt BlueCrest Capital Management $16 billion 8 Israel Englander Millennium Management $11.5 billion 9 Chase Coleman Tiger Global Management $8.5 billion 10 David Shaw D.E. Shaw & Co. $7.9 billion\n\nData source: Forbes.\n\nJim Simons has since passed away, although his Renaissance Technologies hedge fund remains active. The net worths of the other nine hedge fund managers have changed somewhat since last year, but they're all still multibillionaires.\n\nMost of these billionaire hedge fund managers have invested heavily in AI. Carl Icahn stands out as a notable exception. None of Icahn Enterprises' holdings are AI-related. Michael Platt's BlueCrest Capital also has no AI stocks among its top positions.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks\n\nHowever, two AI stocks, in particular, are arguably the favorites of the other billionaire hedge fund managers. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranked in the top five holdings of seven of the 10 richest hedge fund managers on Forbes' list based on their latest regulatory filings. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) wasn't too far behind, landing in the top five for half the 10 wealthiest hedge fund managers.\n\nSteve Cohen and Israel England like Amazon the most. The e-commerce and cloud services leader is the largest holding for Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and England's Millennium Management. Amazon is the second-largest holding for David Tepper's Appaloosa Management.\n\nMicrosoft ranks as the No. 1 position for David Shaw's D.E. Shaw & Co. It's the second-largest holding for Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management. And while the tech giant isn't Ken Griffin's biggest position for his Citadel fund, Microsoft is his top AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRunners up\n\nAlthough Nvidia wasn't one of billionaire hedge managers' top two favorite AI stocks, it was a close runner-up. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker was in the top five holdings for four of Forbes' 10 richest hedge fund managers. Perhaps surprisingly, though, Nvidia wasn't the No. 1 AI stock for any of them.\n\nMeta Platforms wasn't too far behind either. It ranked in the top five holdings for three of the individuals on Forbes' list. Meta is the largest position for Coleman's Tiger Global Management.\n\nShould you buy Amazon and Microsoft too?\n\nNo one should buy a stock only to follow in the footsteps of billionaire investors. However, I think Amazon and Microsoft have a lot going for them.\n\nAmazon is the world's largest cloud services provider. AI should provide a long-term tailwind for the company's Amazon Web Services unit. Amazon is also using AI extensively in its e-commerce operations to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\nMicrosoft continues to reap the rewards from its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products. The company is the second-largest cloud service provider and should benefit from the same AI tailwind as Amazon.\n\nAs customers continue to move to the cloud to build and deploy AI models, Amazon's and Microsoft's revenue and earnings should grow significantly. Share prices tend to rise with earnings growth over the long term. I view Amazon and Microsoft as great AI stocks to buy right now. Just follow the AI money.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Alibaba\n\nAt first glance, investors may find it puzzling that Appaloosa Management, the fund run by billionaire David Tepper, took a position in Alibaba. In 2022, the stock faced a delisting threat when the Chinese company resisted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see its internal financial audits because of its association with the Chinese Communist Party. Although the U.S. and China eventually resolved that issue, the tenuous relationship between the countries put tremendous pressure on the stock.\n\nAs a result of the turmoil, Alibaba's stock price fell to almost 20% less than its initial public offering (IPO) price from 10 years ago. This drop comes despite Alibaba's net income more than tripling over that time. That caused its P/E ratio to fall briefly into the single digits, and its current earnings multiple of 18 is far below any comparable conglomerate.\n\nWith the stock trading at a heavily discounted price, Tepper increased the size of his Alibaba position by more than 11,000% over the last year. The markets may vindicate this move over time. The stock price has remained steady so far this year, though it is down about 75% from its 2020 high.\n\nStill, if Alibaba can find a way to ease investor concerns, Tepper's fund and those who invest along with him could experience a significant payday as the stock finally prices in its growing profits.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been a top AI innovator since it introduced the technology to its Google Search platform in 2001. Nonetheless, AI investors soured on the stock when OpenAI introduced a vastly improved version of ChatGPT in early 2023, creating the impression that the Google parent was behind the curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors like Bill Ackman saw this as a buying opportunity, so much so that 13% of his Pershing Square portfolio is tied up in this stock. As late as the fourth quarter of 2022, Pershing Square did not own any Alphabet stock.\n\nBuying at the time Pershing Square did may have been the right move. More recently, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product, Google Gemini. It has also combined its AI research under the Google DeepMind umbrella. Considering its $108 billion in liquidity, it will likely buy any AI innovation it cannot invent in-house.\n\nAdditionally, despite perceptions, the stock has risen by around 60% over the last year, and its 29 P/E ratio makes it the most inexpensive company with a market cap above $2 trillion. That positions Alphabet to offer both safety and a higher likelihood of further gains.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe opportunity in Microsoft was of particular interest to Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of the Duquesne Family Office fund. He saw that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had returned the tech giant to prominence as a leader in cloud computing.\n\nSucceeding in the cloud today means leading in AI. Druckenmiller began buying shares at the low point of the 2022 bear market and increased the purchases as Microsoft's partnership with generative AI specialist OpenAI came to light. Now, it makes up around 11% of the Duquesne fund.\n\nThe company built on that deal, integrating search engine Bing with ChatGPT to better enable it to compete with Google Search. Additionally, it launched Copilot, an AI-powered chatbot that combines the ChatGPT large language model and Microsoft's tools to create deliverables on command through one's natural language.\n\nAmid its innovations, it holds around $80 billion in liquidity, giving it tremendous optionality. Indeed, optimism around AI has helped Microsoft stock rise by nearly 40% over the last year.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of about 39, Microsoft has become a moderately valued AI stock, but given its resources and leadership in AI, the stock should continue to rise over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks Paving Your Path to Seven-Figure Wealth",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has triggered a multi-year investment cycle across the enterprise. Additionally, generative AI is now permeating various consumer internet applications. These trends bode well for AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2024, a huge moment of clarity appeared on AI spending as cloud service providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, it was a stark reminder of the heavy investment needed to make AI applications and products a reality. Bank of America projects capex for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon will increase by $37 billion in 2024 to $145 billion.\n\nMoreover, according to Capital Group, big tech giants are raising their capital expenditure budgets and will spend an estimated $500 billion over the next three years. This spending will go toward chips, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Plus, a substantial proportion will cover memory, servers and network equipment. This means more profits will flow to these three AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustom ASICs have emerged as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100 and B200 GPUs. After Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is the second-largest player in this fast-growing high-end market, with a 13-15% share.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are bullish on Marvell Technology as one of the AI wealth-building stocks to buy. They forecast that the high-end ASIC market will grow to between $20 and $30 billion. Additionally, due to demand from generative AI, this market will grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBuoyed by this growth, the company\u2019s AI revenues could skyrocket. Notably, the chip maker is working with various big tech companies on custom silicon. It has been collaborating with Google on its 5-nanometer Axion ARM CPU chip and Amazon on its 5-nanometer Tranium chip. Additionally, rumors are buzzing that it\u2019s working with Microsoft on its Maia chip and Amazon on its Inferentia chip.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, JPMorgan analysts think MRVL could generate $1.6 to $1.8 billion in revenues from networking and custom ASICs this year. Moreover, they expect AI revenues to double next year. Additionally, most analysts are extremely bullish, with 28 buy ratings and a median price target of $90, representing over 20% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a 10% pullback, it is time to buy Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The memory maker is among the best-positioned AI wealth-building stocks due to its high bandwidth memory (HBM). Importantly, HBM memory reduces bottlenecks, increasing training efficiency for large language models.\n\nAlthough Micron Technology tumbled after Q3 of FY 2024 earnings, the results were stellar. The company blew past estimates, reporting revenues of $6.81 billion for the third quarter against estimates of $6.67 billion. Data center drove the strength as AI demand led to 50% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) growth in the segment. Furthermore, the company grew its share in high-margin AI products such as data center solid-state drives and HBM.\n\nAnother impressive highlight was the company disclosing that HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and 2025. Due to robust demand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sanjay Mehrotra noted in Q3 prepared remarks that Micron Technology was on track for record FY 2024 revenues. Besides, he expects this momentum to carry over into FY 2025.\n\nIndeed, MU is set for a banner FY 2025 due to AI demand, making it one of the top AI wealth-building stocks. Moreover, an ongoing shift from commoditized memory to high-margin AI products will boost profitability.\n\nASML Holding N.Y. (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs demand for AI accelerates, semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers are scrambling to increase capacity. This ramp-up spells opportunity for ASML Holding N.Y. (NASDAQ:ASML), the maker of EUV machines used to manufacture chips.\n\nSeveral reasons prevail for maintaining a bullish stance on ASML. First, AI-related revenue is soaring due to memory demand driven by advanced memories such as HBM and DDR5. As a result, the semiconductor equipment maker is seeing increasing orders from memory makers like Micron Technology.\n\nSecondly, the firm benefits from increased subsidies and grants to the semiconductor sector. Due to incentives and grants from laws such as the CHIPS and Science Act, chip manufacturers are opening new facilities. For instance, Micron Technology is constructing new fabs in New York and Idaho. In line with this expansion, it will spend $8 billion of capex in 2024 and increase it to a mid-30s percentage of revenue in 2025.\n\nThe outlook for ASML is very positive. Almost every foundry and integrated device maker is constructing new chip manufacturing facilities. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have broken ground on new projects in the U.S. and Europe. These facilities will be filled with ASML equipment, making the stock a top buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Recession-Proof Utility Stocks to Power Up Your Portfolio This July",
        "content": "Recession-proof utility stocks have always been stable dividend payers, making them popular long-term investments. But new exponential demand driven by artificial intelligence transforms these Wall Street wallflowers into high-growth AI plays. According to Goldman Sachs Research analysts, AI is set to drive a 160% increase in data center power demand. With interest rates potentially lowering this year, now is an opportune time to power up portfolios with utilities.\n\nThese stocks carry interest rate risk that can draw conservative investors away when rates rise. However, with Treasury yields declining and grid infrastructure requiring upgrades to meet swelling power demand, utilities may soon shine brighter. As Exelon\u2019s CEO predicts, electricity consumption from Chicago\u2019s data centers alone could jump 900%, rivaling multiple nuclear plants. Beyond dividends, growth potential is why Goldman Sachs touts utilities as an alternative way to tap the AI boom. Some companies are bracing for up to 80% sales jumps from data centers. Yet valuations don\u2019t account for this pending surge.\n\nThat disconnect signals an underpriced upside, perfect for investors wanting AI exposure without overpaying for tech stocks basking in the hype. As AI transforms utilities from merely recession-proof to growth-charged, their stocks could electrify portfolios with power to spare this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the U.S.\u2019s largest electric utilities and renewable energy companies, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has established itself as one of the top recession-proof utility stocks. Its subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is America\u2019s largest electric utility, serving over 12 million people. It also projects continued strong growth, with over 100,000 new customers added in the first quarter of 2024 alone.\n\nDespite economic downturns, people still need electricity, which provides NextEra Energy with steady revenue. For 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share between $3.23 to $3.43. It also plans to grow its dividends per share by 10% through 2026. NextEra Energy Resources, its renewable energy subsidiary, also had a record quarter. Thus, it added 2,765 megawatts of solar and storage projects to its portfolio.\n\nWith renewable energy demand rapidly rising to power data centers and AI technology, NextEra Energy is positioned to capitalize through its $85-95 billion infrastructure investments planned through 2025. Over the next decade, FPL expects a huge boost in renewable energy production. Therefore, it\u2019s projected to increase from 6% to 38% of total solar generation and a doubling of battery storage. So, while recessions may negatively impact other stocks, NextEra Energy\u2019s essential electric services, strong earnings, dividend growth, and pivotal role in the renewable energy transition make it a stable, recession-proof utility stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthern Company (SO) the southern company logo displayed several times on a screen\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthern Company (NYSE:SO), the Atlanta-based energy giant, has established itself as one of the more stable recession-proof utility stocks. Its operations across electricity and natural gas position it well to provide consistent shareholder returns regardless of economic conditions.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Southern Company reported strong financials. This included $6.6 billion in operating revenues and $1.3 billion in earnings before income taxes. It also achieved $1.1 billion in net income available to shareholders. These represent respectable year-over-year growth rates of 2.6%, 44.4%, and 31.0%, respectively. Southern\u2019s earnings per share also grew from $0.79 in Q1 2023 to $1.03 in Q1 2024.\n\nSouthern\u2019s regulated electric and gas utilities are a fundamental factor that makes it recession-proof. The latter generate steady revenues across business cycles. For example, in Q1 2024, the company saw 1.7% weather-adjusted retail sales growth. Additionally, it added over 75,000 new utility customers. Southern also has major infrastructure projects, like the recently completed Plant Vogtle nuclear facility in Georgia, which will supply carbon-free energy to over 1 million homes and businesses for decades.\n\nWith strong operational performance, consistent customer growth, and long-term clean energy investments, Southern has shown resilience regardless of the economy. For these reasons, Southern remains a stable choice among recession-proof utility stocks.\n\nWEC Energy Group (WEC) WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC), headquartered in Wisconsin, is one of the Midwest\u2019s biggest electric and natural gas utility holding firms. With a focus on reliable service and consistent dividend growth, WEC qualifies as one of the top recession-proof utility stocks.\n\nA critical factor that makes WEC Energy recession-proof is its impressive record of dividend growth. The company has increased its dividend for 21 consecutive years, with a 7% dividend raise announced in January 2024 to $3.34 per share. This stability results from consistent earnings growth, with 2023 adjusted earnings per share rising 4% to $4.63. Even in times of economic uncertainty, households and businesses still need electricity and heating, allowing WEC\u2019s profits to remain steady.\n\nIn addition, WEC Energy intends to pay out 65-70% of its earnings as dividends. With a forward dividend yield of 3.7% based on the newly announced dividend rate, the stock offers an attractive income stream for investors. This aligns with the company\u2019s focus on shareholder returns.\n\nWe Energies, a subsidiary of WEC Energy, has also just obtained approval for a $300 million distribution project in Mount Pleasant, where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is building its new data center campus and investing $3.3 billion to spur AI innovation. Therefore, for investors seeking a defensive stock that can weather market volatility but with AI exposure, WEC Energy stands out in the utility sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?",
        "content": "Amid the stock split talk, investors need to keep Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in mind. The current price of around $460 per share is well below the nominal prices at which stocks like Broadcom or Nvidia recently announced splits.\n\nAdmittedly, it might be presumptuous to say that Microsoft is the next stock split. Many stocks are soaring to very high triple-digit prices amid an improving economy and game-changing market shifts in the tech sector. However, Microsoft differs from these names in one key area, which could prompt a split sooner rather than later.\n\nWhy Microsoft may split soon\n\nPut simply, Microsoft may split soon because it is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unlike the other major indexes, the Dow is a price-weighted index. This means stocks with high nominal prices have disproportionate sway over the index score.\n\nAdmittedly, the index's price-weighting approach remains controversial. So far, Berkshire Hathaway has allowed its shares to maintain a very high price rather than seek inclusion in the Dow. Nonetheless, other companies like Microsoft value being a Dow component and will probably bow to pressure to split its stock to maintain that status.\n\nThat pressure could come soon as it is among the highest-priced stocks in the Dow 30. It closely approximates Goldman Sachs's current price and is close in price to UnitedHealth Group, which sells at around $505 per share right now.\n\nAdditionally, investors may recall that Dow component Apple initiated a 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020 when its pre-split price was close to $500 per share. Thus, it should not surprise anyone if Microsoft were to announce a stock split in short order.\n\nThe growth of Microsoft\n\nInvestors should also remember that Microsoft is, ultimately, a stock split candidate because of its underlying business growth. The company's paradigm shifted after Satya Nadella became CEO in February 2014.\n\nNadella's most notable accomplishment was making Microsoft more of a cloud-oriented business, shifting its software products to the cloud and making them mobile-friendly. Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft's Azure became the second-most popular cloud infrastructure platform, lagging behind only Amazon's Amazon Web Services, which pioneered the industry. Image source: Statista.\n\nAlso, Nadella made Microsoft more artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented. The company partnered with OpenAI to link its search engine to ChatGPT. Through this, it launched Copilot, a chatbot powered by generative AI. This partnership also linked ChatGPT with its Bing search engine, making Microsoft a credible competitive threat to Alphabet's search business.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Microsoft's market cap has grown to over $3.4 trillion, making it one of the world's largest publicly traded companies.\u00a0Given that the cloud and AI will probably continue growing for years to come, the company's growth would eventually make a split necessary, even without the association with the Dow.\n\nThe coming Microsoft stock split\n\nUltimately, when Microsoft will next split its stock is unclear, but a split is likely coming soon.\n\nAdmittedly, its position as one of the Dow 30 stocks is likely to hasten a split. Allowing Microsoft's stock price to climb much further without a softening stock split could give the software giant an uncomfortably strong influence over the popular market index. However, investors should probably credit the company's tech-driven growth for making the split necessary in the first place.\n\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft is back on the cutting edge of tech and has positioned itself as a major force in the cloud and AI industries.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its \u201cClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. U.S. stocks increased during a difficult quarter for diversified portfolios due to the market leadership remaining centered around a few mega-cap firms that were thought to be the major winners in the expanding AI industry. The benchmark Russell 3000 Index returned 3.22% in the quarter. The strategy underperformed the benchmark in the second quarter and had gains in four of 10 sectors in which it was invested, on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection detracted the most, mainly stock selection in the IT, consumer discretionary, health care, industrials, and real estate sectors. Please check the top 5 holdings of the strategy, to know its best pick in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter.

        "title": "3 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The stock market broadly has had an excellent year so far -- the S&P 500 is up 17%. Naturally, some hot stocks have outpaced that growth, and while it might seem counter-intuitive, some of the stocks with big gains already behind them could still be among the best places for investors to deploy their investing dollars now.\n\nHere are three growth stocks that have outpaced the market year to date, but that also have strong competitive positions that make them worth buying today and holding well into the future.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSince artificial intelligence (AI) has become the hottest topic on Wall Street, much of the attention has been on high-end semiconductor companies like Nvidia, which have been putting up eye-popping results quarter after quarter. However, investors shouldn't forget that Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI boom due in large part to its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft has already added AI features to several of its products, and because of the reach of its product suite, many consumers have already started to see them in action. For example, the Copilot tool that it has added to productivity applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint can help users draft documents and analyze data more easily.\n\nAI is impacting Microsoft's business in other ways as well. In its most recently reported fiscal quarter, revenue from its Azure cloud unit increased by 31% year over year, with 7 percentage points of growth coming from AI alone. Overall revenue grew by 17% to $62 billion, while earnings per share increased by 20%.\n\nMicrosoft is a leader in the software and cloud infrastructure space, and its AI investments are likely to strengthen its position for years to come.\n\nApple\n\nAt first, it seemed like Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was behind when it came to AI. While other tech companies were garnering headlines for their AI-related activities, there wasn't much news coming from the iPhone maker. That all changed last month when it held its annual developer conference, where it unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will roll out later this year.\n\nWhat's most important about Apple's foray into AI is how it will reinforce its ecosystem. Its new AI features are only going to be available on newer devices, which should drive some degree of an upgrade cycle. Additionally, while these features will be free when they debut, one could imagine a scenario where some aspects of its AI offering become part of a subscription service. This would give a boost to Apple's fast-growing services segment, which is currently its second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is already one of the largest companies in the world and boasts one of the most recognizable brands. If its efforts in AI can continue to drive consumers to buy more of its devices and subscribe to more of its services, the stock could continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nWith so much attention being focused on the few companies making the types of cutting-edge semiconductor chips that can power AI, it's easy to overlook a company like Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN), which manufactures a wide range of less powerful chips that are needed for everyday uses and products. From your microwave oven to the entertainment center in your car, chips are nearly everywhere, and Texas Instruments makes a lot of them.\n\nYear to date, Texas Instruments' stock is up 18%. However, that run has only brought the stock back to its late 2021 level, reflecting the struggles the company has experienced over the past few years.\n\nIt's important to remember that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and outside of the high-powered AI chip niche, the industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the past year or so. Texas Instruments' revenue and net income have declined, which is typical during these kinds of downturns.\n\nThe bottom line is that Texas Instrument plays a vital role in the semiconductor space, and down cycles like the current one are normal. The fact that the stock price is up year to date despite the company's declines on the top and bottom lines demonstrates Wall Street's belief that these market conditions will be a short-term challenge for it. Over the long term, Texas Instruments remains a solid business worth buying now and holding for the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "SoundHound AI Stock May Be Poised for a Correction. Be Careful.",
        "content": "There\u2019s a great deal to like about Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock at this point. Its exposure to the AI megatrend, alliance with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and strong, overall growth are all in its favor.\n\nHowever, given the stock\u2019s recent, overdone rally, along with the name\u2019s extremely high valuation and significant competition, I recommend that investors hold the shares but avoid buying them.\n\nSoundhound AI Stock\u2019s Many Positive Attributes\n\nSoundhound, which produces an AI-powered voice assistant used by businesses, is benefiting from being part of the AI megatrend that is being embraced by investors and many companies. Partly as a result of this situation, Soundhound AI stock soared 157% between the beginning of the year and the afternoon of July 11.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fact many companies seek to save money by implementing AI-powered tools likely helped Soundhound successfully convince many to adopt its offerings. That is a huge factor behind Soundhound\u2019s impressive growth. Last quarter, the firm\u2019s top line surged 73% versus the same period a year earlier to $11.6 million while its cumulative subscriptions & bookings backlog soared about 80% year-over-year to a very impressive $682 million.\n\nFinally, Soundhound\u2019s alliance with Nvidia boosted SoundhoundAI stock while also lifting financial results. In February, the chip giant disclosed that it purchased almost $3.7 million of Soundhound AI stock. The information undoubtedly lit a fire under Soundhound\u2019s shares, as its stock surged from $2.26 on Feb. 14, the day before the news was disclosed, to $8.24 on March 18. Although the shares subsequently sharply retreated, Nvidia\u2019s investment in Soundhound has put the latter company on many investors\u2019 radar and made them excited about its outlook.\n\nAlso importantly, the company\u2019s association with Nvidia has undoubtedly helped it obtain more customers since firms are likely impressed by the investment.\n\nAfterall, Soundhound\u2019s list of customers is impressive. Among them are Applebee\u2019s, Church\u2019s Chicken, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA),Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMLY).\n\nA Potentially Overdone Rally\n\nOn July 10, SoundHound announced Stellantis began including \u201cits\u00a0SoundHound Chat AI\u00a0voice assistant with integrated ChatGPT\u201d in its \u201cPeugeot, Opel and Vauxhall vehicle brands across 11 European markets.\u201d The news sparked a huge rally in SoundHound AI stock.\n\nNot surprisingly, SoundHound did not reveal the financial terms of the deal. But as a longtime investor in BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), I know the royalties software makers obtain from auto companies can be quite low. For example, BlackBerry historically only received $1.50 to $5 per vehicle for its infotainment offering. It also received as little as $5 per vehicle for its more advanced technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s more, SoundHound began providing voice AI systems for Stellantis last year. That means this new deal may not produce large revenue increases for the tech firm.\n\nValuation and Competition\n\nBy any measure, the valuation of Soundhound AI stock is quite elevated. The shares have a forward price-to-sales ratio of over 17 times. Its enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is a gigantic 30.5 times.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the company reportedly has many competitors. Amomg them are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\u00a0Further, a company called Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) is said to have taken automotive customers away from Soundhound in the past.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SoundHound AI Stock\n\nI believe that SoundhoundAI has a bright future. However, given the company\u2019s high valuation, its many tough competitors and the market\u2019s exuberance about its deal with Stellantis, I expect the shares to drop significantly below their current levels in the medium term.\n\nSuch a downturn could occur because Soundhound reports weaker-than-expected quarterly results or because it loses a key customer. Alternatively, a correction by the stock market could cause the company\u2019s share price to drop sharply.\n\nConsequently, I recommend investors wait for a meaningful pullback before pulling the trigger rather than chasing it in the wake of its recent rally. However, investors who already own the shares should hold onto them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in BB.

        "title": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Knows How To Allocate Capital Effectively",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$107b \u00f7 (US$484b - US$119b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 7.5%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Microsoft compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Microsoft's ROCE Trend?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 75%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microsoft thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 249% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nLike most companies, Microsoft does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nMicrosoft is not the only stock earning high returns.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) facilitates online transactions globally. The company\u2019s total payment volume (TPV) for Q1 2024 was $403.9 billion. A considerable increase reflects the platform\u2019s extensive usage and trust among users. This 14% increase in TPV points to PayPal\u2019s moat in the digital payment sector and its ability to handle vast transaction volumes sharply. The transaction margin dollars, which grew by\u00a04% to $3.5 billion,\u00a0are another essential metric. Although slightly below the top-line growth rate, this growth indicates an improvement in operational edge and profitability per transaction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, PayPal\u2019s EPS increased by 27% annually, reaching $1.08, reflecting the company\u2019s ability to boost market value through sharp cost management and strategic reinvestments. Meanwhile, operating income increased by\u00a015% to $1.4 billion, demonstrating effective cost management and operational edge. The operating margin grew by 0.84% to 18.2%. Hence, these improvements reflect the company\u2019s ability to generate higher profits from its revenue.\n\nIn short, PayPal is on the stocks to buy list based on growth in total payment volume, sharp transaction margins, and an uplift in the bottom line.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) leads in CPUs and other computing technologies. The company can secure considerable deals, highlighted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the fifth Intel 18A customer and updating the lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion. Indeed, the roadmap extension with Intel 14A marks Intel\u2019s tech advancements.\u00a0This\u00a0is the first process node in the industry to use High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet (High NA EUV) technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the\u00a0grants and tax incentives from the CHIPS Act derive massive financial support.\u00a0This\u00a0enables large-scale investments (CapEx) in research and manufacturing capabilities.\u00a0Intel\u2019s aim of hitting five nodes in four years, while ambitious, is on track. This rapid node transition is crucial for maintaining technological leadership and competitiveness in the semiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, the production ramp of products like Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake may initiate in H1 2025. This positions Intel to capitalize on these new technologies, like AI. The sequence of product launches with advanced node availability ensures that Intel remains at the forefront of high-growth tech markets.\n\nIn summary, Intel\u2019s presence on the stocks to buy list is led by its technological advancements and large contract deals.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) produces and distributes films, TV series, and digital content. The company\u2019s content pipeline is robust. Numerous high-impact projects are scheduled over 2024-2025. This includes new seasons of massively followed series like House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, and The Last of Us. There are also major film releases like Joker 2. The release of new Lord of the Rings movies starting in 2026 is vital, given the franchise\u2019s appeal and historical leads.\n\nAdditionally, the company is also investing in new\u00a0technologies like AI. AI is used to personalize content discovery, optimize ad placements, and streamline various processes.\u00a0This tech integration may derive sharp consumer experiences and increase the efficacy of marketing and ad sales. The company has considerable leads in deleveraging, repaying $1.1 billion of debt in Q1 and more than $6 billion over the past 12 months.\u00a0This\u00a0has reduced interest expenses and improved the company\u2019s financial flexibility.\n\nTo conclude, Warner Bros. is a high mark on the stocks to buy list based on its robust content pipeline and investments in AI-driven technologies.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL, INTC and WBD.

        "title": "US senators call out Big Tech's new approach to poaching talent, products from smaller AI startups",
        "content": "In the race to stay ahead in artificial intelligence, the biggest technology companies are swallowing up the talent and products of innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.\n\nSan Francisco-based Adept announced a deal late last month that will send its CEO and key employees to Amazon and give the e-commerce giant a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.\n\nSome call it a \u201creverse acqui-hire.\u201d Others call it poaching. Whatever it's called, it's alarming to some in Washington who see it as an attempt to bypass U.S. laws that protect against monopolies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the massive consolidation that\u2019s going on in AI,\u201d U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe technical lingo is \u2018up and down the stack\u2019. But, in plain English, a few companies control a major portion of the market, and just concentrate \u2014 rather than on innovation \u2014 trying to buy out everybody else\u2019s talent.\u201d\n\nSo-called \u201cacqui-hires,\u201d in which one company acquires another to absorb talent, have been common in the tech industry for decades, said Michael A. Cusumano, a business professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But what\u2019s happening in the AI industry is a little different.\n\n\u201cTo acquire only some employees or the majority, but not all, license technology, leave the company functioning but not really competing, that\u2019s a new twist,\u201d Cusumano said.\n\nA similar maneuver happened at the AI company Inflection in March when Microsoft hired its co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman to head up Microsoft's consumer AI business, along with Inflection's chief scientist and several of its top engineers and researchers. That arrangement has already attracted some scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Europe.\n\nWyden also wants U.S. regulators to investigate the Amazon-Adept deal. He sent a letter Friday urging antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission that \u201csustained, pointed action is necessary to fight undue consolidation across the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here is instead of buying startups outright, big tech companies are trying a new play,\" Wyden said in an interview before sending the letter. \u201dThey don\u2019t want to formally acquire the companies, avoiding the antitrust scrutiny. I think that\u2019s going to be the playbook until the FTC really starts digging into these deals.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and lawmakers from both parties have championed stronger oversight of the tech industry in recent years, likely scaring off big acquisitions that might have sailed through in earlier eras. U.S. antitrust enforcers, for example, plan on investigating the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom, with the Department of Justice looking into chipmaker Nvidia and the Federal Trade Commission scrutinizing business partners Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Google, are trying to be conservative and not make too many acquisitions in the AI space, Cusumano said.\n\n\u201cIt seems clever. I would think, though, that they\u2019re not fooling anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nFor smaller AI startups, the problem is also that building AI systems is expensive, requiring costly computer chips, power-hungry data centers, huge troves of data to train upon and highly skilled computer scientists.\n\nAdept, which aims to make AI software agents that help people with workplace tasks, said it was trying to do two things at once \u2014 build the foundational AI technology as well as the products for end users. But continuing on that path \u201cwould\u2019ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision,\u201d it said in a statement explaining the Amazon deal.\n\n\u201cThey may have made a decision that they have no real future and just don\u2019t have deep enough pockets to compete in this space, so they probably prefer to be acquired outright,\" Cusumano said. \"But if Amazon is not willing or not able to do that, then this is kind of a second-best approach for them.\u201d\n\nWyden has long taken an interest in technology, helping to write the 1996 law that helped set the ground rules for free speech on the internet. He said he generally favors a straightforward approach that encourages innovation, with guardrails as needed.\n\nBut in the AI industry, he said, \u201ccompanies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, either own major parts of the AI ecosystem or they have a leg up thanks to their massive resources.\u201d\n\nJohn F. Coyle, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, said he believes that Amazon hiring Adept employees without buying the company is clearly a move to avoid antitrust problems. But that type of hiring isn\u2019t a \u201creverse acqui-hire,\u201d he said.\n\nAcqui-hires are typically face-saving moves that can be spun into success stories, Coyle said, and provide an alternative to liquidating a business. A smaller company can say it was sold to Amazon or Facebook and spin it as a positive, for example, even if wasn\u2019t the founders\u2019 original plan.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an acqui-hire. This is a straight up poach,\u201d Coyle said of Amazon and Adept.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just happen in the tech world, he said, calling the move \u201ca version of a very old story.\u201d In his class, Coyle said, he teaches students about a case from the 1950s involving an advertising agency in New York City. Some employees left to start a new business and poached roughly 100 others to come to work for them.\n\n\u201cThere are innumerable instances where one company went and raided another to take all their employees,\" Coyle said. \"That existed before the acqui-hire, that is going to happen after the acqui-hire.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Nvidia Is Slowly Becoming The IBM Of The AI Era' Says Former AMD And Tesla Engineer. Here's The Problem With That Comparison\n\nJim Keller, a well-known engineer who\u2019s worked at AMD and Tesla and now leads the AI company Tenstorrent, recently said something interesting on the DemystifySci podcast. He thinks Nvidia is becoming like IBM back in the day but in the AI world. While this shows how powerful Nvidia is right now in AI hardware, it also raises some concerns.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with low minimum investment.\n\nNvidia\u2019s smart move to focus on AI early has paid off big time \u2014 its earnings were over $26 billion in the first quarter of 2024. It\u2019s also one of the top three companies in the world by market valuation, breathing down the necks of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe company is now a major player in the AI hardware market, with its powerful GPUs used by tech giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. It seems that everyone is on the Nvidia hype train, as CEO Jensen Huang calls AI the \"next industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia at the center.\n\nKeller, an extremely accomplished engineer and entrepreneur, knows what he\u2019s talking about. However, he might not realize just how unfortunate his comment that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era\" is.\n\nIn the early 1980s, IBM was huge in the personal computer market. Their PCs were everywhere, and saying \"PC\" often meant you were talking about an IBM machine. But, IBM\u2019s reign didn\u2019t last long because of a few key mistakes and growing competition.\n\nTrending: Sun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!\n\nIBM\u2019s strategy of using an open architecture helped it dominate the market initially, but it also made it easy for other companies to make IBM-compatible PCs. These competitors sold similar products at lower prices, which ate into IBM's market share.\n\nThe partnership between IBM and Microsoft also backfired as Bill Gates\u2019 company retained the rights to sell its operating system (MS-DOS) to other companies, paving the way for the rise of Microsoft Windows.\n\nAs PC Gamer reports, as Windows became the dominant operating system, PCs became more associated with Microsoft than IBM. IBM\u2019s slow adaptation to market changes and sticking to old business models allowed competitors to gain a foothold. By the 1990s, IBM's PC business was struggling, and in 2005, IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo, leaving the personal computer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Many are surprised that they are eligible for a tax reduction on their home, with just a few seconds you can see if you can save in 3 minutes or less.\n\nNvidia could run into similar problems. As more companies start making AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs might get cheaper because of the competition. Technology moves fast, so today\u2019s best chips can become outdated quickly. As Nvidia keeps growing, it could face more competition and rules to follow, just like IBM did.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the $600 billion AI question. As Analyst David Chan from Sequoia writes, there\u2019s a big gap between the money being spent on AI infrastructure and the revenue AI is actually bringing in.\n\nAI companies need to make about $600 billion a year to earn enough to cover these huge investments.\n\nChan said the gap was \"only\" $200 billion in September 2023. Even though Nvidia is making a lot of money, the rest of the AI market isn\u2019t growing fast enough.\n\nKeller\u2019s comparison to IBM is both a compliment and a warning because Nvidia's success now doesn\u2019t guarantee its future. After all, the tech world is full of once market-leading companies that didn\u2019t keep up with changes.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "While the term artificial intelligence (AI) has become something of a buzzword recently, the more accurate term for what most AI companies are aiming to achieve is machine learning. However, due to the cultural popularity of AI thanks to science fiction and Hollywood, the term has eclipsed machine learning as the primary descriptor for the current trend of data analytics and targeted information searches that constitute much of the AI sector. As such, many of the major AI stocks might be better classified as machine learning stocks.\n\nYet, the real value these machine learning stocks hold is in their potential future applications for data analytics, as machine learning models are intended to automate various algorithmic processes. Depending on the potential profit generation from this automation, a machine learning company could see revenues increase as a result of its software service. Investors would be wise to pay attention to these three machine learning stocks.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA long-time industry staple, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is one of the earliest developers of machine learning technology still on the market. Furthermore, one of its newest iterations of the Watson AI models, Watson Studio has the potential to make the company a critical member of the future of AI training and machine learning.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this new platform, IBM aims to empower smaller-scale developers to design and implement their own AIs through machine learning training. This enables data scientists and software engineers to tailor the Watson AI base to their specific needs while providing data and insights to IBM\u2019s development team.\n\nEssentially, this means that IBM enters into a symbiotic relationship with developers where the two work together to improve the efficiency of their respective machine-learning structures. With the introduction of Watson Studio and a robust profit margin so far in 2024, IBM stock continues to look like a great value among machine learning stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a dominant force in the software and cloud computing markets through its Microsoft Azure business section. Now the company is also pioneering the concept of machine learning models as a service to derive even more revenue from its powerful data center business.\n\nThe intended value of the Azure Machine Learning platform stems from Microsoft\u2019s ability to create scalable data analysis and AI training environments for customers of any size and application. Additionally, with the world\u2019s largest software user base, Microsoft\u2019s vast data resources offer a significant edge in AI development, enabling its machine learning services to become that much more effective.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis positions Microsoft to carve out a niche among machine learning stocks by improving the enterprise-level functionality of its customers while using that data to improve its own products. Pair this with Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the tech sector and deep pockets for further research and it\u2019s likely MSFT will continue to be a big player in the world of AI and machine learning development.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo discussion of machine learning stocks is complete without considering what Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has to offer. Alphabet has been a consistently quiet member of the machine learning community through its development and maintenance of a software called TensorFlow.\n\nOver eight years since its release and with dual functionality for programming in both Python and C++, TensorFlow is now one of the central tools through which many developers build machine learning applications. Though Alphabet does not earn revenue from its use as it is open source and free, the company owns the architecture on which many machine learning applications are built on.\n\nThis improves Alphabet\u2019s ability to later acquire these developers or cooperate with them on future development cycles. Taking this into consideration alongside a projected $340.61 billion in revenue for 2024, Alphabet stands out as a strong contender among machine learning stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget A.I.

        "content": "More companies and individuals are storing valuable data in the internet. While the internet has allowed people and organizations to become more efficient and access more choices, it also presents risks. Hackers can infiltrate databases and get access to sensitive data.\u00a0This increase in risks present online has provided some tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks and the companies they represent.\n\nCybersecurity firms minimize the risk and allow people to use the internet in a safe and secure manner. These companies shield businesses from cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals use software to detect and address issues before they get serious.\n\nInvestors can profit by finding industries with high demand and plenty of growth prospects. As data continues to proliferate the web, cybersecurity companies should continue to experience impressive growth rates. The cybersecurity market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% from now until 2030. Several corporations have positioned themselves to benefit from tailwinds. These are some of the top cybersecurity stocks that long-term investors may want to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 58% year-to-date (YTD) and have soared by 480% over the past five years. The cybersecurity giant is a recent addition to the S&P 500 and continues to deliver impressive revenue growth.\n\nCrowdstrike reported 33% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q1 2025 and now has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. Net income came to $42.8 million compared to $500,000 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company is incorporating artificial intelligence to keep people safe. Charlotte AI makes it easier for cybersecurity professionals and teams to detect issues in real-time and perform mundane tasks in a shorter amount of time. Crowdstrike has a lofty valuation, but profit margin expansion can lead to promising long-term gains.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the company. Crowdstrike is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 31 analysts. The highest price target of $440 per share suggests a 13% upside.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) A man sitting in front of a computer\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a data security firm that helps clients stay on top of their data from one central cloud-based platform. The company has an annual recurring revenue model that recently topped $770 million. That\u2019s up by 16% YOY.\n\nUnlike most cybersecurity stocks, CommVault is a smaller company with a reasonable valuation. It only has a $5.5 billion market cap and a 33 P/E ratio. However, the stock has done its part in beating the market. Shares are up by 61% YTD and have gained 143% over the past five years. Investors who like Crowdstrike as a company, but believe the valuation is overstretched, may want to give CommVault Systems a closer look.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street hasn\u2019t been covering this stock as much, but a recent price target of $140 per share suggests a 13% upside from current levels. CommVault System\u2019s revenue and earnings have been accelerating in recent years. Revenue increased by 10% YOY in Q4 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) operates in numerous verticals, including cybersecurity.

The platform is a part of Microsoft Cloud revenue which hit $35.1 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue increased by 23% YOY while overall revenue was up by 17%.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its cybersecurity market share with Copilot for Security. This AI tool makes it easier for small businesses to monitor their digital defenses and take decisive action against threats. Microsoft has many bulls in Wall Street and is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests a 7% upside.\n\nMicrosoft is the only stock on this list that isn\u2019t a pure cybersecurity play. Investors also get exposure to LinkedIn, Xbox, Bing, Microsoft\u2019s suite of business software and other segments. The well-diversified stock is up by 26% YTD and has gained 241% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, CVLT, and MSFT.

        "content": "As the adoption of metaverse technologies may take take years, investors in undervalued metaverse stocks can bet on long-term growth. An unlimited digital world that can accommodate millions of people is a goldmine, as it represents a new market with solvent modern participants. Since the metaverse industry is only in the early stages of its development, buying shares in related companies promises early investment benefits. The field requires many components for its sustainable operation, which expands the list of areas that will gain from the introduction of metaverses.\n\nVirtual reality technologies will play a crucial role in this process, as users need VR headsets and haptic devices. However, infrastructure development also involves computing power providers, chip manufacturers, Internet providers, software and cybersecurity specialists. By 2030, the industry is projected to grow by more than 30% per year. If you are among the first metaverse investors, you can get a piece of the pie from the business, which could be worth more than $2369.70 billion in 2033.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) Fidelity Investments sign hangs from a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLaunched on April 19, 2022, the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ: FMET) is one of the youngest exchange-traded funds in the United States. Its main goal is to track the performance of the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which includes many companies in the metaverse sector. The connection can be diverse: from the production and sale of chips for this area to the full-scale development of the meta-space. The fund offers diversification so that enthusiasts are more likely to benefit from the growth of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn October-November 2022, the asset price did not exceed $20, while now buyers are willing to pay more than $30. The growth is smooth, without sharp jumps and significant plateau zones, anttracting investors with its stability. Over the past 3 months, FMET has added 11.25% to its value and has risen to the current level of $31.94. The inclusion of top-ranked tech stocks in the index, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), has contributed to the current growth, which may continue in the coming months. Experts predict that the stock will reach the $40 mark and have high expectations for the fund\u2019s future.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is a giant of the tech industry, and therefore has enough resources to reconfigure its activities to meet the trends. One of the latest such changes is the reformatting of the 2022-2024 period. The decline in the share price below $100 was the result of concerns about aggressive investment in metaverse initiatives. However, after breaking out of the low point in October 2022, the company began a steady growth that continues to this day. The implementation of AI technology and related advances have propelled Meta to unprecedented heights. With a price per share of $534.69, the company exceeds its 2022 figures by five times, but the potential is still not fully unlocked so META is still among the undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence is paying off in the form of more accurate targeted advertising and, consequently, higher ad prices. The latest earnings report exceeded market expectations and confirmed the correctness of the diversification approach. The bullish sentiment around META continues to grow, as does the wave of excitement over the positive impact of AI, which means we can expect new rounds of the company\u2019s development shortly.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArchitecture, engineering, entertainment, and construction are all areas that require a reliable software provider, and Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) meets this demand. The company with a market capitalization of $53.08 billion has gained a foothold in the market and become an integral part of many high-tech metaverse projects. After the downturn of April-May 2024, Autodesk began to gain momentum, as reflected in its indicators such as the 50-day moving average (+29.12) and the 200-day moving average (+42.99). The latter indicator shows an increase of 21.07%, which characterizes the bullish momentum of the stock.

        "content": "What do you consider your buy-and-hold stocks? Some investors focus on growth, others lean towards value, and some even bet heavily on trending meme stocks \u2014 but which strategy is optimal?\n\nAs with everything in investing, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all rule for selecting your buy-and-hold stocks. However, for most retail investors with a long-term horizon, certain characteristics should form the backbone of your search. You\u2019ll notice recurring themes if you research these companies deeply enough. Broadly speaking, these potential buy-and-hold stocks combine a proven operational track record with substantial growth, robust financial health, and clear upside potential, making long-term capital appreciation a clear likelihood.\n\nAt the same time, some of these remain speculative plays compared to pure-value investments; this increases the chance of rapid growth and gains while their inherent risk is buffered by the stability of other buy-and-hold stocks, ultimately creating a well-rounded portfolio for the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSay what you will about Elon Musk, but there\u2019s no denying that investors who counted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) among their portfolio\u2019s buy-and-hold stocks had a stellar performance over the years. Just ask the legions of short sellers who bet otherwise and lost billions. Tesla\u2019s next bull run may just be getting started following Musk\u2019s pay package approval, which cements his focus on the firm and is already bearing fruit.\n\nThis shift is already evident just weeks after the decision, with Musk redirecting his AI focus back to Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is constructing a massive GPU warehouse to house over 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, aiming to centralize AI development under Tesla. This follows Tesla\u2019s announcement of a $3 billion to $4 billion investment in AI hardware, signaling Musk and Tesla\u2019s commitment to becoming leaders in AI. Enhanced AI capabilities will significantly contribute to advancing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d addressing the final major obstacle to achieving full self-driving car technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi event on August 8 may prove the final catalyst catapulting Tesla from the (comparatively) lower price range it\u2019s traded at for the past year \u2014 meaning investors looking to buy and hold stocks like Tesla should act soon.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) may not have the flashiest operational model, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its buy-and-hold stock status \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. Visa\u2019s reliable sales streams, operational model, and willingness to adapt to new trends and markets are just some of the reasons Visa stock returned more than 400% over the past decade, doubling the S&P 500\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa owns about 20% of the global cashless payment processing market today, but that doesn\u2019t mean management is content with its current dominance. The opposite is true as Visa is making massive inroads toward new client lists while adopting new technology.\n\nSpecifically, Visa is bringing digital wallets (already popular among consumers) to enterprise and corporate clients to help streamline their spending. Corporate credit is already the largest chunk of global credit utilization, and digital wallet opportunities promise to increase its size further and reward VIsa\u2019s efforts.\n\nMarkel Group (MKL) Markel website homepage MRK stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarkel Group (NYSE:MKL), primarily known as an insurance company, might initially seem like an unconventional pick among buy-and-hold stocks given the sector\u2019s typically tight margins, despite benefiting short-term benefits from bond yields due to their substantial cash reserves. However, there is much more to Markel Group than meets the eye.\n\nOften dubbed the \u201cbaby Berkshire Hathaway\u201d (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), Markel Group, under the leadership of CEO Thomas Gayner, is somewhat modeled after Warren Buffett\u2019s approach at Berkshire. Gayner runs Markel as an insurance company and a large holding company that uses \u201cunderwriting profits to invest in equity, through both publicly traded stocks and ownership stakes in private companies.\u201d\n\nThis strategy paid off handsomely, with Markel achieving a 360% return over the past 20 years, edging out the S&P 500\u2019s 326% gain during the same period.\n\nDespite its seemingly high share price, much of the bearish sentiment around Markel focuses on its core insurance underwriting business, overlooking Gayner\u2019s innovative and successful investment approach. If you consider Gayner\u2019s historical performance and believe in his strategy\u2019s sustainability, Markel could be the biggest opportunity in decades if it goes the way of Berkshire.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of buy-and-hold stocks operating within payment processing, few fintech stocks can beat Block (NYSE:SQ). After a few rough quarters, compounded by wider market unease and a crippling short report that ultimately proved overblown, Block\u2019s most recent earnings report points to renewed strength.\n\nSpecifically, Block\u2019s gross profit improved by more than 20% to hit $2.09 billion, with much of that coming from its Cash App segment, which saw profit climb 25% year-over-year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 20% or better profitability growth, while sales also jumped 20%.\n\nMoreover, like Visa, Block is focusing on the future of finance \u2014 with a big emphasis on its crypto exchange and new blockchain ventures. Earlier this year, Block released its physical hardware crypto wallet, BitKey, to help diversify its customer base beyond those comfortable enough to hold coins in Cash App. Perhaps noting increased consumer concerns following the FTX debacle, Block is rapidly positioning itself as an all-weather crypto player to differentiate itself in the long term.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock finally broke free from its sub-$25 trading range, and many investors are noticing. But, for those paying attention, Palantir always counted itself among the ranks of quality buy-and-hold stocks, even if per-share pricing volatility made short-term trading tough.\n\nPalantir\u2019s biggest strength today is rapid diversification beyond government contracting; government contracts offer decent money and long-term sales, and staking your operational future on just a few clients \u2014 even governmental \u2014 is risky. But Palantir is seeing success compound across its corporate client list, creating a snowball effect as it delivers value to private firms as diverse as Tampa General Hospital, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), AARP, and even Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN).\n\nPalantir\u2019s operational model creates a certain amount of entrenchment and high switching costs; in other words, once a company relies on what Palantir offers, they\u2019re unlikely to move to a competitor. A wider range of corporate clients both diversifies and extends Palantir\u2019s sales streams, compounding Palantir\u2019s status among buy-and-hold stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nFew stocks capture as wide a swath of the sustainable and green energy sectors as Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), making it a top buy and hold stock for sustainability-minded investors.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners holds a diverse portfolio of smaller renewable energy companies worldwide, focusing on long-term value rather than short-term gains. That trait makes it stand out among even the most forward-thinking buy-and-hold stocks. Brookfield\u2019s portfolio includes hydroelectric power, wind, utility-scale solar, and energy distribution solutions. This diversity helps investors to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies in specific sectors while aligning with the broader sustainability movement.\n\nManagement aims for a 12% to 15% total return by enhancing existing assets and securing market deals, creating a long-term compounding effect for buy-and-hold investors. Since Brookfield Renewable\u2019s parent company often deals with distressed debt investments, the current economic climate means plenty of new opportunities for management to set itself up for long-term momentum.\n\nSmaller firms struggling to raise capital or manage debt may find themselves attractive merger and acquisition targets for Brookfield, a trend we\u2019re already seeing accelerate.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime choice for long-term buy-and-hold stocks, combining smart financial management, significant long-term growth potential, and innovative leadership that continues to push boundaries despite its size \u2014 a distinction not as evident in companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategic positioning in the AI sector may be the next catalyst to propel shares higher. While skepticism about more ambitious AI claims is understandable, the technology undeniably challenges traditional search engines and introduces new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft\u2019s existing software suite. Microsoft\u2019s hefty investment in OpenAI, the leading AI firm, secures it a front-row seat and early entrant advantage in developing the next major technological breakthrough.\n\nToday is reminiscent of the early 2000s when search engine technology was on the horizon, but consumers didn\u2019t realize its enormous potential and profitability. Among public companies, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this future potential, making it a top buy-and-hold stock for a forward-thinking investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in MKL.

He predicts this trend will be driven by the increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) through consumer electronics.\n\nEisman, known for his successful \"Big Short\" bet against subprime mortgages before the global financial crisis, suggests that consumers' desire for new AI applications on smartphones and personal computers will trigger the \"biggest refresh cycle in history.\" This wave of upgraded device purchases will likely benefit tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro!

He points out that the company's earnings have tripled, making it a sound investment. Eisman has previously disclosed that he owns a substantial amount of Nvidia shares.\n\nEisman also shared his views on the broader economy, stating that although it's slowing down, the situation is stable. He sees no fundamental reason to short stocks significantly.\n\nReflecting on his past experiences, Eisman said, \"I predicted the end of the world once \u2014 it was pretty awful for everybody. I have no interest in predicting it again and there's no data to show that it's going to happen.\"\n\nRegarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Eisman believes there are times to short the company when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, he concedes that this becomes challenging when investors focus on Tesla's self-driving car and AI ambitions rather than its fundamentals. Eisman clarified that while he doesn't short for his clients, he occasionally does so on a personal basis.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSteve Eisman: Big tech dominance to continue, predicts Trump victory\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Key Republican lawmakers asked the Biden administration to prepare a formal intelligence community assessment of a budding partnership between Microsoft Corp. and Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, with a focus on the Emirati company\u2019s ties to China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Modi\u2019s Embrace of Putin Irks Biden Team Pushing Support for Kyiv Archegos\u2019 Bill Hwang Convicted of Fraud, Market Manipulation Biden Aides to Meet Senators After Pelosi Remarks Deal Blow NATO Singles Out China Over Its Support for Russia in Ukraine\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul and John Moolenaar, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Select Committee on China, respectively, detailed their concerns about the deal in a Wednesday letter to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.\n\n\u201cWe support your efforts to work hand in glove with U.S. companies like Microsoft to strengthen our dominance in AI; however, we must also be cleareyed about the risks posed by transferring our most critical AI technology particularly when it comes to countries where the PRC is active,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nMicrosoft announced in April that it would invest $1.5 billion in G42. Under the agreement, Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the UAE firm\u2019s board and G42 will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud for its AI applications. The deal was supported by the Biden administration, which is determined to bolster US AI leadership around the world \u2014 and see G42 decouple from Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nBut the arrangement quickly attracted scrutiny in Washington, where some officials had already grown wary of G42 over its alleged ties to blacklisted Chinese companies. The concerns range from the possibility of China accessing sensitive American technology to the risks of shipping AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\n\nOne key question is whether the US will approve shipments of cutting-edge Nvidia Corp. H100 chips for data centers in the Middle East. Officials have been slow-walking those licenses over the past several months, Bloomberg has reported, as they hash out an AI national security strategy for the Gulf.\n\nMcCaul and Moolenaar said in their letter that they\u2019ve had \u201cnumerous productive conversations\u201d with Microsoft about their worries. But they want to see \u201csignificantly more robust\u201d national security guardrails before the US transfers any sensitive technology \u2014 including hardware, services and research. They also called for a more formal framework around the export of chips and AI model weights.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the risks of hardware shipments, some Pentagon officials are also skeptical that G42 will fully decouple from China, a key promise that paved the way for the Microsoft partnership. A new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle called Lunate is taking over management of what was G42\u2019s 42XFund, an entity with stakes in units of Chinese tech giants such as ByteDance Ltd. Lunate, like G42, is part of a business empire overseen by United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\n--With assistance from Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs At SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving How Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla How Digital Money Really Works\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Two 80-something journalists tried ChatGPT. Then, they sued to protect the 'written word'",
        "content": "GRAFTON, Mass. (AP) \u2014 When two octogenarian buddies named Nick discovered that ChatGPT might be stealing and repurposing a lifetime of their work, they tapped a son-in-law to sue the companies behind the artificial intelligence chatbot.\n\nVeteran journalists Nicholas Gage, 84, and Nicholas Basbanes, 81, who live near each other in the same Massachusetts town, each devoted decades to reporting, writing and book authorship.\n\nGage poured his tragic family story and search for the truth about his mother's death into a bestselling memoir that led John Malkovich to play him in the 1985 film \u201cEleni.\u201d Basbanes transitioned his skills as a daily newspaper reporter into writing widely-read books about literary culture.\n\nBasbanes was the first of the duo to try fiddling with AI chatbots, finding them impressive but prone to falsehoods and lack of attribution. The friends commiserated and filed their lawsuit earlier this year, seeking to represent a class of writers whose copyrighted work they allege \u201chas been systematically pilfered by\u201d OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft.\n\n\u201cIt's highway robbery,\u201d Gage said in an interview in his office next to the 18th-century farmhouse where he lives in central Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d added Basbanes, as the two men perused Gage's book-filled shelves. \u201cWe worked too hard on these tomes.\u201d\n\nNow their lawsuit is subsumed into a broader case seeking class-action status led by household names like John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d novelist George R. R. Martin; and proceeding under the same New York federal judge who\u2019s hearing similar copyright claims from media outlets such as The New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Mother Jones.\n\nWhat links all the cases is the claim that OpenAI \u2014 with help from Microsoft's money and computing power \u2014 ingested huge troves of human writings to \u201ctrain\u201d AI chatbots to produce human-like passages of text, without getting permission or compensating the people who wrote the original works.\n\n\u201cIf they can get it for nothing, why pay for it?\u201d Gage said. \u201cBut it\u2019s grossly unfair and very harmful to the written word.\u201d\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft didn\u2019t return requests for comment this week but have been fighting the allegations in court and in public. So have other AI companies confronting legal challenges not just from writers but visual artists, music labels and other creators who allege that generative AI profits have been built on misappropriation.\n\nThe chief executive of Microsoft\u2019s AI division, Mustafa Suleyman, defended AI industry practices at last month\u2019s Aspen Ideas Festival, voicing the theory that training AI systems on content that\u2019s already on the open internet is protected by the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine of U.S. copyright laws.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe social contract of that content since the \u201990s has been that it is fair use,\u201d Suleyman said. \u201cAnyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.\u201d\n\nSuleyman said it was more of a \u201cgray area\u201d in situations where some news organizations and others explicitly said they didn\u2019t want tech companies \u201cscraping\u201d content off their websites. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to work its way through the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cases are still in the discovery stage and scheduled to drag into 2025. In the meantime, some who believe their professions are threatened by AI business practices have tried to secure private deals to get technology companies to pay a fee to license their archives. Others are fighting back.\n\n\u201cSomebody had to go out and interview real people in the real world and conduct real research by poring over documents and then synthesizing those documents and coming up with a way to render them in clear and simple prose,\u201d said Frank Pine, executive editor of MediaNews Group, publisher of dozens of newspapers including the Denver Post, Orange County Register and St. Paul Pioneer Press. The newspaper chain sued OpenAI in April.\n\n\u201cAll of that is real work, and it\u2019s work that AI cannot do,\" Pine said. \"An AI app is never going to leave the office and go downtown where there\u2019s a fire and cover that fire.\u201d\n\nDeemed too similar to lawsuits filed late last year, the Massachusetts duo's January complaint has been folded into a consolidated case brought by other nonfiction writers as well as fiction writers represented by the Authors Guild. That means Gage and Basbanes won't likely be witnesses in any upcoming trial in Manhattan's federal court. But in the twilight of their careers, they thought it important to take a stand for the future of their craft.\n\nGage fled Greece as a 9-year-old, haunted by his mother's 1948 killing by firing squad during the country's civil war. He joined his father in Worcester, Massachusetts, not far from where he lives today. And with a teacher's nudge, he pursued writing and built a reputation as a determined investigative reporter digging into organized crime and political corruption for The New York Times and other newspapers.\n\nBasbanes, as a Greek American journalist, had heard of and admired the elder \u201chotshot reporter\u201d when he got a surprise telephone call at his desk at Worcester's Evening Gazette in the early 1970s. The voice asked for Mr. Basbanes, using the Greek way of pronouncing the name.\n\n\u201cYou were like a talent scout,\u201d Basbanes said. \u201cWe established a friendship. I mean, I\u2019ve known him longer than I know my wife, and we\u2019ve been married 49 years.\u201d\n\nBasbanes hasn\u2019t mined his own story like Gage has, but he says it can sometimes take days to craft a great paragraph and confirm all of the facts in it. It took him years of research and travel to archives and auction houses to write his 1995 book \u201cA Gentle Madness\u201d about the art of book collection from ancient Egypt through modern times.\n\n\u201cI love that \u2018A Gentle Madness\u2019 is in 1,400 libraries or so,\u201d Basbanes said. \u201cThis is what a writer strives for -- to be read. But you also write to earn, to put food on the table, to support your family, to make a living. And as long as that\u2019s your intellectual property, you deserve to be compensated fairly for your efforts.\u201d\n\nGage took a great professional risk when he quit his job at the Times and went into $160,000 debt to find out who was responsible for his mother's death.\n\n\u201cI tracked down everyone who was in the village when my mother was killed,\" he said. \u201cAnd they had been scattered all over Eastern Europe. So it cost a lot of money and a lot of time. I had no assurance that I would get that money back. But when you commit yourself to something as important as my mother\u2019s story was, the risks are tremendous, the effort is tremendous.\u201d\n\nIn other words, ChatGPT couldn't do that. But what worries Gage is that ChatGPT could make it harder for others to do that.\n\n\u201cPublications are going to die. Newspapers are going to die. Young people with talent are not going to go into writing,\u201d Gage said. \u201cI'm 84 years old. I don\u2019t know if this is going to be settled while I\u2019m still around. But it\u2019s important that a solution be found.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article looks at the most advanced country in Asia in 2024. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nA report by McKinsey in 2020 highlighted the progress made by Asia in technology and innovation over the past decade, accounting for 52% of the global growth in technology companies' revenues. The continent\u2019s share of the new unicorns established between 2012 and 2020 stood at 36%, an improvement from the decade prior when the contribution was measured at 29%.\n\nMoreover, Asia also represented 51% of the global growth in R&D expenditure during the period, led the world when it came to growth in the number of patents, and also contributed significantly toward the increase in science and engineering research articles published. Between 2016 and 2018, three-fourths of the world\u2019s STEM education graduates came from India, while in 2020, Asia went past Europe in combating climate change, emerging as the global leader in renewable technology with an installation capacity of 45%.\n\nThe advancements in technology and innovation have fueled economic growth in the region, where technology has widely been deployed across sectors, driving enhanced productivity in the corporate sphere, and boosting economic development and public service delivery at a macro level. Many Western observers have already dubbed the 21st century Asia\u2019s century, and the continent now seems to be catching up to the expectations faster than anticipated.\n\nAsia, which accounted for less than one-third of the global economy in purchasing power parity terms in 2000 is now on track to represent more than half of the world\u2019s GDP by 2040, as per a report by McKinsey. The continent is also expected to represent more than 40% of the global consumption by then. Furthermore, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, China and India are set to go past the United States as the world's first and second largest economies by 2050, with the Chinese alone forecasted to make up 20% of the global economy over the next three decades.\n\nSeveral large Western corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have made inroads in the continent by outsourcing some of their key operations to Asia to tap into the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge markets, coupled with making the most of the cheap, skillful labor that is available in abundance in the region. About 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks are manufactured in China, today. The country, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the source of 19% of the tech giant\u2019s revenue during the fiscal year 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently further expanded its presence in Asia through its new stores opening in India and Malaysia.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in the continent have seen an uptick in Asia, with the company, in 2021, announcing the establishment of a new data center in Indonesia. The new setup is likely to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. On the other hand, the International Data Corporation (IDC) expects Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to add 100,000 new jobs and $39 billion to the United Arab Emirates\u2019 economy through its cloud-based services between 2022 and 2026.\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute a whopping $19 trillion to the global economy every year. The continent is home to many of the largest corporations in the world, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a dominant player in the global foundry industry, accounting for 60% of all output. It is currently the third-best hardware stock to buy now, with 135 hedge funds bullish about the company, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database as of the first quarter of 2024. During May, the company\u2019s revenue grew 30% to a total of $7.1 billion, driven by ASML\u2019s announcement to ship its advanced high NA EUV scanner to TSM. The machine is crucial to future manufacturing technologies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has a forward P/E ratio of 26 at par with the industry average.\n\nJapanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) has a share of 11.5% of the world\u2019s automobile industry. The company sold a record 11.2 million cars worldwide in 2023, which helped Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) to retain its status as the world\u2019s top car maker for a fourth successive year. On the other hand, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) continues to remain a major force in the e-commerce market, controlling more than 50% of China\u2019s online retail industry. The Most Advanced Country in Asia in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked the most advanced countries in Asia in 2024 based on three weighted metrics: technological advancement, R&D expenditure as a share of the GDP (during the latest year for which data is available), and their level of human development. The weights, in order, were 40%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Data was sourced from WIPO\u2019s 2023 Global Innovation Index (GII), the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a particular metric and accordingly, it was assigned a weighted score. We then summed the weighted scores for each metric to get an overall score. The 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024 are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

        "title": "The PC industry is finally on the path to recovery",
        "content": "The turnaround in the global PC market continues to gain speed as hype around AI PCs grows and enterprise customers start to pick up purchases of laptops and desktops. According to early data from market research firm IDC, the PC market grew 3%, marking the second quarter of growth after a staggering seven consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nWhile that\u2019s higher than the 1.9% growth rival firm Gartner says the market saw in the quarter, both numbers point to a recovery in a sector that was crushed after it saw sales pulled forward at the start of the pandemic, which suppressed sales in subsequent quarters.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the PC market, just like other technology markets, faces challenges in the near term due to maturity and headwinds,\" said IDC group vice president Ryan Reith.\n\n\"However, two consecutive quarters of growth, combined with plenty of market hype around AI PCs and a less sexy but arguably more important commercial refresh cycle, seems to be what the PC market needed. The buzz is clearly around AI, but a lot is happening with non-AI PC purchasing to make this mature market show signs of positivity.\"\n\nIn Q1 2023, Gartner reported that PC shipments collapsed a stunning 30% year over year, before beginning to tick back up in Q2 2023 when the firm reported PC shipments fell 16%. A closer look at the Windows Copilot key. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe declines were a rapid turnaround from the explosive growth the PC industry saw in the early days of the pandemic. Consumers and enterprise customers stuck on their couches for months purchased new systems to work from home and for entertainment. But with so many people buying PCs at once, there were fewer customers in need of new machines in subsequent months, sending sales into a nose dive.\n\nSince then, sales have continued to improve, as consumers have begun to replace the laptops and desktops they purchased in the early months of 2020.\n\nPC market declines hit everything from software vendors like Microsoft (MSFT), which reported Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter of 2023.\n\nIntel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\n\nThe market turnaround comes as the PC industry looks to the AI PC as the next leg of growth for laptop and desktop manufacturers. AI PCs are roughly defined as PCs that come equipped with specialized neural processing units.\n\nStory continues AMD launched its first AI PC desktop chip at CES 2024. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nMicrosoft is marketing AI PCs that include its Copilot technology as Copilot+PCs. It\u2019s a bit of a mouthful, and the company\u2019s launch hasn\u2019t exactly gone as it hoped. Initially, Microsoft was expecting to kick off its Copilot+PC push with a software feature called Recall designed to screenshot virtually everything you do on your computer, making it easier to pick up where you left off and keep you from losing your place while searching the web. But security researchers raised concerns about the app, and Microsoft was forced to pull back on the feature to address any potential issues.\n\nIntel, AMD, and Nvidia are also getting in on the AI PC push, with Intel and AMD launching AI PC chips, and Nvidia noting that PCs running its dedicated graphics chips can easily handle AI PC apps.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is also making a run at the AI PC market, launching its latest PC chip in Microsoft Copilot+PCs including that company\u2019s Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. The chipmaker promises the kind of performance that Apple has managed to squeeze out of its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops, including all-day battery life and exceptional processing power.\n\nThe AI PC market is still new \u2014 Microsoft only launched its Copilot+PCs in May \u2014 and there\u2019s still no sense as to how many users will specifically opt for AI PCs for their capabilities versus how many will them because they\u2019re simply the latest and greatest on the market. Still, the industry is clearly on an upward trajectory, and for PC makers, that\u2019s what matters most. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has successfully navigated away from a potentially lengthy European Union (EU) antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices. The tech giant reached an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon AMZN-backed trade association that had previously raised concerns about Microsoft's software licensing agreements.\r\n\r\nThe deal will result in CISPE withdrawing its complaint to the EU's competition department. CISPE had alleged that Microsoft was making it challenging for customers to switch cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services. This practice, according to the lobby group, was hindering fair competition in the European cloud market.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has not only addressed past concerns but also collaborated with CISPE to create a framework for increased competition in the cloud computing sector across Europe and beyond. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe agreement allows CISPE members to access enhanced Microsoft Azure features and permits service providers to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis latest development demonstrates Microsoft's efforts to navigate the complex regulatory landscape in Europe, reminiscent of its past battles with EU regulators over Windows' market dominance.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft's Legal Challenges Mirror Growing Scrutiny of Big Tech\n\nThe agreement marks the end of a protracted dispute between Microsoft and CISPE, during which MSFT made several concessions to address the concerns of cloud service providers. This development comes at a time when EU regulators had been informally probing market competitors and customers about Microsoft's business practices.\r\n\r\nDespite this resolution, Microsoft continues to face scrutiny on other fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is currently under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. Microsoft has given up its board observer seat at OpenAI in a move aimed at easing U.S. and U.K. antitrust regulators' concerns about the extent of its control over the AI startup amid the soaring popularity of generative AI.\r\n\r\nLast week, the company agreed to a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over allegations of discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. (Read More: Microsoft Settles Discrimination Lawsuit in California)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in June, the EU accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its other business software. (Read More: Microsoft Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office)\r\n\r\nAs the tech industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how this agreement will shape the competitive dynamics of the European cloud market and whether it will fully address the concerns raised by other major players in the industry.\r\n\r\nWhile the European Commission has stated it will evaluate the settlement's impact on competition in European cloud markets, the deal has not been extended to some major players in the industry. CISPE confirmed that Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba BABA cloud service were not included in the agreement. This exclusion has drawn criticism from these companies, with AWS asserting that the settlement fails to address the needs of the majority of Microsoft customers, who still face restrictions in choosing their preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nShares of MSFT have gained 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 29.4%, 31.5% and 36.9%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAs tech giants expand and innovate, they encounter mounting pressure to uphold fair competition, safeguard user rights and foster equitable workplaces. The resolutions of ongoing legal challenges could establish crucial precedents, potentially transforming how these companies function and engage with their workforce, clientele and rivals in the evolving tech landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Hot Analyst Upgrades That Are Moving Stocks This Summer",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has continued to receive bullish forecasts from market analysts, including recent analyst upgrades. Some suggest the index could reach a target of 6,100 by the end of the year. The optimism is grounded in the index\u2019s foundation of earnings growth, with additional support from favorable inflation news and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nThis \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario has reinforced the \u201cnew normal\u201d for three years, indicating that inflation is cooling. Analysts project that this environment will support the S&P 500\u2019s return to earnings growth, which is anticipated to accelerate in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAnalysts are raising their earnings estimates for the S&P 500, contributing to the index\u2019s upward trajectory. The technology sector, particularly companies classified within the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d continues to lead the market, buoyed by their involvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWedbush analysts forecast a further 15% rise in the S&P 500, driven by the expanding applications of AI and a resultant broadening of the market for tech leaders. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognized as enterprise AI industry frontrunners, along with Apple, are expected to capitalize on AI for revenue growth and margin expansion.\n\nKey reports from Microsoft and other prominent tech companies are scheduled for mid-to-late July, while NVIDIA and semiconductor stocks will follow in August. These reports could propel the index to new highs and sustain a rally through the summer and beyond the technical target of 6,100, with Wedbush\u2019s more optimistic target around 6,250.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal\u2019s (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock rating was raised from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cPositive\u201d at Susquehanna following analyst upgrades. The upgrade reflects PayPal\u2019s strategic focus on profitable growth, as outlined in its recent Annual Incentive Plan update for 2024.\n\nPayPal is focusing on growing transaction margin dollars, a central part of its strategy. Susquehanna has highlighted several key initiatives. These include adopting better pricing discipline at Braintree, a PayPal service.\n\nThe company also plans to offer improved merchant services. This provides security, foreign exchange, and advertising through \u201cPayPal Advanced Offers.\u201d For consumers, PayPal aims to boost brand relevance. It will introduce stacked rewards with \u201cPayPal CashPass\u201d and smart receipts.\n\nPayPal wants to grow its cross-border business with small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) through the PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP). A new feature, \u201cFastlane,\u201d aims to increase PayPal\u2019s market share during the holiday season. Susquehanna\u2019s analysis suggests that PayPal will perform better than expected. This includes TMDs and adjusted EBIT dollars in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRosenblatt lifted its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy,\u201d accompanied by a significant increase in the price target to $260 from the previous $196, marking one of the notable analyst upgrades this period. This optimism stems from Apple\u2019s strong long-term performance, surpassing the S&P 500 with a 60.79% increase over three years and a remarkable 340.19% gain over five years.\n\nA recent survey in the United States highlights privacy in AI as a crucial demand among consumers. Analysts point out that Apple\u2019s AI focuses on privacy more than Android. They believe this difference could boost Apple\u2019s market share.\n\nBrokers stand to gain from investments in larger cloud service providers. However, they face different cost pressures than these providers. Rosenblatt has increased its price target for Apple\u2019s stock by $64, which shows that the firm expects Apple\u2019s stock performance to improve.\n\nMoreover, analysts have noted Apple\u2019s strategy to incorporate privacy into its AI services. This strategy gives Apple a competitive advantage. It could lead to financial benefits for the company. This upgrade comes at a time when consumers prioritize AI and privacy in their technology choices.\n\nSAP (SAP) SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, California\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBMO Capital Markets adjusted its stance on SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), elevating the stock from \u201cMarket Perform\u201d to \u201cOutperform\u201d and increasing the price target to $237 from the previous $218. This change, part of recent analyst upgrades, reflects a more optimistic outlook on the software giant\u2019s future performance.\n\nThe firm has updated its rating based on confidence in SAP\u2019s future bookings and revenues. This confidence comes from SAP\u2019s success in moving its large, steady customer base to the cloud.\n\nIn addition, BMO Capital\u2019s analysts stress that SAP\u2019s current cloud backlog and Cloud ERP growth are crucial for success. They have also raised the price target to $237. This change shows their expectation for SAP\u2019s ongoing financial growth.\n\nThe analysts highlight that SAP is on track to hit significant financial goals. Specifically, they aim for \u20ac8 billion in free cash flow by fiscal year 2025. The positive view of SAP also connects to its strategic moves in the cloud sector. These moves should boost the stock\u2019s performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive: Armada lands $40 million in funding round led by Microsoft\u2019s M12",
        "content": "When most people talk about hurricanes, they talk about the storm itself\u2014the dark, swirling experience of watching trees fall from the right side of a glass hurricane window.\n\nBut I\u2019m from Florida and I\u2019m here to tell you: The hurricane doesn\u2019t end when the storm ends\u2014it ends when the power and gas comes back on. When I was a kid, latency was part of that process. My siblings and I would play Candy Land in the sweaty Miami dark, while utilities providers and companies scrambled to figure out who needed help.\n\nWhat do my childhood Candy Land games have to do with startups and venture capital? Well, power outages are still a problem (perhaps more so as warming oceans fuel more hurricanes), and solutions to problems are what the startup game is all about.\n\nDan Wright, the cofounder and CEO of Armada, believes that extreme situations like hurricanes reinforce the need for \u201cedge\u201d computing, the practice of processing data locally rather than sending it back to the cloud. \u201cLots of oil and gas companies are really very concerned about these types of disasters,\u201d Wright says. \u201cYou can't have any latency. You have to be able to respond in real time.\"\n\nDisaster response is the obvious application, but Wright and the Armada crew believe edge technology also has a big role to play in all sorts of remote environments where uninterrupted data access is critical. Think real-time safety monitoring at high-risk worksites, real-time emissions tracking for oil rigs, and automated operations for mines. The company collaborates with Starlink and has recently launched partnerships with companies like Halliburton and Skydio.\n\nArmada came out of stealth in 2023 and has so far raised $100 million, having just announced its Series A in December. And now, Fortune can exclusively report, it has scored another $40 million from Microsoft\u2019s venture fund, M12. Along with the funding, Armada\u2019s products will become available in Microsoft Azure\u2019s marketplace.\n\nIt\u2019s a natural fit, says Pradeep Nair, Armada\u2019s founding CTO and a 10-year veteran of Microsoft\u2019s Azure business. \u201cIf you look at all of these customers we\u2019re hitting\u2014oil, gas, and mining\u2014these guys are legacy, traditional customers and Microsoft is their biggest vendor,\u201d he says. The partnership with Microsoft \u201copens up the whole pipeline, without us needing to go through the whole procurement process.\u201d\n\nThe company declined to disclose any metrics or the number of current customers. A source familiar with the matter said that the company\u2019s valuation jumped with this extension. Still, it\u2019s a rare thing right now to see investors dazzled by a young company that\u2019s not expressly an AI startup. Sure, Armada\u2019s deploying AI, but it\u2019s not the point. So, what\u2019s resonating?\n\nStory continues\n\n\"People are thinking a lot about edge [computing] because even in highly populated environments, there's this recognition of the difficulties around power,\u201d says Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. \u201cPeople are really and increasingly concerned about how we get enough power to the edge. How do we use the data that we\u2019re pulling off the edge?\u201d\n\nFounders Fund, which has been involved with Armada since the very beginning, is among a group of existing Armada investors that includes Lux Capital, Felicis, Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Shield Capital. The startup\u2019s mission, Stephens said, began with the relatively vague idea around disconnected compute.\n\n\"I feel like every good business has kind of a funny narrative for all of the ideas that it bubbles up at the beginning,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cThen, you're popping all of the bubbles, getting down to the thing that has real product-market fit.\"\n\n\u201cThere are 100 potential use cases,\u201d added Stephens.\n\nMany of these use cases seem to be oriented around high-stakes environments, where a well-timed safety alert can make the difference between life and death. (That\u2019s especially the case, say, on a fire-prone offshore oil rig.)\n\nIs that the deliberate focus?\n\n\u201cThe problems that matter the most can only be solved if you bridge the digital divide and bring connectivity, compute, and AI to the data\u2014wherever it is,\u201d Wright says.\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\r\nTwitter:@agarfinks\r\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\r\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nJoe Abrams curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, an investment management company, released its \u201cValue Equity Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. US markets continued their trend in the second quarter and the S&P 500 Index rose 4.28%. \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d drove the rally once again. The composite returned -1.55% gross of fees (\u20101.61% net of fees) in the second quarter outperforming the \u20102.17% return of the Russell 1000 Value Index and trailing the 4.28% return of the S&P 500 Index. Security selection led the composite to outperform in the quarter relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index, while allocation effects detracted. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 5.59%, and its shares gained 36.07% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 10, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $466.25 per share with a market capitalization of $3.465 trillion.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a leading technology company specializing in software, hardware, cloud services, AI and digital applications, was one of the largest contributors during the quarter. The company continues to execute on a myriad of catalysts across its businesses, particularly within cloud\u2010based applications like Azure and platform\u2010based servicessuch as LinkedIn. For Azure, Microsoft detailed previously announced partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD to develop first\u2010party silicon chips and custom\u2010 designed infrastructure innovations, including its AI accelerator (Azure Maia) and CPU (Azure Cobalt). These advancements are part of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to enhance AI performance and efficiency within the Azure ecosystem. LinkedIn, which has more than doubled its membership to over one billion in the past four years, is expanding its revenue streams across subscriptions and advertising and increasingly disrupting traditional recruiting and training functions. LinkedIn recently passed $16 billion in run rate annual revenue, which is only ~7% of total Microsoft revenue, but if it were a standalone business, it would be in the top half of S&P 500 constituents! The Azure and LinkedIn examples are just two of many that illustrate Microsoft\u2019s ongoing transformation from an operating system to a total technology solutions provider.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 293 hedge fund portfolios held Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the end of the first quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. It was a record quarter for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), driven by continued strength in the Microsoft Cloud. The company reported $61.9 billion in revenues, up 17% year over year. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Dump Before the AI Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is up more than 50% from 2022 lows. The primary reason for the resilience of the stock market is enthusiasm around AI stocks. Excitement\u00a0surrounding artificial intelligence and its potential as a revolutionary technology have sent AI shares skyward, creating what many believe is a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. That has many wondering whether it\u2019s time to sell.\n\nValuations and investor exuberance are still not as high as they were during the dotcom crash. Yet, investors continue to wonder whether the similarities are too great to ignore. The inflation of each respective bubble was prompted by the introduction of world changing technology. Investors, eager to secure early gains, have rushed to get their piece of the pie. It\u2019s a recipe for trouble if expectations do not meet reality.\n\nThe good news is that important metrics including the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios are currently much lower than they were at the dotcom peak. The bad news is that all bubbles are different and unforeseen factors may be at play now that no one can predict until it\u2019s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is the most obvious choice among AI stocks to sell before any potential bubble bursts. One of the most obvious reasons to believe that is in the similarity between Nvidia and dotcom champion Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nCisco shares surged by roughly 4,500% in the 5-year period prior to its peak in 2000. Nvidia\u2019s Shares are up roughly 4,300% over the past 5 years. Whether it\u2019s a coincidence or not, time will tell.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors continue to bet so bullishly on Nvidia following its most recent earnings report from late May. Revenue surged by more than 250% on a year-over-year basis. Sales reached $26 billion, $22.6 billion of which came from data center sales. It all continues to suggest that Nvidia is one of the best investments in AI which is largely seen as a commodity akin to gold for the digital age.\n\nYet, questions remain about Nvidia and how truly the company is capturing the current opportunity. The truth is that over the past five years Nvidia\u2019s asset growth has outpaced its revenue growth substantially. That\u2019s a real sign that Nvidia\u2019s big bet on AI has not yet produced as substantial results as some may believe. If you need a reason to sell, take that as your signal.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cursory glance at the stock chart of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shows that there are real concerns about a current AI bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare prices surged above $1,800 by mid June and promptly retreated back below $1,600 one week later. That jump and subsequent decline was seen across most of the AI sector and was a representation of broadly held questions by AI investors. Share prices have rebounded since but the volatility is a clear indication that investors recognize Broadcom may be in the midst of an AI fueled bubble.\n\nBroadcom isn\u2019t a pure play AI stock but the company did mention \u2018AI\u2019 51 times in its most recent earnings call. So AVGO may well be the beneficiary of a halo effect surrounding all things AI.\n\nThere are indications that Broadcom internally feels that its share price can\u2019t grow much further. The company has chosen to implement a 10-for-one forward stock split. Such a stock split does nothing to change the fundamentals of the underlying company and primarily serves to increase prices due to psychological effects. Management\u2019s decision to implement the forward split should serve as a clue to investors to sell.\n\nFundamentals based screening tools suggest Broadcom is significantly overvalued at present. It\u2019s clearly benefiting from the AI halo effect and is at risk as such.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has come back to life following the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC24). AI is partially responsible for the resurgence in share prices at Apple indicating it is highly exposed to AI bubble hype.\n\nApple introduced two things at the briefly held conference on June 10. Those big upgrades include iOS 18 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. The company\u2019s massive user base is now poised to receive years of upgrades. That promises to send share prices higher. However, a question arises: how much of that recent surge in share prices is simply AI hype?\n\nIt is of course a question that no one can answer currently. Nevertheless, investors remain somewhat cautious. Apple\u2019s revenues are still not as strong as they were a year ago. So, while the introduction of iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence is promising, the company is still facing an uphill battle.\n\nApple continues to produce substantial cash flows that allow it to satisfy shareholders but if its generative AI efforts prove fruitless it won\u2019t be able to substantiate share prices at this level moving forward.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) might not look the way investors expect it to.\n\nIf AMD\u2019s AI bubble bursts it will really be about investor perception of the company\u2019s inability to capture a greater percentage of sales from Nvidia. The point here is that some analysts see indications of that sort of weak competitiveness indicated at price levels between $116 and $132.\n\nThose price levels may be much higher than many would expect following a bubble burst. Yet, that\u2019s exactly where technical analysts see AMD falling to if it continues to be ineffective in clawing away market share from Nvidia.\n\nAMD Shares are up roughly 14% year-to-date. Those same shares rose from $140 at New Year\u2019s to more than $210 by early March. They now trade for $160. AMD is expected to grow revenues by 14% in 2024. If investors are judging the stock\u2019s performance relative to sales, there might be very little reason to invest in AMD currently.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is ever a stock to sell. It has provided 10X returns over the past decade and Windows and Office continue to provide a fortress of strength in which the company dwells.\n\nDespite those obvious strengths there are concerns that Microsoft is overpriced at the moment primarily due to AI. Any investor has simply to look at the company\u2019s current P/E ratio of 39x, well above its 10-year median.\n\nHow much of that increase in valuation is justified? Is the $30 CoPilot add on worth it? No one really knows because as my colleague Dana Blankenhorn pointed out, Microsoft didn\u2019t break out its performance.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella was happy to boast about its initial uptake earlier this year but not much else has been said since. That\u2019s a troublesome sign. Microsoft is well protected by Windows and Office so any AI bubble burst won\u2019t crush it. However, it may not be a bad time to reap profits now as bubble questions continue to swirl.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has sunken like a stone in 2024. Therefore, it probably won\u2019t be too difficult to persuade readers to avoid it moving forward.\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Intel due to AI earlier in the year. Intel announced the launch of a systems foundry designed for the AI era in February. That was around the tail end of the time during which Intel was seen as a legitimate competitor to Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Intel lags well behind Nvidia when it comes to AI chips. Intel\u2019s leading chip is called Gaudi-3. Those chips are supposed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chips which will be released around the same time. The problem is that Intel\u2019s chips are not nearly as powerful.\n\nThe result is that Intel\u2019s opportunity to benefit from the AI halo may already be over. Furthermore, Intel\u2019s revenues peaked in 2021. They\u2019re not expected to rebound to those levels until 2028.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a stock that is at once one of the best investments and one of those which is most exposed to the AI bubble.\n\nIt is one of the best investments at the moment because it is so exposed to the AI opportunity. Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing serves as the world\u2019s foundry, producing the world\u2019s most advanced chips including those for AI applications. It is because of that excellent positioning that the stock has grown by nearly 80% in 2024.\n\nThe flip side of that tremendous growth is obvious: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also heavily exposed to the inherent dangers of an AI bubble. Given that TSM provides the actual chips sold by Nvidia, AMD and many others, it stands to be punished heavily if and when things go wrong.\n\nTSM\u2019s P/E ratio is currently the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s more than double its median over the last decade. That\u2019s a bit worrisome given the fact that the company has been the foundry to the world during that period. The hype around AI is the clear reason it\u2019s become so valuable in 2024. As questions continue to swirl about the true value of AI, TSM will continue to be on bubble watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Gems Poised for 100% Gains in 18 Months",
        "content": "Finding undervalued growth stocks in the middle of a bull market is no easy task. By definition, they are investments rising in value over time. With the S&P 500 trading up about 25% so far this year, locating these discounted hidden gems remains a challenge but doable.\n\nJust because a growth stock has gained in value doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t keep rising. Letting your winners run is a valid investment strategy because, like Newton\u2019s Law of Motion, an object in motion tends to remain in motion. Unless a calamity strikes these growth stocks, there is a good chance they will keep right on rising.\n\nTheir growth also doesn\u2019t mean they are anywhere near full valuation. A growth stock\u2019s expansion may be outpacing the multiple the market is assigning. That\u2019s the type of undervalued growth stock we\u2019re looking for: its fundamentals are in place and widening just as it is beginning to realize its full potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three undervalued growth stocks that fit the bill. Let\u2019s dive in to see why they should be able to double in value by the end of 2025.\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (TKC) Multiple hands holding up their cell phones\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first question you might have about Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (NYSE:TKC) is: who? The company is the leading mobile phone operator in Turkey but also provides broadband services to consumers and businesses, digital payment systems, cloud services and data center operations.\n\nTurkey is an important emerging market that saw its economy expand 4.5% in 2023 despite a major earthquake early in the year that killed over 53,000 people and injured more than 107,000 people. Between 2002 and 2022, Turkey\u2019s GDP increased by an average of 5.4% a year. Although economic growth is expected to slow this year to 3%, the World Bank expects \u201crobust\u201d growth in the years ahead.\n\nTurkcell has been in business for 30 years, originally as a telecom operator but evolving into a significant technology provider. Its stock is up 71% in 2024 and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Shares go for just eight times next year\u2019s earnings estimates and Wall Street forecasts profits will rapidly expand at a 31% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). TKC stock trades at a tiny fraction of that growth while going for less than twice its sales and a bargain-basement 5x free cash flow (FCF).\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri might not be a household name but is a dramatically undervalued growth stock. It should readily double from its current $8 per share level, making it one of the best undervalued growth stocks to pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenesis Energy (GEL) Pipelines in the desert\n\nSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Genesis Energy\u2019s (NYSE:GEL) name might make you think it is a utility, in reality it is a midstream operator in the oil and gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, Genesis operates primarily around the Gulf coast region. It has one of the largest offshore pipeline networks in the Deepwater area; is one of the biggest sodium and soda ash producers; and is one of the largest crude and petroleum transportation providers serving\u00a0 two of the largest refinery complexes in the U.S.\n\nBecause it operates under long-term take-or-pay contracts, it means Genesis gets paid regardless of whether its customers accept delivery of its products or services or not. Those superlatives are not going without notice.\n\nThe midstream operator\u2019s stock is up 24% in 2024 and\u00a048% over the past year. Yet shares trade at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales and projected earnings growth. Those profits are forecast to expand by 44% annually for the next five years.\n\nThe one complicating factor for Genesis investors is it is organized as a master limited partnership (MLP). That introduces potentially complex tax issues depending upon whether you invest through a taxable brokerage account or in an IRA. But if the stock meets your individual needs, GEL is an undervalued growth stock ready to double.\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) two businesspeople sit at a table stacking up coins in the shape of an ascending bar chart. overlooked growth stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArguably the most surprising undervalued growth stock to buy is iShares S&P Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks large U.S. companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. Basically, it is an ETF growth stock tracking growth stocks.\n\nWhat makes IVW a stock to buy is the likelihood the broad market itself will continue to appreciate in value. Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell just said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach regarding inflation. What it sees so far is positive. That suggests the Fed could cut interest sooner than expected, which could unleash a massive groundswell of economic expansion.\n\nBy investing in the ETF, you get broad exposure to leading growth stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), its three largest holdings. With a minuscule expense ratio of 0.18%, you also get them at low cost.\n\nA single share of Microsoft stock goes for $460 per share versus IVW trading for less than $100 a pop. That means you can own a basket of the biggest growth stocks on the market at a significantly cheaper price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Most investors are primarily concerned with building long-term wealth as opposed to capturing quick gains. Of course, those same investors would gladly reap short-term gains if they were reliable, but they aren\u2019t. It remains incredibly difficult to identify stocks that will perform well over the short term. Yet, identifying stocks with the potential to create long-term wealth has proven easier.\n\nGiven time, companies with readily identifiable fundamental strengths tend to increase in value. These are the kinds of stocks you\u2019re likely to find recommended by value investors such as Warren Buffett.\n\nInvesting in strong companies with durable competitive advantages is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. These are the kind of companies that routinely maintain strong pricing advantages over the long term that create all kinds of beneficial internal economics. The companies discussed below certainly benefit from those factors and more, which is the reason to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) microsoft stock\n\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best reasons to believe Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock will continue to create long-term wealth for investors is its forecast growth.\n\nMicrosoft reported just under $212 billion in sales in 2023. That figure is expected to approximately double by 2028. Given how successful the company has been in investing in artificial intelligence, it\u2019s easy to see why Microsoft continues to be so loved.\n\nIt is one of the so-called hyperscaler companies looking to commoditize artificial intelligence. It is doing so by buying up massive quantities of AI chips and implementing them at its data centers.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more a part of our lives Microsoft should become that much more valuable.\n\nThe strategy is highly logical and is part of a broader thinking that characterizes AI as the new digital gold. Outside of AI, Microsoft continues to be subsidized by the strength of its Office and Windows products. Microsoft has multiple ways to continue winning and creating long-term wealth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another strong choice for investors looking for stocks that will create long-term wealth. I believe many investors automatically discount Amazon and other similarly sized companies for the simple fact that they believe past growth is not replicable.\n\nAfter all, Amazon reported $574 billion in revenues in 2023. It\u2019s therefore easy to presume growth will slow due to reaching such a massive scale. Yet, it\u2019s possible that Amazon could reach $1 trillion in sales by 2028. It is predicted to come very close as it will grow by roughly 70% over that period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat I particularly like about Amazon is the company\u2019s substantial investment in Anthropic, for which it recently completed its $4 billion investment. I believe Amazon will benefit substantially from that investment as Anthropic is noted to take a slower, more pragmatic approach to AI development than rival OpenAI. That developmental approach is likely to yield better results in the enterprise space, which requires greater accuracy and where substantial revenues will flow from.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has long proven capable of creating long-term wealth. It is primarily an income-producing stock with much of its long-term wealth-creating ability coming from dividends. However, it also produces substantial share price gains as oil prices peak.\n\nWe now may be entering another such period as Brent crude surges past $86 per barrel. Analysts believe that it could peak above $90. Standard Chartered says the current supply deficit characterizing the third quarter will spill into the fourth quarter. That suggests Exxon Mobil will perform strongly throughout the remainder of 2024.\n\nAnd while investors should be able to capitalize on those supply shortfalls, there are other reasons to like ExxonMobil. Most investors will compare it to Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the other common Big Oil choice. But with a choice between the two, Exxon is better at creating more value than Chevron. The peak oil argument was overdone and companies like ExxonMobil continue to have the ability to create long-term wealth for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Eir Nols\u00f8e reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe number of UK millionaires is expected to shrink by 17pc between 2023 and 2028, according to Swiss investment bank UBS, which published its research just days after Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s landslide victory.\n\nIts annual Global Wealth Report revealed that around 519,000 millionaires are expected to quit the UK over the period, which is the most pronounced drop of all the countries it tracks.\n\nThis will take the country\u2019s total tally to 2.5 million.\n\nThe Netherlands is the only other country expected to post a decline, although its drop is much smaller at 4pc.\n\nBy contrast, countries like Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand are among those with the sharpest rises.\n\nThe projection comes as Britain\u2019s high earners fear a series of new wealth taxes under Labour, alongside a renewed crackdown on non-doms.\n\nHowever, Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global, said the reasons for the drop went beyond just higher taxes.\n\nRead the full story...\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Szu Ping Chan reports:\n\nCatherine Mann\u00a0said the rising cost of services such as airfares and restaurant bills and ongoing \u201clabour market tightness\u201d meant wages were still rising at a pace that was not consistent with the Bank\u2019s 2pc inflation target.\n\nMs Mann also described the drop in inflation back to 2pc in May as \u201ctouch and go\u201d as she warned price rises were likely to climb again in the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cUntil I see some sustained deceleration in services prices, I\u2019m really not in a position [to cut rates],\u201d she said.\n\nEchoing comments made by Bank\u2019s chief economist Huw Pill, Ms Mann highlighted that services prices were still rising by almost 6pc on an annual basis. \u201cWe have to see some discipline in service sector price growth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe 2pc that we have seen is touch and go, meaning we\u2019re going to be above 2pc for the rest of the year, and that matters for my decision making.\u201d\n\n05:50 PM BST\n\nEuropean shares rise amid real estate boost\n\nEuropean shares advanced on Wednesday amid broad-based gains and upbeat corporate updates, while investors digested more comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s second day of testimony.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.9pc, buoyed by a 2.1pc rise in real estate shares.\n\nFrench stocks were also up nearly 0.9pc after falling yesterday, as markets assessed the turbulent political situation following Sunday\u2019s legislative election.\n\nSupporting share prices, the yield on government bonds across the euro zone fell in a sign of investors unwinding the political risk premium they had attached to the countries before the France\u2019s parliamentary runoff vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerome Powell said on his second day of congressional testimony he was not ready to conclude that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2pc though he had \u201csome confidence of that\u201d.\n\nMarkets are now awaiting June inflation data out of the US and Germany due on Thursday to gauge the timing of potential interest rate cuts.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\nEx-BBC boss wields the axe at CNN\n\nThe former head of the BBC is wielding the axe at CNN as the Left-leaning news channel grapples with a decline in traditional TV viewing. James Warrington reports:\n\nSir Mark Thompson, chief executive of CNN, has outlined plans to cut roughly 100 jobs as the company merges newsrooms across its digital and pay-TV operations.\n\nIn a memo to employees, the news chief said the cuts represented less than 3pc of CNN\u2019s workforce of around 3,500 people.\n\nSir Mark, who served as director general of the BBC until 2012, was appointed to CNN last year to lead turnaround efforts at the struggling cable network as it tries to navigate the shift to streaming.\n\nAlongside the job cuts, the broadcasting boss said CNN will launch a new digital subscription business before the end of the year.\n\nHe said this service will generate more than a billion dollars in revenue and help to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the network.\n\nCNN has struggled to embrace the shift to the streaming era, while the liberal channel also suffered a collapse in viewing figures following the election of US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe network launched the CNN+ streaming service in 2022, but this was quickly shut down following the merger that formed its new parent company Warner Bros Discovery.

The Fed responded by raising its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has plummeted from its 9.1pc peak to 3.3pc.\n\nPowell told the House panel on Wednesday that, to avoid damaging the economy, the Fed likely wouldn\u2019t wait until inflation reached its 2pc target before it would start cutting rates.

Lucy Burton reports:\n\nThe 4 Day Week Campaign, which is urging bosses to sign up to its second nationwide trial later this year, said that \u201cwith a new Labour Government, change is in the air\u201d.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, sought to distance himself from the idea on Wednesday, with a spokesman confirming that \u201cthis isn\u2019t [the] Government\u2019s planned policy\u201d.\n\nThis is thought to be the first time that Labour has publicly set out its stance on the topic, after facing pressure from unions and activists to adopt a four-day working week as an official policy in the run-up to the election.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nPayment problems stifle Russian imports of Chinese cars\n\nPayment issues between Russia and China, caused by US sanctions, pose serious issues for Russian imports of Chinese cars that have supplied the domestic market over the last two years, the head of Russia\u2019s car dealers\u2019 association has said.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have resorted to complex steps to try to avoid payment delays, including a workaround using small, regional Chinese banks, as the threat of secondary US sanctions on Chinese banks that facilitate trade with Russia deters larger lenders.\n\nAlexei Podshchekoldin, president of the Association of Russian Automobile Dealers, said the problem was particularly serious for smaller importers, who had seen payments bounce.\n\nThe upshot is fewer exports for China, while Russian importers lose business and possibly face added costs.\n\nChinese carmakers have already seized more than half of Russia\u2019s car market since Western competitors pulled out, taking their technology and know-how with them, after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nChina\u2019s car exports to Russia were up 36pc year-on-year in money terms to $4.86bn (\u00a33.78bn) in January-May, according to Chinese customs statistics.\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nLabour plans for living wage could hinder interest rate cuts, warns broker\n\nThe Government\u2019s plans to hike the living wage \u201ccould weigh on BOE [Bank of England\u2019s] rate cut hopes\u201d, a leading broker has claimed.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:\n\nThe Tory government raised the living wage by nearly 10pc in April, which was the largest increase since the Blair era. Labour have said that they could increase it even more.\n\nBack in June, the BOE cautioned that the increase in the living wage could feed through to wage growth more broadly and lead to upward pressure on price growth, particularly core prices.\n\nThus, now that Labour have won the election and have said that they will focus on workers\u2019 rights, the BOE may be more reluctant to cut rates until they know exactly how much upward pressure on wages could be coming down the pipeline.\n\nWe may not know the government\u2019s plans for raising the living wage until we get the budget in the Autumn, thus a rate cut could be pushed further out to the latter part of [the year], especially if the new government\u2019s policies lead to the BOE and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] raising their UK growth forecasts.\n\n04:20 PM BST\n\nBP, Shell and Total take stake in UAE energy project\n\nBritish energy giants BP and Shell, along with France\u2019s TotalEnergies, will each take a 10pc stake in a liquefied natural gas project in the United Arab Emirates, state energy giant Adnoc has said.\n\nJapanese trading company Mitsui will also acquire 10 percent of the Ruwais LNG plant, scheduled to come online in 2028, Adnoc said.\n\nAdnoc, the UAE\u2019s key revenue-earner, will retain a 60 percent majority stake.\n\nThe \u00a0plant, currently under development in Abu Dhabi, is expected to produce about 9.6m metric tonnes a year, more than doubling the company\u2019s LNG production capacity in the UAE.\n\nGas is being touted as cleaner than other fossil fuels as countries around the world strive to reduce their emissions and slow global warming.\n\nDemand for gas spiked following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with several Gulf countries looking to boost output.\n\nQatar this year announced new plans to expand output from the world\u2019s biggest natural gas field, saying it will boost capacity to 142 million tonnes per year before 2030.\n\n04:12 PM BST\n\nRevolut backer raises \u00a31.8bn to invest in UK tech businesses\n\nEarly Revolut-backer Index Ventures has raised a fresh $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) to invest in fast-growing businesses as the firm hailed the prospects of the UK tech sector. Matt Field reports:\n\nThe venture capital fund, which recently expanded its London presence with a new office in Soho, said on Wednesday it had closed an $800m venture fund as well as a $1.5bn fund aimed at more established businesses.\n\nThe new funding comes as venture investors pile into artificial intelligence companies amid a groundswell of interest in the technology. Index has backed companies including Mistral, the French OpenAI rival, which was recently valued at $6bn.\n\nHannah Seal, a partner at Index, told The Telegraph: \u201cThe UK has always been a really important ecosystem for Index. We have invested \u00a31bn into 144 UK start-ups.\n\n\u201cWe expect that will continue. But also we are seeing incredible AI talent coming out of the UK.\u201d\n\nLord Livermore, the Labour growth minister, said: \u201cBoosting private investment into the UK economy is an urgent priority for our growth mission, so I very warmly welcome\u00a0Index\u00a0Ventures\u2019 commitment to Britain and their vote of confidence in our VC sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how private investment in the technologies of the future will create thousands of jobs so people across the UK can benefit.\u201d\n\nMs Seal added: \u201cOur incentives and our goals are aligned with the government - boost the productivity of the UK and make it a powerhouse for start-ups.\u201d\n\n04:05 PM BST\n\nOil hits two-week low amid worries about weak Chinese demand\n\nOil prices hit a two-week low today, before adding around 0.4pc today after a American Petroleum Institute report came out showing shrinking US investories.\n\nTraders have been concerned about weak Chinese demand, and uncertainly over US interest rates has also been cited as contributing to the drop.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at online trading platform IG.\n\nFaced with underwhelming Chinese data, and expected supply increases thanks to Hurricane Beryl\u2019s swerving of key production facilities, oil prices briefly hit a two-week low today.\n\nThe summer demand hopes that took prices to a one-month high have been swiftly replaced by worries about weak Chinese demand. Investors continue to watch the Middle East however, anxious about the lingering possibility of Israel widening its conflict to take on Hezbollah.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nUS inflation rate will show \u2018slow decrease\u2019\n\nThe US releases new inflation data this week, which will give traders a clearer steer on the likely speed of interest rate cuts. The Consumer Price Index is due out on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report is expected on Friday.\n\nBets on a quarter point rate cut by September ticked up to 74pc, up from around 70pc on Tuesday and 45pc a month ago, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch. It comes after Fed chairmanJerome Powell gave tesimony in the US Congress yesterday in which he said that there had been \u2018considerable progress\u2019 on inflation.\n\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said:\n\nPowell came in a little bit more dovish than we expected ... he\u2019s purposely trying to signal to markets that if there is a good inflation print this week, September is back on the table as a possibility for a rate cut.\n\nJulien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said:\n\nWe expect to see a continued albeit slow decrease in the rate of inflation. In particular, price pressures should have stayed relatively elevated within services ... The direction of travel remains unchanged and we continue to expect lower inflation ahead. As such and with increasing signs that the US economy is slowing down, we believe that the Fed could be in a position to lower interest rates in September.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nChip giant AMD to buy AI startup in race against Nvidia\n\nAmerican chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said today it will acquire Finnish artificial intelligence startup Silo AI for about $665m (\u00a3518m) in cash as the company tries to enhance its AI chip capabilities to compete against industry leader Nvidia.\n\nAcquiring Silo AI will help AMD improve the development and deployment of AMD-powered AI models and help potential customers build complex AI models with the company\u2019s chips, AMD said.\n\nSilo AI will also strengthen AMD\u2019s software development capabilities.\n\nWhile the deal will not impact AMD\u2019s financial performance, it \u201cunlocks a significant amount of business moving forward,\u201d AMD\u2019s Vamsi Boppana said.\n\nAMD declined to discuss how much business the acquisition would generate over time.\n\nThe acquisition marks the latest step from AMD in a series of moves aimed at expanding its footprint in the AI landscape.

The service is a key part of Microsoft's strategy for growing its game business, which lags its rivals in hardware, Sony Group and Nintendo.

        "content": "Microsoft Game Pass, a Netflix-like service for the company\u2019s video games, is undergoing some substantial changes that are likely to rile up the always vocal gaming audience.\n\nMicrosoft has increased the price of all tiers and has phased out one of its lowest-priced options. Effective immediately, the Game Pass console tier has been eliminated and replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard, a tier that will not include day-one releases of big titles such as the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\n\nGaining access to new releases the day they hit stores is one of the biggest draws for many Game Pass members. (Existing Game Pass for Console subscribers who have automatic payment renewal enabled on their accounts will be able to continue to use it for now and will retain access to day-one games.)\n\nSubscribers to the Game Pass Ultimate tier, which will keep day-one games for new and existing subscribers, will now pay $20 a month, a $3 per month increase. The Game Pass Standard tier will cost $15 per month, which is notably higher than the $11 per month Game Pass for Console subscribers paid.\n\nExisting customers will begin paying the higher rates on Sept. 12.\n\nWhile the Xbox console is better known to many, Game Pass has become the heart of Microsoft\u2019s game unit in recent years. Sony has vastly outsold the company in the hardware space for the past two generations of game systems. With Game Pass, though, Microsoft has opened up a way for people to play its games without investing in a $300 piece of hardware. It also appeals to console owners who can play both an extensive catalog of older titles as well as new ones without plunking down $60 or more each time.\n\nIn February, Microsoft announced that 34 million people subscribe to the service, a jump of 11 million from two years prior.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

CISPE had argued Microsoft made it too difficult for customers to change cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services.\n\n\u201cAfter working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we\u2019ve not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in the statement.\n\nThe agreement will allow CISPE members to use enhanced Microsoft Azure features, with service providers permitted to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures, the association said in a statement.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said it would assess the impact of the settlement on competition in European cloud markets.\n\nThe deal however was not offered to CISPE\u2019s largest member, Amazon Web Services or to Google\u2019s Cloud Platform and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s cloud service, CISPE said.\n\nAWS said in a statement that the settlement \u201cdoes nothing for the vast majority of Microsoft customers who are still unable to use the cloud of their choice in Europe and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between Microsoft and CISPE puts an end to a long-running back-and-forth between the parties, that saw Microsoft make a spate of concessions in order to appease the concerns of cloud service providers. On the heels of those complaints, EU regulators had been informally asking market rivals and customers about Microsoft\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe,\u201d Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\n\nMore recently, its $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is the focus of an informal investigation by regulators, after concerns emerged about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology. In June, the EU also accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.\n\n(Updates with European Commission comment in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The First Porsche 911 Hybrid Is $165,000 Carrera GTS: Review\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "It\u2019s for the best that Microsoft and Apple won\u2019t be observing OpenAI\u2019s board meetings",
        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s board meetings were about to get really weird, with not one but two major customers and partners sitting in as observers. But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year\u2019s leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\n\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won\u2019t take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \u201cprovided insights into the board\u2019s activities without compromising its independence,\u201d and the role was no longer necessary because \u201cwe have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.\u201d\n\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI\u2014they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner\u2014there\u2019s now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\n\nSecondly\u2026well, here I\u2019m going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week\u2019s essay about the subject:\n\n\u201cThe issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions\u2026I question how this \u2018observation\u2019 can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\u201d\n\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\n\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of AI, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI\u2019s only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOracle is a great company\u2026but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\u201d Musk tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant\u2014a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It\u2019s called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can\u2019t wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday\u2014which appropriately focuses on AI\u2019s potential for surreptitiously influencing people\u2014and you can also read Jeremy\u2019s own rundown of the book\u2019s key themes in yesterday\u2019s Eye On AI essay.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains among the top AI stocks investors look to for growth right now. Microsoft stock is certainly among the best long-term options for investors looking for dominant growth long term.\n\nThere are many reasons for such a view. The company\u2019s core software business is the cash cow allowing the company to reinvest a tremendous amount of capital into AI integrations for its core products.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing division continues to drive vigorous growth, and is competing for market share lead in a high-profit and fast-growing space. Microsoft recently introduced Copilot+ PCs with advanced AI capabilities and continues to innovate in AI integration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese factors alone make the stock worth considering. Let\u2019s dive into a few other reasons why investors are so bullish on Microsoft stock, and why this is a Magnificent 7 stock to buy and hold long term.\n\nCommitted OpenAI Expansion\n\nMicrosoft has deepened its commitment to Hong Kong by introducing generative artificial intelligence services in education, following restrictions by OpenAI in the region.\n\nCollaborating with the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School, Microsoft integrated AI tools, including chatbots and text-to-image generators powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT and Dall-E models, into science classes for approximately 220 fifth and sixth-grade students during the last academic year.\n\nThe company also expanded its K-12 presence in Hong Kong following collaborations with eight local universities last year to promote AI services. Partnering with Gamenoodlesoup, an education and tech developer, since April 2023, the company tailored Microsoft Azure cloud services to meet specific school needs.\n\nThis is one example of many AI integrations that investors may not be aware of that could spur additional growth over time. The number of verticals in this space is incredible, and Microsoft remains among the best options to consider in this regard.\n\nAI Events\n\nMicrosoft unveiled a key AI integration using Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) processors at a Surface event on May 20th. Key highlights included the launch of Copilot Plus PCs, featuring built-in NPUs for local AI tasks like Recall.\n\nAlso unveiled were Surface Laptop and Surface Pro Tablet powered by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X processors, promising enhanced performance and efficiency. The event showcased new Copilot Plus PCs from a range of notable PC providers.\n\nCompetition certainly exists in this space, with others looking to launch an AI PC chipset in late 2025 for Windows PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, the company\u2019s status as a key PC software provider should position the company well to have its core AI technologies integrated into new machines as they\u2019re released. It will certainly be important for investors to watch how these unveilings unfold over time.\n\nAt Microsoft\u2019s Surface event, the company also introduced a lineup of Copilot Plus PCs from leading OEMs. Among them, the Swift 14 AI stands out with Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors, offering options like the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite or 10-core X Plus, with up to 32GB RAM and 1TB M.2 SSD storage.\n\nMicrosoft Stock Remains a Strong Buy\n\nMicrosoft leverages not just business software and AI but also gaming and social media for substantial revenue. Brands like LinkedIn and Xbox contribute significantly. The company\u2019s Activision Blizzard acquisition boosted gaming revenue.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s clear that there are so many verticals and business lines Microsoft can leverage for growth that investors are certainly pricing in the fair amount of enthusiasm into this stock.\n\nOver the long-term, MSFT stock has been as reliable a long-term investment as exists. Shares of this tech giant are up 23% year-to-date and 233% over the past five years. Analysts predict potential new highs with an average price target indicating 12% upside, while the highest target of $600 suggests a 31% gain from prices at the time of writing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market has shown remarkable resilience in the first half of 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs despite economic uncertainty. Chipmakers and AI-related companies have been standout market-beating stocks. Meanwhile, other sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary are also driving much of the index\u2019s gains.\n\nHere are seven market-beating stocks that have high growth potential and are starting to outperform the stock market and still have room to run higher.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a tear lately. Most growth investors are kicking themselves for not buying shares sooner. The stock has tripled year-to-date, recently hitting fresh highs above $900.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSMCI is riding major tailwinds from the AI boom. It produces critical server technology, and partners closely with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power data centers. Some analysts even view Super Micro as an \u201cAI proxy\u201d that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia starts to wane.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials look stellar too, with revenue surging over 200% last quarter. And I don\u2019t see this slowing down anytime soon. Super Micro has its finger on the pulse of several key megatrends like cloud computing, AI and data centers that should provide a long growth runway.\n\nSure, the stock isn\u2019t cheap at 38 times forward earnings, but I think that\u2019s more than justified, given the explosive growth. A few analysts have lofty price targets of up to $1,500. Of course, there are risks, but all things considered I\u2019m very bullish.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor powerhouse that provides chips for a wide range of applications. The company\u2019s stock has surged over 21% in the past month alone and nearly doubled over the past year.\n\nBroadcom recently posted a strong earnings beat primarily driven by insatiable demand for its AI-focused chips. Management is now forecasting $11 billion in AI-related revenue for the full year. Thus, Broadcom is now one of the market-beating stocks for investors looking to ride the AI megatrend alongside Nvidia.\n\nWhile the analyst community is largely bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus and a flurry of price target hikes, I do have some reservations about Broadcom\u2019s lofty valuation. The stock is priced for perfection with a forward P/E ratio pushing 37x.\n\nSo, where do I stand? I believe Broadcom\u2019s strong positioning in AI and cloud computing can power robust growth ahead. As long as the AI hype stays, AVGO should outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the company behind the current AI rally, as it initially made large investments into OpenAI. It also has productivity tools that the white-collar sector cannot survive without. It is hard to find a single tech field in which this company is not, or has not, competed.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on market leader Amazon Web Services. Azure gained 31% market share last quarter thanks in large part to surging demand for AI services. Microsoft\u2019s close partnership with OpenAI and its Copilot AI offerings are also fueling excitement. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 already using Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish, with Piper Sandler recently reiterating a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and $465 price target on the stock. However, some caution Microsoft\u2019s valuation is getting stretched, with the average analyst price target implying just 7% upside from current levels.\n\nNonetheless, I believe Microsoft\u2019s strong positioning in AI, cloud and other growth markets should continue to propel shares higher. The company\u2019s ability to drive synergies across its sprawling product portfolio is a key competitive advantage that the market still underappreciates.\n\nHEICO Corporation (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) has been riding high lately, and I believe the aerospace and defense powerhouse is well-positioned to continue its impressive run. The company recently reported stellar Q2 2024 results. Earnings per share of 88 cents handily beat estimates by 8 cents. And, revenue soared 39% year-over-year to $955 million. The Flight Support Group has been the key driver of this growth. market-beating stocks: HEI FSG segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHEICO is benefiting from several powerful megatrends in its core markets. Air travel demand has come roaring back post-pandemic. This has driven strong sales of HEICO\u2019s cost-saving aftermarket parts to airlines looking to keep aging fleets flying. The company is also seeing robust growth in its defense business as geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine spur higher military spending globally.\n\nAnalysts are taking notice of HEICO\u2019s momentum. In recent months, the stock has scored a slew of price target hikes from top firms like Bank of America, Truist, and RBC Capital. While HEICO shares don\u2019t come cheap at 64 times forward earnings, I believe the premium valuation is justified given the company\u2019s exceptional growth profile, high-margin business model, and significant runway in both commercial aerospace and defense.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has faced its share of challenges, from losing market share in desktop CPUs to AMD to delays in getting its AI chips to market. But there are also some promising tailwinds that could help turn things around.\n\nFor one, Intel is getting a major boost from the U.S. government to the tune of $8.5 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act to bolster its AI capabilities. That\u2019s a huge vote of confidence. Intel is also generating buzz with its upcoming Lunar Lake chip, which is supposed to deliver big performance gains for AI workloads in laptops. Analysts at Melius Research even predict Intel could be poised for a second-half rebound as an \u201cAI laggard\u201d that\u2019s ready to play catch-up.\n\nIf Intel can execute on its product roadmap, ride the coattails of the generative AI megatrend, and make the most of its government support, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the stock surprise to the upside. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one that I believe could pay off for patient investors willing to look past the near-term noise.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) has been riding high, and I\u2019m quite bullish on the stock. The drone and missile maker reported stellar Q4 results that blew past expectations, with earnings of 43 cents per share crushing estimates. Revenue also hit a record $197 million. Looking ahead, AeroVironment sees clear skies, guiding for nearly 12% top-line growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company is benefiting from soaring demand for its cutting-edge drone tech, especially its Switchblade loitering munitions that have proven highly effective on the battlefield. With rising geopolitical tensions, military spending should provide a nice tailwind. UnCrewed and Loitering Munitions segments have seen exceptional growth.

Some analysts argue the impressive headline numbers mask underlying concerns about profitability. Shares dipped nearly 4% after the report.\n\nRegardless, the Street is getting more optimistic, with earnings upgrades and price target hikes. Given AeroVironment\u2019s strong positioning in the fast-growing drone space and ability to outpace the broader industry, I think the long-term trajectory remains positive. This is one of the market-beating stocks that is worth keeping on your radar.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been aggressively pushing into AI, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced just yet. The creative software giant recently posted solid Q2 2024 earnings that beat expectations, driven by strong growth in its Digital Media segment. Adobe is betting big that AI will expand its addressable market with innovations like its Firefly generative AI and new AI-powered tools for Photoshop, Acrobat and more.\n\nHowever, despite the recent spike, the stock is still down by 2% year-to-date. There are worries about rising competition from rivals like Canva and Microsoft in the generative AI space. Some analysts have also expressed skepticism about how quickly Adobe can monetize its AI investments. Citi warned that consensus estimates for the second half look \u201csomewhat aggressive.\u201d\n\nThat said, I remain optimistic about Adobe\u2019s long-term prospects. The shift to digital creativity and marketing shows no signs of slowing. Adobe\u2019s entrenched market position and strong brand give it a major advantage as it races to infuse AI across its product suite. Recent partner enthusiasm around offerings like GenStudio and Firefly Services is also encouraging. While the stock may stay volatile in the near term, patient investors could be rewarded as Adobe is among the market-beating stocks riding the AI wave.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nEU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nIn contrast, the UK and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Krystal Hu and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Fed chief Jerome Powell makes the climb up Capitol Hill again Wednesday, and trading is largely rangebound on Wall Street ahead of this. Microsoft has decided to give up its seat on the board of Open AI, while weak Chinese inflation data indicates a slowing recovery in this important economy.\n\n1. Powell returns to Capitol Hill\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell returns to Capitol Hill later Wednesday, for the second day of his semi-annual Congressional testimony, this time before the House of Representatives.\n\nPowell flagged the recent labor market cooling, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as an increasingly important factor in deciding when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates.\n\n\u201cElevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\u201d Powell said Tuesday, noting that the \"labor market has cooled really significantly across so many measures.\"\n\n\"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,\u201d Powell said, after noting that labor market indicators \"have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nMarket participants have taken these comments as the Fed chief preparing the ground for a September cut, acknowledging that inflation isn\u2019t the only factor in deciding monetary policy, but will look for more refinement in his comments later in the session.\n\n2. Futures little changed; Powell speaks again\n\nU.S. stock futures are little changed Wednesday, as investors await the second round of testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 4 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, after Fed head Jerome Powell hinted the central bank could soon start easing monetary policy, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed.\n\nPowell continues his testimony later Wednesday, this time before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThere\u2019s little in the way of significant U.S. economic data scheduled Wednesday, and all eyes will be on Thursday\u2019s June consumer price index reading, which many see as a key test for the market and the outlook for rate cuts.\n\n3. Microsoft ditches OpenAI board seat\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has given up its observer seat at the board of OpenAI, amid regulatory scrutiny into generative artificial intelligence in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe software giant stated that such a position was no longer necessary given an improvement in AI start-up's governance in the past eight months.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.\n\nThe observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.\n\n4. Chinese consumer deflation\n\nChinese consumer inflation shrank in June on a monthly basis, while producer inflation contracted for a 20th consecutive month, pointing to a very slow recovery for the world's second-largest economy.\n\nMonth-on-month CPI inflation shrank 0.2% in June, compared to expectations for a contraction of 0.1%, while on an annual basis inflation grew 0.2% year-on-year in June, below expectations for a print of 0.4%.\n\nThe weak CPI reading comes as consumers reined in discretionary spending, spooked by relatively high unemployment as well as concerns over a property market downturn.\n\nThe lackluster consumer spending presents more near-term headwinds for the country, and suggests the likelihood of more stimulus measures by the Chinese government.\n\nProducer price index inflation shrank 0.8% in June, an improvement from the 1.4% contraction seen in the prior month, and shrinking at its slowest pace since February 2023.\n\n5. Crude falls on weak Chinese inflation data\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, adding to the previous session\u2019s losses as weak Chinese inflation data raised concerns about the health of the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $81.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $84.33 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over deflation in China, the world\u2019s largest importer of crude, weighed on the oil market Wednesday, although a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories has limited the losses.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories fell 1.9 million barrels last week, as the summer driving season continued.\n\nBoth benchmarks lost about 3% in the previous three sessions on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell returns, Microsoft's board seat, Chinese inflation - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean shares rise as earnings take centre stage; Powell's comments on tap\n\nShares gain, dollar firm as September Fed rate cut chances grow\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Oil giant Occidental Petroleum Corp. clinched a record carbon removal deal with Microsoft Corp. amid the software titan\u2019s push to reduce its expanding emissions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Hurricane Beryl Makes a Mockery of Texas Climate Deniers Microsoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android The End of the Cheap Money Era Catches Up to Chelsea FC\u2019s Owner Asia\u2019s Richest Banker Gets Caught in Adani-Hindenburg Crossfire\n\nOccidental, which is building an carbon-capture portfolio through its subsidiary 1PointFive, plans to build a fleet of plants that suck carbon dioxide directly from the air. Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to buy 500,000 metric tons of credits from the company\u2019s Stratos plant in Texas, which is expected to start up next year.\n\nThe deal marks the single largest purchase of credits generated by so-called direct air capture, or DAC \u2014 bolstering Occidental\u2019s position in the race to scale and monetize carbon capture technology. For Microsoft, whose push into artificial intelligence has triggered a spike in emissions, such agreements are central to addressing a growing carbon footprint.\n\nYet DAC, which uses giant fans to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, is expensive, energy-intensive and not yet proven at industrial scale. The world\u2019s largest DAC plant, operated by Climeworks AG, is designed to corral 36,000 tons of CO2 annually, far from the billions of tons required to stave off the worst effects of global warming. But if DAC works as promised, it will not only help to limit global warming but could also help improve the quality of the voluntary carbon market.\n\nREAD: How an Oil Giant Took Control of Biden\u2019s Billion-Dollar Bet on Carbon Capture\n\nMicrosoft was an early supporter of the burgeoning carbon removal industry, signing major deals with Stockholm Exergi and Orsted A/S to buy CO2 credits generated at power plants. It also inked a deal last year with Heirloom Carbon Technologies Inc. for 315,000 tons of carbon removal. Microsoft is by far the largest investor in carbon removal credits to date, having purchased more than 8 million tons across its portfolio, according to the industry tracker cdr.fyi.\n\nWhile Microsoft aims to be carbon negative by 2030, its emissions last year were about 30% higher than in 2020 in part due to energy-intensive AI data centers. Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said that if Microsoft is shooting for the moon on decarbonization, the moon is \u201cmore than five times as far away as it was in 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration has invested big in DAC, promising to spend $3.5 billion on regional hubs aimed at removing, capturing and storing 1.8 billion tons annually to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.\n\n1PointFive and Climeworks were two of the companies selected to be part of the Energy Department\u2019s $1.2 billion DAC hubs project on the Gulf Coast. Yet the companies have very different missions. Occidental is motivated in part by the promise of using captured carbon to dredge up more oil.\n\nREAD: A Startup Battles Big Oil for the $1 Trillion Future of Carbon Cleanup\n\nOccidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub has called DAC a way to produce \u201cnet-zero oil,\u201d and said some of the CO2 captured from its facilities will be used for enhanced oil recovery, which involves injecting CO2 into oil wells to extract more oil. That, critics say, is at odds with DAC\u2019s ultimate promise to limit the worst effects of global warming.\n\nThe CO2 underlying the carbon credits in Microsoft\u2019s agreement with 1PointFive will not be used to produce oil and gas, according to a statement.\n\nThe $1 billion Stratos plant, which is expected to start operations in mid-2025, also has sold credits to Amazon.com Inc., Shopify Inc. and Airbus SE. Occidental hopes to build 99 more like it over the next 10 years. In a February investor presentation, the company projected that it will be able to capture carbon at scale for $125 to $200 per ton, an estimate that some DAC experts view as \u201ca fantasy\u201d given the energy-intensity of the process.\n\nBut if Occidental succeeds, the $54 billion company could be worth $150 billion by 2050, according to BloombergNEF.\n\nOccidental\u2019s last foray into carbon capture wasn\u2019t a raging success, however. In 2010, the company built a giant plant about 100 miles away from Stratos to capture carbon from a natural gas processing plant, a process known as point-source carbon capture. That plant has consistently failed to deliver results, according to a Bloomberg Green investigation, and the project was sold off in 2022 for a fraction of the build cost.\n\nREAD: An Oil Giant Quietly Ditched the World\u2019s Biggest Carbon Capture Plant\n\nOccidental\u2019s DAC projects have also faced opposition from local communities concerned about the pipelines required to transport captured CO2 to storage sites and skeptical about the community benefits.

        "title": "Amazon launches its fourth-generation Graviton4 chip as competition intensifies",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) is launching its fourth-generation Graviton processor, the Graviton4 chip, the company shared exclusively with Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe new chip promises to deliver substantial improvements in performance and efficiency, including three times the compute power and memory of its predecessor, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance, according to Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon\u2019s lead product manager for artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\n\u201cCollectively it's delivering more price performance, which means for every dollar spent, you get a lot more performance,\u201d Kulkarni shared with Yahoo Finance at Amazon\u2019s chips lab in Austin, Texas.\n\nDemand for chips is growing as semiconductors continue to play a vital role in the global economy, powering nearly everything we use. The industry is currently valued at $544 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2033, driven by increasing demand for AI.\n\nAs a result, hyperscalers such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are creating custom chips to meet their specific needs, cut costs, and offer customers more affordable options.\n\n\"All of these companies are spending a lot of money on developing chips,\" said Patrick Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD. \"They won't talk about how much they're investing, but they have these giant R&D budgets.\"\n\nNvidia (NVDA) remains the dominant player in the AI chips market, with more than 80% share of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). But there is enough demand to support multiple competitors, according to Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nAlthough the Graviton4 chip is not an AI chip, it supports AWS's Inferentia and Trainium chips, which are focused on the technology. Trainium competes directly with Nvidia's AI chips, which are considered the fastest and most powerful in the market.\n\nHowever, AWS's goal is not to unseat Nvidia, Kulkarni emphasized. Instead, the cloud service provider hopes to offer a viable alternative for customers focused on price performance, which they hope will allow them to take a profitable slice of the rapidly expanding AI-driven chips market.\n\n\"Right now, if a customer is more focused on time to market, Nvidia-based products that we offer are a great option,\" Kulkarni said. \"There are customers for whom cost becomes a very prohibitive aspect of running their business. If they want to do more cost-optimized AI workloads like training or inference, then our Inferentia and Trainium products become a great alternative.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHow Amazon keeps development costs down\n\nIn addition to buying chips from makers like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), Amazon also designs its own chips in-house. AWS currently offers two main types of chips: those designed for AI and those made for general purposes, like the Graviton4.\n\nIn a rare look at AWS's lab, Yahoo Finance saw AWS engineers solder and test chip designs, using software to look for performance issues and fix them on site.\n\nIt's one way the company says it drives down development costs.\n\n\u201cWe can tune the product, tune this silicon, to just focus on things that really matter for customer workloads,\u201d said Kulkarni. Inside Amazon Web Services' chip-testing lab. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nAWS has not disclosed specific pricing details for the Graviton4, but the processors are rented at $0.02845 per second of compute power. This price-performance ratio is crucial for AWS, as it uses its proprietary chips to power its cloud infrastructure and servers.\n\n\"AWS customers can use Graviton4 to cut their bill for IT in half,\" said Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about providing chips to customers \u2014 AWS's chips strategy is also about using all of its chip offerings to power its own efforts, including a new large language model, a potential rival to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nMoorhead noted that while the development of chips is expensive, it can lead to substantial savings in the long run.\n\n\"Let's say you can save $200 a chip, and you're buying a million of them a year,\" Moorhead said. \"That adds up, and that's a lot of money that you can pour in to do that.\" Attendees walk through an expo hall at AWS re:Invent 2023, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, on Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2023, in Las Vegas. (Noah Berger/Amazon Web Services via AP Images) (AWS)\n\nFor investors, earnings expectations from chip development may impact company profits more than actual chip production. As AWS looks to carve out its niche by designing, testing, and validating its chips, analysts have noticed the company's growing influence in the semiconductor space.\n\nAnalyst earnings expectations are higher for Amazon than for Microsoft or Alphabet, and the profit margins for AWS alone reached 38% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\"AWS has a lot of credibility in the semiconductor space,\" Moorhead said. \"Ten years ago, I had questions about how a company like this could do chips when you have companies investing multiple billions of dollars to do that. But they are very good at it.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Cloud-Computing Stocks That Can Rain Profits in Your Portfolio",
        "content": "As the march of digitalization moves skyward, cloud computing has become one of the most relevant investment sectors. Essentially, businesses from across multiple industries are migrating their data streams to online networks. This framework presents a powerful opportunity for forward-thinking market participants, boding well for top-tier cloud-computing stocks.\n\nThe projected numbers really tell the tale. According to Grand View Research, the global cloud-computing market reached a valuation of $602.31 billion last year. Between 2024 to 2030, experts believe that the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2%. By the forecast culmination point, the arena could be worth $2.39 trillion.\n\nThe message? Get onboard cloud-computing stocks or get left behind.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no guarantee when it comes to this ecosystem or any other market segment. Not every brand will make it to the top echelon. Therefore, by diversifying your holdings across a range of ideas, you can better improve your odds. Below are compelling cloud-computing stocks to consider.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction to the field of cloud-computing stocks. Its Azure platform brings to the table a comprehensive suite of cloud services, covering infrastructural and software needs. One of the more distinct elements is that Azure seamlessly integrates with Microsoft\u2019s enterprise software ecosystem, which also includes \u201cfan\u201d favorites like Office 365.\n\nPersonally, without Microsoft, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do what I do. So, I admit a soft spot for the company. However, emotions can be completely set aside for investing in MSFT stock. Financially, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, the tech giant posted an average earnings per share of $2.82. In contrast, analysts were anticipating EPS of $2.64.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Microsoft posted EPS of $11.55 on sales of $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe that EPS may rise to $10.87 on revenue of $225.66 billion. Given the already robust performance, the estimate could be understated. Whatever the case, MSFT makes a strong argument for cloud-computing stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother possibly slam-dunk idea for cloud-computing stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well known in the space for AWS or Amazon Web Services. It offers a wide range of cloud-computing services, including computing power, storage and databases. AWS is also one of the market leaders in cloud infrastructure, commanding a global network of data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, it\u2019s a multi-variate opportunity, with Amazon also offering its mainline e-commerce business. It does so many things well, leading to an impressive financial print. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 87.3 cents. However, analysts were only anticipating an average EPS of about 63 cents. Therefore, the earnings surprise came out to nearly 48%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Amazon generated EPS of $3.58 on sales of $590.74 billion. For the current year, experts project that EPS may rise to $4.19 on sales of $588.18 billion. That\u2019s up 44.48% and 2.3%, respectively, against the prior year\u2019s results. Moreover, in fiscal 2025, EPS could jump to $5.31 on revenue of $653.31 billion.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAnother rather obvious but compelling idea among cloud-computing stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) brings plenty to the digitalization table. Fundamentally, the company owns the Google ecosystem, which provides infrastructure, platform services and also serverless computing. One of the core features of the offering is the expertise in data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s be real here \u2013 Google practically owns the internet through its search engine. I know that other entities are trying to compete in this space but Google for now utterly dominates. Because of this dominance, the company managed to post an average EPS of $1.63 in the past four quarters. This handily beat out the average analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.47. This print translated to an earnings surprise of almost 11%.\n\nIn the TTM period, Alphabet generated EPS of $6.52 on revenue of $318.15 billion. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe that EPS could soar to $7.57 on sales of $346.78 billion. That comes out to a year-over-year performance of 30.52% and 12.8%, respectively.\n\nWorkday (WDAY) Workday Layoffs. A close-up view of a Workday (WDAY Stock) sign in Pleasanton, California.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the intriguing ideas among cloud-computing stocks, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) offers cloud-based software for human capital management. It also brings to the table financial management solutions. One of the core reasons why enterprise-level clients choose Workday is the underlying user-friendly interface. As well, the company effortlessly integrates HR and financial functionalities.\n\nWith the Covid-19 crisis imposing significant changes in the workforce, enterprises need to adjust. That\u2019s where Workday could come in handy, making it a long-term idea for cloud-computing stocks. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS came out to almost $1.57. This easily beat out analysts\u2019 average target of $1.43. Further, the earnings surprise landed at 9.7%.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about WDAY stock is that it presently trades at 8.1X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric averaged 9.03X. Thus, some room for growth exists. Enticingly, analysts project that EPS could rise to $6.83 on sales of $8.37 billion. On a YOY basis, this translates to 17% and 15.4% up, respectively.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother intriguing idea for cloud-computing stocks to buy, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) provides cloud-based workflow automation software. Specifically, the company addresses needs that arise in information technology (IT) service management and enterprise operations. The company is distinct for its focus on IT efficiencies and workflow automation. Over the next several years, such acumen could be extraordinarily relevant for large enterprises.\n\nIndeed, with the global economy still somewhat unbalanced from the Covid-19 recovery, every bit of revenue and market share count. Attractively, ServiceNow is delivering the goods. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s EPS averaged $2.95. This beat out the consensus average view of $2.64. When it came to the earnings surprise, the figure stood at 12.5%.\n\nIn the TTM period, ServiceNow generated EPS of $9.36 on revenue of $9.48 billion. For the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate a big jump in EPS to $13.52 on sales of $10.89 billion. When stacked on a YOY basis, this projected performance comes out to 25.42% and 21.4% up, respectively.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in New York City, Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) falls under the application software segment. Primarily, the company operates as an observability and security platform for cloud applications. One of its distinct features is that the underlying offering integrates seamlessly across various cloud platforms. It also provides real-time visibility into application performance, providing enterprise clients with a key advantage.\n\nWhat makes DDOG so attractive to investors of cloud-computing stocks is that it moves beyond mere narratives. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 45 cents. This beat out the expected EPS of 35.3 cents. Further, the earnings surprise landed at a very stout 27.9%. The individual performances were also consistent, with the lowest surprise being 25%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Datadog posted net income of $115.28 million or 34 cents per share. Revenue in the period was $2.26 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts see a dip (about 4%) in EPS to $1.58. However, on the top line, revenue could rise to $2.61 billion. If so, that would translate to a 22.7% YOY growth rate.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bozeman, Montana, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is one of the intriguing cloud-computing stocks as a possible discounted idea. Primarily, it offers a data cloud platform which enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, according to its corporate profile. That sounds great and all but SNOW stock has courted some volatility.\n\nSince the start of the year, SNOW has printed a large volume of red ink. Some of it is due to reduced IT spending in the sector. As well, a distracting data breach incident may have shaken confidence in the underlying enterprise. It\u2019s important to note, though, that the breach is tied to Snowflake customers rather than Snowflake itself. Still, it\u2019s not a good look.\n\nHowever, up until the quarter ended April 30, 2024, Snowflake earnings had been destroying analysts\u2019 projections. What makes SNOW stock enticing is that it currently trades at 15.69X trailing-year sales. But in the past year, the market accepted a revenue multiple of nearly 22X.\n\nFor the current year, analysts are targeting revenue of $3.48 billion. That would be up 24.2% from the prior year\u2019s tally of $2.81 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Cloud Computing Stocks for Future-Proof Investing",
        "content": "Cloud computing stocks will continue soaring as businesses go digital.\n\nThe profound shift toward cloud migration among global businesses makes it almost a no-brainer to bet on the best cloud computing stocks. Cloud computing is a boon for companies looking to replace costly in-house servers with more scalable, remote data center solutions.\n\nMoreover, as we look towards an AI-powered world, we expect cloud computing technology to continue growing rapidly. Advanced computing chips and robust servers are critical in powering the generative AI revolution, adding to the allure of cloud computing stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to a recent Gartner study, 85% of organizations will adopt a cloud-first strategy by 2025. Therefore, reliance on cloud-native architectures will only become more important over time. With that in mind, here are three cloud computing stocks not only riding the AI wave but also flaunting superb fundamentals and experiencing rapid growth.\n\nCloud Computing Stocks to Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud computing arm has evolved into the company\u2019s biggest growth driver.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has established itself as a true juggernaut in its niche, commanding a 31% slice of the global cloud infrastructure market. What separates AWS is the diversity and depth of its offerings, which span storage, computing power, databases and more. Consequently, AWS\u2019s sales have skyrocketed from $3.1 billion to an astonishing $90.76 billion over the past decade, representing a 2,820% increase.\n\nKicking off the first quarter (Q1) of the year, AMZN reported a stellar 13% jump in Q1 sales to $143.3 billion, with AWS leading the charge. The cloud segment\u2019s revenues were up a spectacular 17% to reach $25 billion, comfortably outperforming the overall business\u2019 growth. The trend will likely persist, especially as AWS zeroes in on AI-driven services as it looks to continue pouncing on the burgeoning demand for powerful cloud solutions.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure is the biggest needle-mover for Microsoft these days, much like AWS is for Amazon.\n\nAzure\u2019s suite of cloud solutions, from virtual machines to AI tools, has become a smash hit among its clientele. Moreover, in recent quarters, Azure has been effectively closing the gap with AWS in the cloud computing race. In Q1, Azure\u2019s market share surged to an all-time high of 25%, underscoring Microsoft\u2019s leadership role in cloud computing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe superb growth from Azure contributed significantly to MSFT\u2019s fiscal third-quarter (Q3) performance. Revenues were up 17% year-over-year (YOY), reaching $61.9 billion. The impressive jump was mostly fueled by a 23% jump in revenue from Microsoft Cloud services, totaling $35.1 billion. Additionally, MSFT witnessed a spectacular improvement in its bottom-line, with net income and diluted earnings per share climbing 20%, to $21.9 billion and $2.94, respectively. Thus, these figures underscore Microsoft\u2019s robust strategy and highlight Azure\u2019s powerful impact on the evolving digital landscape.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has carved a unique niche in the cloud space through its specialized software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for enterprise workflow management. Unlike traditional cloud infrastructure providers, ServiceNow helps streamline digital workflows across multiple IT management functions. This approach helps substantially boost efficiency while ensuring real-time visibility into IT operations.\n\nDue to the mission-critical nature of its service, the company has grown impressively over the years. In its most recent quarterly showing, ServiceNow posted a 24% YOY increase in sales, reaching $2.6 billion. Moreover, net income jumped to $707 million, while its diluted EPS hit $3.41.\n\nThe stickiness of its offerings is shown by its strong customer commitments, with over 8,100 customers and a 98% renewal rate. Nearly 2,000 of those customers boast annual contract values exceeding the $1 million mark. Moreover, during Q1, it clinched eight new deals, each above $8 million.\n\nFurthermore, it recently strengthened its alliance with Microsoft, layering generative AI capabilities into its platforms. This partnership melds ServiceNow\u2019s Now Assist with Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, improving user support while strengthening ServiceNow\u2019s digital workflow prowess.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Summer 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is still very much alive and well, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nAt the moment, we\u2019re seeing metaverse growth in gaming and e-commerce. We\u2019re also seeing it in retail with IKEA and Nike (NYSE:NKE), for example. We\u2019re seeing it with McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) latest jump into the metaverse. Plus, we\u2019re seeing it in advertising, health and wellness, education and live entertainment.\n\nAccording to CoinTrust.com, the global metaverse market could grow 575% to nearly $500 billion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nAs noted by TynMagazine.com, \u201cAccording to Statista\u2019s forecast, the total number of users in the metaverse landscape is projected to hit almost 2.6 billion by the end of the decade, four times more than the earlier forecast and three times more than this year.\u00a0The total addressable market or the revenue opportunity for metaverse products and services in the conservative scenario, where 15% of the digital economy shifts to the metaverse, is expected to hit $1.9 trillion in this period.\u201d\n\nThat said, I\u2019d use every dip in metaverse stocks as a buying opportunity.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to top metaverse stocks, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) will always be a top pick.\n\nFor one, multiple companies are working with Roblox to jump into the metaverse. That includes Nike, Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), Gucci, McDonald\u2019s and Forever 21 \u2014 to name a few. Two,\u00a0Roblox is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse. It builds out a human co-experience platform that enables billions of users to come together to play, learn, communicate and explore.\n\nThree,\u00a0recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.\u00a0Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie initiated coverage of RBLX with an Outperform rating, noting it\u2019s one of the main \u201cbuilding blox\u201d of the metaverse.\n\nMoffettNathanson also upgraded the stock with a $26 target after the sell-off in the stock.\u00a0Better, as RBLX continues to pivot higher with the metaverse story, it\u2019s a strong buy.\n\nLast trading at $39.82, the company just refilled its earnings gap in early May. From this price, I\u2019d like to see RBLX run back to $47 a share initially.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nRecent weakness in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a strong buy opportunity. Currently trading at $128.20, I\u2019d like to see NVDA trade closer to $150 in the near term.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips and strong earnings growth, it\u2019s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real-time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its\u00a0new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nHelping, analysts at UBS (NYSE:UBS) say NVDA could earn $5 a share in 2025 as budgets for hyper-scalers begin to firm up. The firm also has a $150 price target.\n\nWolfe Research also raised its price target to $150, \u201cnoting that recent checks indicate a path to 50% or more content growth for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in 2025, with incremental upside coming from unit growth and better networking attach rates,\u201d as reported by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) Metaverse stock. gaming cryptos\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you\u2019d rather diversify with an exchange-traded fund (ETF), there\u2019s also the\u00a0Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 40 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse\u2019s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030.\u00a0Some of its top holdings include\u00a0Nvidia, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Roblox, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).\n\nFueling upside, \u201cThe Metaverse\u2019s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033, signaling an era of unprecedented expansion,\u201d said RoundHill Investments.\n\nTwo, \u201cVR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026, indicating steady industry growth and market traction.\u201d\n\nBoth could help fuel a significant upside for METV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Microsoft ordered employees in China to only use iPhones due to security threats",
        "content": "Microsoft will require its employees in China to only use iPhones due to their enhanced security features.\n\nThe move comes as Microsoft undertakes a major cybersecurity overhaul. The project, internally known as the Secure Future Initiative, comes after Microsoft faced scrutiny for its subpar security practices. Microsoft\u2019s new policy, which will go into effect in September, means that employees in China will only be allowed to use iPhones for work, as first reported by Bloomberg. The new rule is meant to effectively limit the number of Android phones used by Microsoft\u2019s Chinese employees.\n\nMicrosoft will begin requiring employees to verify their identities and use two-factor authentication when logging into their work phones.\n\nMicrosoft had to ask its employees to only use iPhones for work because certain security apps like Microsoft Authenticator and the Identity Pass app weren\u2019t available on any other operating systems in China. In the U.S. and other countries, those two apps are also available on Google Play. But Google Play doesn\u2019t operate in China, which means Microsoft\u2019s employees could only get the relevant security apps on an Apple iPhone.\n\n\u201cDue to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune in an email.\n\nEmployees in China who don\u2019t have an iPhone will be given one by Microsoft, according to Bloomberg.\n\nChinese Android phones made by companies like Huawei and Xiaomi operate their own platforms. Microsoft\u2019s banning of Chinese smartphones is emblematic of a diverging digital ecosystem between China and the U.S. where the two governments and major corporations that work with them have become increasingly wary of allowing the other to access sensitive materials.\n\nChina has its own search engines and social media platforms, where U.S. giants like Facebook are banned. Its internet censors are legendary for their breadth and strictness. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the White House has limited exports of the most sophisticated semiconductor technology to Chinese companies. And Congress passed a bill that would force the sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok to an American buyer over concerns the social media platform could be used to influence public opinion.\n\nCyber security became a top priority for Microsoft after it was found its cloud systems were breached by state-backed Chinese hackers last year. The cyber attack came ahead of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing in June 2023, further exacerbating tensions between the U.S. and China. The hack raised major red flags about Microsoft\u2019s security practices. In April a federal agency released a scathing report that found \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn March, a U.S. federal court charged a group of Chinese hackers for a separate set of cyber attacks that took place in 2018. The Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said the charges were baseless. \u201cWithout valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,\u201d Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy said at the time.\n\nAs the relationship between the U.S. and China becomes more fraught, both sides have tried to firewall the others\u2019 cyber capabilities. Since 2023, Chinese government-backed companies have ordered employees to stop using foreign smartphones from manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile China has attempted to surveil parts of the U.S. with its own surreptitious methods. Early last year China sent several spy balloons into the U.S. Even electric vehicles and connected cars have been caught in the crosshairs, seen as a covert way to surveil Americans. The Biden administration is weighing a ban of all Chinese smart cars after a national security investigation found they collect data on passengers and use external sensors to gather information on U.S. infrastructure. A recent Fortuneinvestigation found China\u2019s self-driving cars have already traveled 1.8 million miles on American roads.\n\nThose tensions have only grown after a report published on Tuesday by an Australian-led consortium of intelligence agencies including those from the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany detailed repeated cyber attacks from China\u2019s top spy agency.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Intel Is Getting Closer To Staging Its Comeback\n\nBack in 2009, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) decided to give up on manufacturing its own chips and turned to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM). Fast forward, with long delays and missteps, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) ended up with inferior manufacturing technology. But, this is set to change later this year.\n\nIntel opened up to outsourcing to TSMC.\n\nIntel has launched products on its Intel 4 and Intel 3 process nodes, but neither can compare to TSMC's best. But, Intel will be using TSMC's advanced 3nm process node for in its Lunar Lake laptop CPUs.\u00a0AMD is using the same process node for its Ryzen AI laptop chips that are scheduled for release this month.\n\nIntel is expected to close the gap with Intel 20A, which it will use for this year's Arrow Lake desktop CPUs,\u00a0and Intel 18A, which will be ready early next year. Panther Lake will use the Intel 18A process and is expected to launch sometime in 2025. Simply matching TSMC in manufacturing means AMD\u2019s competitive edge will diminish.\n\nIntel is aiming to become the world's second-largest foundry.\n\nBecoming a foundry and a world-class one is a costly endeavour, but for now, Intel is rising to the challenge.\u00a0Intel showed it is on track to reach its ambitious goal by the end of the decade, under the leadership of CEO\u00a0Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger\u2019s\u00a0bold plan has been named IDM 2.0, with the IDM standing for\u00a0Integrated Device Manufacturer\u00a0to describe Intel\u2019s new identity of a semiconductor companies that both designs and manufactures chips.\u00a0Embedded in its\u00a0bold\u00a0goals is also the promise to deliver five new process nodes in four years that will help Intel regain its process technology leadership.\n\nNew competition is looming.\n\nDuring a tale as old as time, Intel and AMD have been enjoying the PC CPU market duopoly. But that began to change when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) chose CPUs from\u00a0Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ: ARM), the world's leading designer of mobile CPUs. Arm itself doesn't face any meaningful competitors in its core market as its dominant chip designs are used in almost all premium smartphones. But, Arm is gradually lowering its dependence on smartphones by designing new chips for the cloud and auto markets. Besides this higher growth sector, Arm also anticipates the rising demand for its higher-royalty AI-optimized Armv9 chip designs to fuel its near-term expansion across the smartphone, cloud, and auto sectors. For fiscal 2025, Arm expects its revenue to grow from 18% to 27%, with adjusted EPS increasing from 14%-30%, showing its intent to gradually diversify its business is on track.\u00a0Even Intel entered a multigeneration collaboration last year. Together, Intel and Arm are co-optimizing the design technology of the Intel 18A process and Arm\u2019s chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel\u2019s long game is to become a foundry powerhouse in the AI era.\n\nBy the looks of it, AMD\u2019s edge over Intel is set to vanish.\u00a0While there were reasons to be doubtful of of Mr. Gelsinger\u2019s ambitious vision, Intel seems to be schedule with the execution of this monumental shift.

        "title": "Microsoft ad-tech subsidiary is breaking EU law\u2014and not doing right by advertisers, privacy activists claim",
        "content": "A Microsoft subsidiary is the target of the latest privacy complaint from the European nonprofit Noyb, which has successfully battled a number of other companies in recent years. And the accusations in this case are quite something.\n\nThe issues lie with a Microsoft-owned ad-tech outfit called Xandr, which offers a real-time bidding platform for online ad placements\u2014meaning it processes a ton of personal data to infer what people are likely to click on. (Note: In Europe, \u201cpersonal data\u201d means any data that can be connected with an identifiable person.) Much of Xandr\u2019s data is highly sensitive, covering things like religious beliefs, sexuality, health, and financial status.\n\nNoyb, complaining in Italy on behalf of an unnamed Italian, says Xandr violates the EU's General Data Protection Regulation by failing to let people access the data it holds on them or to erase the data. It also claims that Xandr breaks the law by doing what it does quite badly.\n\nThe way Noyb tells it, much of the data Xandr uses for targeting is inaccurate and contradictory. The complainant couldn\u2019t get their data from Xandr, but they had better luck with Xandr supplier Emetriq, a data broker that tracks people online and then sells the resulting information. Emetriq\u2019s data suggested the complainant was both a man and a woman, fell into every age segment between 16 and 60+, was both a light and heavy TV viewer, was both employed and a job seeker\u2026you get the picture.\n\n\u201cIt seems that parts of the advertising industry don\u2019t really care about providing advertisers with accurate information,\u201d said Noyb lawyer Massimiliano Gelmi, adding that \u201cthis can potentially benefit companies like Xandr as they can sell the same user as young and old to different business partners.\u201d\n\nNeither Microsoft nor Emetriq had responded to requests for comment by the time of publication.\n\nNoyb says it wants the Italian data protection authority to make Xandr comply with the parts of the GDPR that ban holding excessive data about individuals, and that any data held must be accurate. It also wants Xandr to get \u201can effective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d GDPR fine of up to 4% of global revenue\u2014and it wants the operation to finally let people access and delete the data it keeps on them.\n\nThat could be a problem as\u2014according to the complaint\u2014Xandr tells people its ad platform \u201conly contains consumers\u2019 pseudonymous personal data and not personally identifiable information,\u201d making it impossible to find and turn over information about a specific person.\n\nNoyb claims Xandr can do this, as its cookies assign unique identifiers to people. The complaint casts doubt on Xandr\u2019s claims about only holding pseudonymized data\u2014which can still be linked to people when correlated with other information, unlike anonymized data, which can never be re-linked. It also says that, even if the data is pseudonymized, the people it\u2019s about still have the right to access it or demand that it be deleted.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from reflecting badly on how usefully Microsoft\u2019s real-time bidding platform serves advertisers, this case feels like another Jenga block being slid out from underneath the online ad industry in Europe.\n\nLast year, the EU\u2019s highest court blew up the legal foundations of Meta\u2019s targeted ad business in a ruling the company is still struggling to deal with (it may soon have to actually ask for people\u2019s consent before tracking them). And earlier this year, the court ruled in a case about consent popups that a pseudonymized string of letters and numbers, containing information about someone\u2019s preferences, can still be considered personal data if it can be linked with the user\u2019s device\u2014meaning the user still gets to demand access and deletion, even if the company says it has no way of doing this.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Markets might feel unstoppable, but it's important not to get complacent.\n\n\"There's definitely some level of froth [in markets],\" Fed Watch Advisors founder Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \"There's a lot of liquidity in the market. You see speculation through these meme stocks \u2014 so that's happening.\"\n\nEmons suggests investors use this moment to reduce concentration risk in your portfolio, or take some profits in a stock that has surged this year and as a result is weighted too heavily.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit 35 record closing highs on Monday. From a trailing price-to-earnings (PE) ratio perspective, the S&P 500 is trading at 28 times compared to a historical mean of about 15 times.\n\nThe \u201cBuffett Indicator\u201d as it\u2019s called in Wall Street circles \u2014 which takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual U.S. GDP \u2014 is now at a record high.\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite indicator stands at about 196.2% \u2014 up sharply from 137% or so from September 2022 lows.\n\nThe figure is well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Apple (AAPL) have gained a cool 30% since April, allowing it to take back the mantle as world's most valuable company ($3.55 trillion market cap) from chip beast Nvidia (NVDA) ($3.15 trillion market cap).\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Apple, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are all trading at record high valuations. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up 35% of the market cap but only 23% of earnings, according to data from Apollo (the parent company of Yahoo Finance) chief economist Torsten Slok.\n\nSeemingly everywhere one looks, the market is beginning to feel too hot, given the near-term risks such as a contentious presidential election cycle. The outlook for interest rate policy from the Fed also remains uncertain, and corporate earnings are only seen rising by a single-digit percentage in the second quarter.\n\nPros are beginning to line up on the other side of the trade amid those risks, and are calling for a swift and steep pullback.\n\nMorgan Stanley's top strategist Mike Wilson warned this week of a 10% pullback in stocks ahead of the election. Wilson is among the experts on the worried about current stock valuations.\n\nAnd Nvidia's stock caught a rare downgrade to neutral by New Street Research on valuation concerns.\n\nWhile there is no proverbial crystal ball on markets or individual stocks, Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods said on Opening Bid that 10% pullbacks happen once a year on average.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe had a 14% pullback last year,\u201d reminded Woods.\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled, market-focused conversations and chats with the biggest names in business on Opening Bid.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Carbon capture firm 1PointFive said on Tuesday it has entered into an agreement with Microsoft to sell the tech giant 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits over six years.\n\n1PointFive is the carbon capture, utilization and sequestration unit of oil and gas firm Occidental Petroleum. The agreement is a part of Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030.\n\nEarlier this year, telecom company AT&T had agreed to purchase CDR credits from 1PointFive as part of its goal to reduce emissions and become carbon neutral in its global operations by 2035.\n\nCarbon credits are tradable permits that allow the owner to emit certain amounts of greenhouse gases. Each credit permits the emission of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in other greenhouse gases.\n\n1PointFive said the CDR credits for Microsoft will be provided by STRATOS, its facility currently under construction in Texas, which is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually when fully operational.\n\n(Reporting by Tanay Dhumal in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI PCs: The New Arena for Tech Titans in a Evolving Landscape",
        "content": "Tech giants like Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM and Microsoft Corporation MSFT are reportedly embarking on an ambitious marketing blitz to promote a new breed of computers known as \u201cAI PCs.\u201d These machines promise advanced artificial intelligence (AI) features embedded in their hardware, distinguishing them from standard laptops and desktops.\n\nWhat Sets AI PCs Apart?\n\nAI PCs incorporate an additional processor designed specifically to accelerate AI capabilities. This specialized hardware enhances features like personal assistants and task automation. To boost mass-scale adoption, the industry aims to offer a broader range of AI PCs and develop software that leverages the new hardware's capabilities.\n\nInitial Skepticism and Software Gaps\n\nDespite the hype, industry experts remain skeptical about the immediate utility of AI PCs. The primary concern is the limited software support beyond Microsoft's offerings. Leading software developers, including Adobe, Salesforce and SentinelOne, are yet to optimize their applications for on-device AI, favoring cloud-based AI solutions instead. Although smaller developers like Blackmagic Design and Algoriddim have taken steps to optimize their software, these efforts are still in the nascent stages of development.\n\nThe Marketing Challenge\n\nThe success of AI PCs hinges on effective marketing and consumer education. Qualcomm, the provider of the new AI chips, aims to challenge Intel Corporation's INTC market dominance. PC makers such as Dell Technologies and HP are banking on AI PCs to reignite consumer interest in personal computers. However, these companies must ensure that the performance of AI PCs lives up to the marketing promises to avoid past pitfalls like the short-lived Windows mobile operating system.\n\nPotential Market Impact and Adoption\n\nDespite limited current features, AI PCs hold the potential to drive a new wave of higher-priced PC purchases. As many consumers, businesses and schools have not upgraded their laptops since the early pandemic days, the introduction of AI capabilities could steer buyers toward more advanced models. This, in turn, could trigger higher adoption of tech-savvy AI PCs in the near future.\n\nBattery Life and Compatibility Issues\n\nOne of the significant selling points of AI PCs is their enhanced battery life. Qualcomm's efficient chips, based on Arm Holdings Plc designs, promise extended use without frequent charging. However, the different chip architecture raises potential compatibility issues with existing software designed for Intel or Advanced Micro Devices processors. While major applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop have been optimized for Arm-based systems, many legacy business applications remain unsupported, potentially limiting enterprise adoption.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarketing Investments and Future Outlook\n\nQualcomm is intensifying its marketing efforts, including a $75 million annual sponsorship of Manchester United Football Club and increased payments to PC makers for promotional support. Such sustained marketing efforts over a longer period are apparently required to establish Qualcomm's presence in the PC market for increased visibility and top-of-the-mind recall.\n\nChallenges for Established Players\n\nThe entry of Qualcomm and Microsoft into the AI PC market poses a challenge to established players like Intel. Both Intel and AMD are expected to release their own AI PCs later this year, which may offer better compatibility with existing software. However, widespread consumer and business adoption of AI PCs is expected to be gradual, with the battlefield getting murkier with increased competition.\n\nEnd Note\n\nThe push for AI PCs represents a significant shift in the personal computer market. With the combined marketing efforts of tech giants like Qualcomm and Microsoft, the AI PC could become a mainstream product in the coming years. While challenges remain, particularly in software support and compatibility, the potential for enhanced functionality and extended battery life positions AI PCs as a compelling option for future buyers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Solar Stocks Best Positioned to Benefit From AI",
        "content": "Solar stocks have been relatively hard hit due to the ongoing quantitative tightening that is resulted from high inflation. While the sector has suffered as the economy tackles inflation,\u00a0a silver lining appears to be emerging.\n\nThat silver lining comes in the form of artificial intelligence. AI seems to be the answer to every problem these days. AI is the answer to the sector\u2019s current woes because it is driving demand for solar-generated energy.\n\nHyperscaler firms operating data centers are largely responsible for much of the increased demand for AI chips. Those same firms are consuming increasing amounts of energy in building out AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, those firms have also pledged greater environmental responsibility through reduced carbon footprints. You can see the problem: They\u2019re consuming more energy because of AI but they need to figure out a way to consume less and keep their promise.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSolar energy has emerged as a viable solution. It is now expected that data centers and other energy-intensive AI applications will increasingly rely on solar power energy. That again made solar stocks a subsector to pay attention to.\n\nSunnova (NOVA) Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSunnova (NYSE:NOVA) is an excellent example of a stock that has faced a lot of trouble due to rate cuts but suddenly looks much stronger.\n\nThe company paid $371.94 million in interest expenses during 2023. The company paid slightly more than $107 million the year before that which was essentially on par with what the company had been paying for the past few years. It was a clear indication of just how drastically the rate hikes affect individual companies.\n\nLosses increased dramatically and Sunnova suddenly became a much less desirable investment. However, at the same time, Sunnova didn\u2019t suffer from a lack of demand in 2023. Quite the opposite was true. Revenues grew by more than 29%, reaching $720.65 million.\n\nNow Sunnova is in a position to benefit from the AI opportunity. Furthermore, rate cuts are expected later in 2024. The combination of those factors makes it a stock to consider for investors interested in the narrative I\u2019ve laid out.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is the stock that has largely been shielded from recent turmoil affecting the solar industry. Favorable government policies have protected solar energy producers at the utility-scale. Government subsidies have certainly favored First Solar in that regard. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from government protections that shield domestic producers from Chinese competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that First Solar hasn\u2019t suffered over the last year. The company had been flat to down over the past 12 months until this idea of AI benefiting the solar industry began to emerge. It was roughly 5 weeks ago that the notion of rising solar power demand related to data centers began to emerge at large.\n\nAnalysts suddenly dubbed First Solar an AI play citing carbon neutrality pledges from hyperscalers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) among others. Microsoft\u2019s carbon emissions were 29% higher in 2023 than they were in 2020. That increase was primarily attributable to data center activity related to the training of AI models.\n\nArray Technologies (ARRY) An image of the outline of a battery reflecting a blue sky with light clouds.\n\nSource: petrmalinak/ShutterStock.com\n\nArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) released its first-quarter earnings report on May 9. That was a few weeks before the notion of AI benefiting solar stocks had emerged.\n\nAs noted in this article, It\u2019s a catalyst that promises to send solar stocks much higher in 2024. Interestingly, in that earnings report, Array Technologies noted that its revenue guidance is loaded toward the back half of 2024. It makes me wonder if Array Technologies was already seeing some indication at that point of increasing demand.\n\nThe company could use it because although the $153 million in revenues the company recorded in the first quarter was ahead of guidance, it was far less than the $375 million in sales the company recorded a year earlier.\n\nThe company also booked $1.8 billion of new business over the past four quarters bringing its total backlog to $2.1 billion. I believe the ground-mounted tracking systems that Array Technologies sells will be in high demand as companies scramble to build more PV installations to satisfy the increasing solar demand brought on by AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Investors looking for opportunities will always be interested in high-potential stocks capable of turning $5K into $50K. Realistically speaking, securing 10x returns is not particularly easy. The most obvious route to do so is through penny stocks. However, penny stocks often produce losses and are too unstable for the majority of investors.\n\nA smarter, safer route is to identify currently strong companies with the potential for rapid fundamental improvements over several years. Stock picks within this grouping are smart choices for investors looking to turn a relatively modest stake of $5,000 into $50,000.\n\nTime will tell whether the stocks discussed below truly yield 10x returns. Investing in these stocks will lead to returns that outperform the market. In other words, these stocks are not simply moonshot rolls of the dice for investors seeking strong returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAltimmune (ALT) Light blue pills on white background. Pharmaceutical industry, medical treatment, presciption drugs concept. Digital 3D render., biotech stocks, big pharma. EVAX stock\n\nSource: Hernan E. Schmidt / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltimmune (NASDAQ:ALT) is a stock to absolutely watch out for following the success of Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) for their weight loss drugs.\n\nThe success of those companies in commercializing weight loss drugs has increased their respective share prices by more than 90% and 70% over the past year. As a result of that success, each firm has the potential to become a $1 trillion enterprise.\n\nThat has investors wondering who the next competitor to their presumed throne is.\n\nEnter Altimmune.\n\nThe firm\u2019s weight loss treatment, Pemviditude, is a legitimate threat for an important reason: It produces similar levels of weight loss while preserving lean muscle mass at rates better than the competition.\n\nWegovy has been associated with a 40% decline in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss.\u00a0Pemviditude, on the other hand, is associated with a 21.9% decrease in muscle mass as a percentage of weight loss. Thus, old immune has a legitimate chance to grow very quickly and for investors seeking to replicate recent growth at Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk it may be the best choice.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Electric car backlit by cyan blue neon light next to EV charger with cyan blue light and lightning bolt symbol, all against a black background. ev stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/JLStock\n\nShares of Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) have risen and fallen on the potential surrounding electric vehicles. Current forecasts suggest Albemarle stock will rise again. The question is more about how much rather than if.\n\nThe forecast suggests that today\u2019s investment should yield 50% returns in the next 12 to 18 months. Those expectations are strongly predicated upon the return of lithium sales as electric vehicle sales surge again.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop-line revenues are expected to return to 2022 levels in 2025. Earnings are also expected to triple in 2025 relative to this year. Projected metrics such as those make it very easy to understand why Albemarle shares could even triple during that period.\n\nYes, Albemarle is hanging on while also being fundamentally stable. It\u2019s a strong, high-potential pick for any contrarian who believes the bearish arguments surrounding electric vehicles have been overdone.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will probably raise a few eyebrows as a stock with 10x potential. After all, it\u2019s currently valued at more than $3 trillion. Only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are more valuable by that metric.\n\nHowever, investors must look at the company\u2019s potential over the next few years. In doing so, they will understand just how valuable Nvidia\u2019s opportunity is. The point is simple: Nvidia\u2019s growth isn\u2019t expected to slow down anytime soon. It is expected to grow its revenues by over 100% in 2024. Revenues are expected to double again from there by 2027.\n\nBy 2028, the forecasted market value of artificial intelligence is expected to rise to $460 billion.\u00a0 Nvidia is expected to produce $250 billion in sales during that year. One could reasonably argue that Nvidia is more than half of the entire AI market and will be so for the foreseeable future. Some analysts forecast that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion by 2030. Growth in share price doesn\u2019t have to be linear, so the transition from $3 trillion to $10 trillion may produce 10X returns.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Close up of Cloudflare logo at the Company's headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most convincing arguments in favor of the notion that Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) stock can turn $5K into $50K is pure fundamentals.\n\nThe emerging cloud security giant is expected to produce net earnings in 2024 for the first time in its history. Earnings are expected to roughly double by 2026 and then double again by 2028. Earnings are among the best predictors of sustainable growth in a given stock. Cloudflare is moving into that opportunity as you read this. Sales are expected to grow by approximately 30% annually in the upcoming five years.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare boasts phenomenally strong gross profits. The company\u2019s high gross profit levels indicate strong pricing power and an overall strong position relative to its competition.\n\nCloudflare also benefits from increasing demand for cloud security, especially as artificial intelligence grows. Overall, the company and stock are well-positioned for the current era.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) An image of a cellphone surrounded by money and shopping bags, a calendar and shopping cart on the screen; schedule payment\n\nSource: ArtemisDiana/Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a relatively unknown fintech stock worth understanding by investors seeking 10x plays. The company specializes in buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, and its shares increased in value by 330% in 2024 alone.\n\nWhile sales increased by an impressive 35.5% during the first quarter, income growth prompted the strong growth in Sezzle stock. Net income grew by more than 364% in the first quarter, eclipsing $8 million.\n\nThose strong results prompted the company to be very bullish regarding guidance. The company upped its GAAP net income guidance from $20 million in 2024 to $30 million for the year. The company also updated revenue growth expectations from 20% to 25% over the same period.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to ignore any company that increases its earnings guidance by 50% in a year. That alone is a reason to consider investing in Sezzle at the moment.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is one of, if not the most popular, language learning apps. The company has successfully gamified language learning and is reaping the benefits. Those benefits are showing up in the company\u2019s financial statements, which are impressive.\n\nQ1 revenues increased by 45%. That growth is impressive in itself, but it\u2019s earnings that investors should consider. Net income reached $27 million during that period, a significant increase over the $2 company\u2019s .6 million net loss a year earlier.\n\nOverall earnings are expected to increase by 366% in 2024. Meanwhile, Duolingo is firmly amid hypergrowth presently. While Duolingo is not cheap relative to the majority of its competitors in the software industry, it\u2019s also nowhere near record high prices. Users continue to flock to the platform, resulting in rapidly improving and strong fundamentals overall for the firm. Investing in Duolingo has inherent volatility, but it still has the potential to be 10X your money.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is one of the best growth stories in the Chinese economy, and it has seen its share of troubles lately. PDD stock is the parent of Temu, the fast growing e-commerce retailer Rapidly growing market share at home and abroad.\n\nRevenues grew by 131% during the first quarter for the firm. Those impressive growth rates are one of the primary reasons PDD stock boasts a market cap higher than that of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).\n\nAnalysts expect Temu to continue growing rapidly. They are particularly bullish on PDD because Temu recently introduced the consignment model. That model pushes logistics costs onto merchants, theoretically Improving profitability faster than previously expected. Net income and transactional revenues are both surging at PDD Holdings. Meanwhile, analysts believe that Much of the risk in China has dissipated. Combining all those factors suggests that PDD shares can continue to Surge and potentially turn $1 of investment into $10 over the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The unemployment rate is just 0.1% from causing a major headache for the Fed: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nDespite the sleepy summertime doldrums, the economic data calendar continues to heat up.\n\nFollowing last Friday's monthly job numbers, investors will feast on the latest Consumer Price Index inflation print this Thursday, teed up by testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who delivers his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the Senate on Tuesday and to the House on Wednesday.\n\nThe \"data-dependent\" Powell will no doubt do his best not to surprise investors when it comes to assessing the Fed's twin mandates of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nBut the latest economic data is ratcheting up support for the Fed's first rate cut since 2019 \u2014 especially after some surprise weakness Friday in the unemployment rate.\n\nInvestors can reasonably expect the Fed to stand pat at its July meeting in three weeks. But the odds of a September rate cut have been increasing, now standing at 72% \u2014 up from a 47% chance a month ago.\n\nLast week at a European Central Bank event in Portugal, Powell was asked point blank if the Fed might cut in September. Powell declined to answer, noting the Fed could afford to be patient given how the strong job market is slowing down only gradually.\n\nBut on Friday \u2014 only a few days after that event \u2014 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the June unemployment rate had ticked up to 4.1%, surprising Wall Street, which expected it to hold at 4.0%.\n\nIt's a small difference and only one data point. But the unemployment rate is getting tantalizingly close to triggering a well-respected recession indicator called the Sahm Rule.\n\nBriefly stated, the Sahm Rule warns the US economy is in the beginning stages of recession if the unemployment rate's three-month average has risen half a percentage point or more from the average's low over the prior twelve months. It's designed to detect an acceleration of job losses, and it successfully predicted the prior nine US recessions going back to 1970.\n\nAs of June, the reading is now 0.43 ppts. By the September meeting, there will be two more employment releases (for July and August). If either one of those prints is 4.2% or higher for the unemployment rate, the half-a-percent threshold for the Sahm Rule will have been met, according to Yahoo Finance calculations.\n\nEven if the Sahm Rule triggers, the Fed has plenty of cover to do nothing \u2014 especially in an election year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of that, Powell is on record recently saying he still wants to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably moving down to its 2% target. So if Thursday's headline CPI numbers jump substantially, you can bet that September rate cut odds would likely plummet to near zero.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the former Fed economist who created the eponymously named rule, herself has expressed doubts about the rule's effectiveness in a world that's still normalizing from record unemployment during the pandemic.\n\nBut Sahm herself has been pressing for the Fed to move soon. In a recent interview with CNBC, she said that recession is a real risk, though it's not her base case.\n\n\u201cThe worst possible outcome at this point is for the Fed to cause an unnecessary recession,\u201d she said.\n\nDepending on the job numbers that drop in a month or two, we could easily face a barrage of headlines proclaiming the recession is nigh as the focus shifts from inflation and stable prices to jobs and maximum employment. Just like with airplanes, the risks for an economy seem to increase right before landing. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities in a fresh note said mega-cap tech stocks have a 15% upside in the second half of 2024, driven by AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\n\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\n\u201cTech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\n\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong \u201cinstalled\u201d bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\n\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of \u201ctech cold war\u201d but he thinks that is a \u201ccontained threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started off with the semis, but now it\u2019s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases\u201d are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush\u2019s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others \u201coversold\u201d tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Stock for the Second Half of 2024?\n\ndrserg / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp Inc (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.\n\nMicrosoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "TRMB, CYBR, HUBS: Which \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Tech Stock Is Best?",
        "content": "The technology companies flying just outside of our radar may be the ones that have the most room to run this year. Undoubtedly, there\u2019s more to investing than just buying the largest seven companies in the stock market. Bigger has been better, at least in the past year. But what has worked best in the recent past may not continue to work so well in the future. Right now, investors may wish to check out some Strong-Buy-rated stocks for a shot at making the most of the tech-driven rally while potentially steering clear of the biggest potholes in the road.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to compare and contrast three impressive tech stocks \u2014 TRMB, CYBR, and HUBS \u2014 that have what it takes to outrun the market\u2019s current heavyweights.\n\nTrimble (NASDAQ:TRMB)\n\nShares of geospatial tech firm Trimble have been struggling to hang onto the big surge they enjoyed since bottoming in November 2023. The tech firm, which serves a wide range of industries, now finds itself in a correction, down close to 15% from 52-week highs. Despite the share slip, which came weeks after the company reported a strong first quarter (earnings per share of $0.64 vs. $0.62 expected), I\u2019m inclined to stay bullish as Trimble looks to launch new products that may emerge as meaningful long-term growth drivers.\n\nLooking ahead, new scanning systems such as the X9 3D laser scanner, which it showed off in Geo Week 2024 earlier this year, may be a timely catalyst that helps TRMB stock out of its rut. It\u2019s more than just a faster and more accurate 3D screener, though; its auto-calibration capabilities could help users save time and take a bit of human error out of the equation.\n\nIndeed, such new tech makes Trimble a niche technological innovator and one that Cathie Wood may have been wrong to trim. At writing, the stock trades at 20.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), considerably below the Scientific and Technical Instruments industry average of 19.9 times.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Price Target for TRMB Stock?\n\nTRMB stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with four Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average TRMB stock price target of $68.75 implies 22.1% upside potential.\n\nCyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR)\n\nFrom geospatial tech to cybersecurity, we have CyberArk Software. It\u2019s a smaller ($11.8 billion market cap) Israeli firm that deserves to be mentioned whenever the cohort is discussed on television after a major breach reignites interest in cybersecurity names. With various cybersecurity players in the market, each boasting unique specialties, CyberArk\u2019s offerings deserve attention.\n\nStory continues\n\nCyberArk\u2019s bread and butter is in identity security, a promising sub-scene in the cybersecurity market. As the Israel-based firm continues improving its already impressive Identity Security Platform, it\u2019s tough not to be bullish on the lightweight cybersecurity firm eyeing a vast market.\n\nDespite its size, CyberArk stands out as a market leader in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) market, which could enjoy a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% between now and 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights. With impressive subscription annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth of 60% posted last year, CyberArk looks like a cash cow in the making.\n\nAt writing, CYBR stock is close to a fresh all-time high. Shares are on the high end of the past-year historical range at 14.5 times price-to-sales (P/S). However, the rich multiple may be worth paying for such a fast grower in a lucrative corner of cybersecurity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Price Target for CYBR Stock?\n\nCYBR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 21 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average CYBR stock price target of $297.25 implies 8.7% upside potential.\n\nHubspot (NASDAQ:HUBS)\n\nHubspot stock has been blistering hot over the past two years, soaring almost 80%. Though the rally has since petered off in 2024, the small- and medium-sized (SMB) business software firm may still have legs going into the second half of the year as IT spending looks to experience a bit of an uptick. As a compelling takeover target with a great deal of AI innovation under the hood, I\u2019m inclined to stay bullish on the stock, just like analysts.\n\nUndoubtedly, recent headlines have been dominated by chatter regarding a potential $33 billion Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) takeover. Robust, AI-leveraging customer relationship management (CRM) software certainly seems to be the missing piece of the Alphabet puzzle. A deal would help it more effectively clash against some of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) rivals, most notably enterprise giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has been busy infusing AI across the suite.\n\nMore recently, reports noted that other \u201cbidders\u201d have stepped up, expressing interest in gobbling up the firm for an unknown amount.\n\nDeal or not, Hubspot stands out as a compelling software recovery play and a serious CRM market disruptor as it triples down on AI tools to help customers \u201cwork smarter.\u201d At 80.6 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), HUBS shares don\u2019t come cheap. However, if Google and others are eyeing a potentially higher admission price, perhaps investors may be at risk of underestimating the magnitude of the growth narrative.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Price Target for HUBS Stock?\n\nHUBS stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 18 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average HUBS stock price target of $681.22 implies 16.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe following Strong-Buy-rated software plays are worth checking out as they look to seize any market opportunities headed their way. Whether we\u2019re talking about Trimble and its new 3D scanner, CyberArk\u2019s ever-improving identity security offering, or Hubspot\u2019s AI-first software that\u2019s caught the attention of \u201cbidders,\u201d it\u2019s clear some huge opportunities lie outside the market\u2019s top five. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside potential (22%) from TRMB stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Microsoft intends to offer Apple's iOS-based devices to its employees in China to access authentication apps, a company spokesperson said on Monday, citing absence of Google's Android services in the country.\n\nMicrosoft has been under increased scrutiny after a series of security breaches, the latest being that of Russian hackers who spied and accessed emails of the company's employees and customers earlier this year.\n\nThe development was first reported by Bloomberg News, which, citing an internal memo, said the Windows OS-maker instructed its employees in China to use Apple devices at workplace from September.\n\nAs a part of Microsoft's global Secure Future Initiative, the move to switch to iOS-devices stems from the lack of availability of Google Play Store in China that limits its employees' access to security apps such as Microsoft Authenticator and Identity Pass, the report added.\n\n\"Due to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,\" a company spokesperson told Reuters in an email.\n\nMicrosoft is among those U.S. companies that have a strong presence in China. It entered the Chinese market in 1992 and also operates a large research and development center in the country.\n\nThe company will provide iPhone 15 models to employees, currently using Android handsets across China, including Hong Kong, the Bloomberg report said.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Top Wall Street strategist explains why he's abandoning an S&amp;P 500 target",
        "content": "Piper Sandler (PIPR) will no longer release year-end price targets for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) after concluding that the index no longer truly reflects the stock market's performance.\n\nIn a video interview on Yahoo Finance, Piper Sandler co-chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz explained the firm\u2019s reasoning.\n\n\u201cIn the last few months, as I was trying to think about raising my target again, I didn't really feel that comfortable being intellectually honest saying that I can have a high conviction view of where the S&P 500 is going to end up,\u201d Kantrowitz said. \u201cNor did I think it really adds value to our clients who are institutional investors.\u201d\n\nAccording to a note from Piper Sandler, a small group of high-performing stocks, including \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d tech names such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA), significantly influence the market's activity.\n\nPiper Sandler found that the top 10 stocks represented 75% of the index\u2019s year-to-date returns. And, as Yahoo Finance\u2019s Josh Schafer observed, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) was solely responsible for nearly one-third of the S&P 500\u2019s gains as of late June.\n\nKantrowiz maintained the importance of having a bullish or bearish view of the market and reiterated that Piper Sandler continues to have a bullish view for this year. Previously, the firm's year-end price target for the S&P 500 stood at 5,250. On Monday, the benchmark index closed at 5,572.\n\nHowever, Kantrowiz cited how investors view large caps and smaller-cap stocks differently due to their respective performances. While the S&P 500 managed to reach all-time highs in the second quarter of this year, the average stock saw a decline in value.\n\nInstead of focusing on the S&P 500, Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance that he recommends clients prioritize \"quality at a reasonable price\" by focusing on companies that outpace their peers in terms of earnings growth but aren\u2019t the most expensive.\n\n\"You kind of have to sacrifice a little bit of growth, perhaps, in quality to find names that aren\u2019t egregiously expensive,\u201d he said. \"We\u2019ve got \u2014 in the S&P 500 \u2014 50 names that have beaten the index this year, and it\u2019s not just about all AI or all tech.\"\n\nEarlier this year, multiple strategists raised their targets for the S&P 500 due to the record-breaking rally that had continued to pick up steam. Ultimately, strategists are finding it difficult to keep up, and there may be more that take a similar approach to Piper Sandler and pivot away from monitoring the index.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear to date, the S&P 500 is up nearly 17%.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, merging emerging technology fields like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) with the connective tissue of the internet. On a metaverse platform, users can interact with one another through avatars. However, it is important to note that the idea of a metaverse is still relatively novel and only gained traction in the early 2020s, driven by advancements in VR, blockchain and social media. The social media giant Facebook, rebranded as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have invested heavily in developing metaverse platforms.\n\nNowadays, as the market and technology world is reeling from the hype around generative artificial intelligence (AI), interest in the metaverse has definitely waned. Meta, for example, is looking to expand its reach in AI technologies and has put the whole metaverse idea on the back burner.\n\nThat all means investors should dump some metaverse stocks to sell. Below are just three of them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software (NYSE:U) is an online software platform that has empowered game developers and content creators to design, implement and share 3-D experiences to users worldwide. The platform supports a wide range of platforms, including mobile devices, PCs, consoles and AR/VR headsets. This versatility is crucial for the metaverse, which aims to provide seamless experiences across different devices and environments. Unity Software\u2019s deep exposure to the 3-D design space endowed the company with the right set of tools to take on the burgeoning metaverse space.\n\nWay back in 2021, Unity Software entered a partnership with UFC, which focused on bringing sports to the metaverse, allowing fans to experience live sports events in immersive 3D environments. Furthermore, Unity Reflect assists engineers in developing realistic, virtual environments for building and architecture lifecycles.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Unity Software has struggled to expand earnings and revenue amidst a broader slowdown in the gaming sector. In the company\u2019s first-quarter results for fiscal year 2024, revenue was $460 million, down 8% year-over-year. Unity shares have collapsed 61% for the year, and a shaky macroeconomic environment could continue to move shares downward.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox has incredibly transformed into a global online entertainment platform over the past several years. In particular, the tech firm offers Roblox Studio, a free toolset that allows developers and content creators to build, publish and operate 3D experiences, while Roblox Client allows users to explore 3D experience. Roblox\u2019s virtual platform thrives on its virtual economy, underpinned by its virtual currency \u2014 Robux. This virtual currency generates a high level of user engagement and stickiness for the platform, and that\u2019s key to building any kind of metaverse experience. The online gaming platform has 77.7 million daily active users, as of its latest earnings release.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, similar to Unity Software, Roblox has suffered from sluggish gains in its key performance indicators (KPIs) as gaming monetization has become difficult amidst the poor macroeconomic environment and the slowing economy. In fact, in the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, revenue and earnings came below Wall Street estimates. Roblox\u2019s net loss, in particular, saw no meaningful improvements from the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\nRBLX shares are down more than 13% year-to-date, and without significant reductions to Roblox\u2019s net losses, shares are unlikely to make a strong rebound.\n\nFastly (FSLY) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Fastly (FSLY) website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastly (NYSE:FSLY) is an edge cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS) technology, empowering developers to create and deliver digital experiences. Edge cloud computing refers to a technique for distributing data closer to the original source of that data or near the edge of a data network. Because edge devices process and prepare data locally, there are fewer bandwidth and latency issues. The New York Times, for example, uses Fastly to handle the high traffic volumes that come with breaking news and major events. Because Fastly is an important enabler of streaming services, the company will surely play a role in creating the metaverse. That is to say, as metaverse content proliferates, demand for quick content delivery mechanisms will also be high.\n\nUnfortunately, the company has suffered from slowing earnings and revenue growth in recent fiscal quarters. An ongoing class action lawsuit, which alleged Fastly misled investors on its financial guidance, tanked the edge platform\u2019s share price. FSLY shares have plummeted 58% since the start of 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The world of gaming has never been so full of opportunity and uncertainty. For an industry that\u2019s expected to grow to a market value of $312 billion by 2027, many of its biggest players are still divided over how this growth will manifest itself.\n\nAlthough Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) 2022 acquisition of leading gaming firm Activision Blizzard was in part a metaverse play, the furor surrounding the metaverse has since calmed significantly. Despite this, we\u2019re seeing use cases for Web 3.0 gaming and the incorporation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies as a means of broadening the horizons of what video games can achieve for their players.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re also seeing plenty of barriers to the growth of gaming stocks. Growing competition has stunted the growth of some stocks, while uncertainty over the appropriate incorporation of generative AI has prompted a backlash among consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn a market that\u2019s so full of opportunities, there\u2019s still plenty of danger for the sustainability of the landscape\u2019s strongest stocks. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three gaming stocks that could be a screaming sell in a tumultuous industry:\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn an industry full of unconventional stocks, it\u2019s some achievement that GameStop (NYSE:GME) is perhaps the most famous gaming stock on Wall Street today.\n\nHowever, GameStop\u2019s popularity has virtually nothing to do with the video game retail company itself, and therein lies the problem for the future of the stock.\n\nGameStop has consistently been the focal point of meme stock rallies, ever since the globally renowned retail investing influencer Keith Gill, otherwise known as Roaring Kitty, decided to cheerlead for GME in the buildup to its 4,000% short squeeze in January 2021.\n\nWhile the stock has since consistently slid from its astronomical peak, Gill recently returned from a social media hiatus to inspire more retail investors to buy back into GME.\n\nAlthough GameStop\u2019s most passionate retail investors fiercely promote the \u2018diamond hands\u2019 mentality, it can be extremely difficult for individuals to hold their positions in stock without any fresh positive news to drive further outperformance. With this in mind, it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that GME is destined to slide from its Q2 2024 highs over the rest of the year.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) There Doesn't Appear to Be a Clear Path Forward for EA Stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving spent almost 20 years as the uncontested market leader in soccer video game titles for consoles, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) appears set to face a brand new level of competition that could threaten the bottom line of the company at a challenging time for its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, EA\u2019s partnership with soccer governing body FIFA ended, prompting a reversion from its hugely successful FIFA series to EA Sports FC.\n\nWhile the game itself was largely unchanged in terms of content, the firm expected slower sales and Electronic Arts\u2019 Q1 2024 revenues of $1.78 billion saw a 5.1% year-on-year decline in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nWorryingly, EA\u2019s former naming rights partner, FIFA, recently announced that it would be reviving the FIFA title with rival gaming studio 2K Sports.\n\nReports suggest that a rival soccer title could arrive as soon as this year, posing a fresh threat to EA\u2019s market dominance.\n\nFor Electronic Arts, facing a challenge to its dominance in the soccer market is a significant danger. In March 2021, during the peak of EA\u2019s partnership with FIFA, the game\u2019s Ultimate Team mode amassed $1.62 billion in extra content revenue alone from in-game purchases.\n\nShould 2K Sports eat into EA\u2019s market share, we\u2019re likely to see the Vancouver-based studio suffer in terms of its bottom line.\n\nHasbro (HAS) Hasbro (HAS stock) letters standing next to Magic the Gathering trading cards (a game from Hasbro)\n\nSource: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we get to look at a stock that could be set to struggle as a result of unease over the generative AI boom. Although Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) isn\u2019t directly implicated in the ongoing GenAI content storm, its subsidiary, Wizards of The Coast has struggled with repeated backlashes over its behavior.\n\nIn January 2024, Wizards of The Coast was caught using generative AI art to advertise its Magic: The Gathering trading card game only a matter of weeks after the company pledged to use human artists rather than artificial intelligence within its operations.\n\nAfter initially denying the use of AI, Wizards of The Coast ultimately admitted that the image was created with \u201csome AI components.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Wizards of The Coast began advertising for an AI engineer, prompting further scrutiny among consumers.\n\nDespite fears over falling sales, Hasbro outperformed its expectations in Q1 2024 earnings. However, commentators have suggested that the stronger-than-expected quarter has been down to the performance of gaming titles like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 and a crossover between Fallout and Magic: The Gathering. Should the stock face further scrutiny in the future, it may find less support.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Explosive Growth Stocks Primed for Life-Changing Returns",
        "content": "Investing in the right stocks can lead to life-changing returns, especially if you have a lengthy time horizon. Compounding does its magic when you don\u2019t touch your investment for many years. If you get an 8% return on your $10,000 investment, it becomes $10,800 at the end of the year.\n\nHowever, an investor who gets an annualized 8% return over the next 30 years will turn their $10,000 into $100,626.57. That also includes the investor isn\u2019t making any additional contributions to their portfolio. That\u2019s why Charlie Munger said the first $100,000 is the hardest. Once you reach that level, it becomes easier to make the next $100,000 because of compounding.\n\nSome growth stocks grow at a faster rate than 8% per year. It\u2019s possible to find stocks maintaining annualized double-digit growth rates for over a decade. Investors looking for promising long-term opportunities may consider these enticing growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been delivering explosive returns for several years. The stock is up by 34% year-to-date and has tripled over the past five years. Online advertising continues to attract millions of businesses and generate more revenue for Alphabet.\n\nThe advertising segment was a major reason the company reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Net income growth outpaced revenue growth, which resulted in a 29.4% net profit margin. Alphabet is trimming its workforce while delivering higher revenue growth.\n\nGoogle Cloud is growing faster than the company\u2019s advertising services. As AI tailwinds manifest themselves, the company\u2019s cloud platform should experience elevated growth in the upcoming quarters.\n\nWall Street believes that AI tailwinds and other factors will result in solutions for long-term investors. Alphabet is rated as a Strong Buy with a projected 7% upside. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests that Alphabet can gain an additional 21%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also delivered impressive long-term returns for investors. The stock is up 24% year-to-date and has gained 236% over the past five years. The tech giant also offers a 0.65% yield and has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has numerous business segments, Microsoft Cloud is the most important one. Cloud revenue reached $35.1 billion in Q3 FY 24, 23% higher than last year\u2019s revenue. That\u2019s more than half of the company\u2019s $61.9 billion in revenue for the quarter. Overall revenue increased by 17 years over year, while net income was up by 20 years over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also has exposure to social media, gaming, advertising, business software and other verticals. Copilot makes it easier for the company to expand into additional industries and gain market share in its existing verticals. Copilot for Security has helped Microsoft strengthen its presence in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) An image of the Caterpillar tractor brand logo.\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has been a construction leader for almost 100 years. The firm provides essential equipment that helps contractors and construction businesses fulfill projects.\u00a0The company\u00a0raised its dividend by 8% earlier this year\u00a0but\u00a0already offers a 1.72%\u00a0yield. It\u2019s rare to see a company with a high growth rate and\u00a0yield, but Caterpillar delivers.\n\nYou\u2019ll also\u00a0see plenty of growth in\u00a0the stock price.\u00a0The firm trades at a P/E of 15x and is up\u00a0by\u00a0142% over the past five years. Caterpillar reported 47% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0first quarter\u00a0and deployed $5.1 billion toward share repurchases and dividend distributions.\n\n16 Wall Street analysts rate Caterpillar stock as a moderate buy. The average price target suggests a 13% upside from current levels. Some analysts are even more bullish. The highest price target of $440 per share indicates that Caterpillar can rally by an additional 34%.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that generates $354.2 million in annual recurring revenue. This Q1 figure represents a 21% year-over-year improvement. A yearly recurring revenue model makes it easier for Semrush to scale its finances over time. The company can increase its revenue by attracting more customers, raising prices and incentivizing existing customers to upgrade their accounts. Semrush has been able to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe continue to succeed in executing on our core growth pillars by onboarding more customers, cross-selling and up-selling to existing customers and leveraging AI in our platform to ensure businesses of any size have the most valuable digital marketing software suite,\u201d Semrush CEO and co-founder Oleg Shchegolev explained in the Q1 press release.\n\nSemrush closed the first quarter with nearly 112,000 paying customers, which is a 10% year-over-year improvement. The company also generated $2.1 million in net income and offered encouraging guidance. These signs point to a growth stock that can deliver long-term gains.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been in the rumor mill for several months. Tech giants are looking at the company as an acquisition target, which can lead to a big payday for investors. The speculation has helped this year, as the stock is only up 8% year-to-date. However, shares have more than tripled over the past five years, giving a better idea of what can happen when momentum accumulates.\n\nThe customer relationship management software continues to deliver impressive results. Revenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the first quarter to $617.4 million. Net income came to $5.9 million, compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same quarter last year. HubSpot also has a healthy balance sheet, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments.\n\nHubSpot\u2019s customer base grew by 22% year over year to reach 216,840 customers. That\u2019s plenty of recurring revenue for the company, and the average customer has an annual subscription of $11,447. It\u2019s no wonder big tech is circling HubSpot.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle Mexican fast food chain restaurant at night. CMG stock\n\nSource: Hrach Hovhannisyan / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been cooking up tasty returns for several years. The stock is up by 39% year-to-date and has more than quadrupled over the past five years. Shares are fresh from a stock split and have attracted plenty of Wall Street bulls. Chipotle is currently rated as a Moderate Buy with a projected 7% upside. The highest price target of $80 per share suggests that Chipotle can gain an additional 29% from current levels.\n\nRecent financial results warrant optimism. In the first quarter, Chipotle reported 14.1% year-over-year revenue growth, while diluted earnings per share increased by 23.9% year-over-year. Chipotle closed out the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nThe fast-food restaurant chain remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Chipotle opened an additional 47 restaurants in the first quarter, 43 of which were Chipotlanes. Chipotle has delivered impressive financials while raising prices and demanding strong customer loyalty.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) offers a suite of financial products and innovates in the industry. Some of the company\u2019s Gold perks are hard to beat, such as a credit card with unlimited 3% cashback, a 1% boost on all qualifying deposits and 3% contribution matches for IRAs.\n\nThe brokerage firm has been a rough hold for several years, but the stock has flipped the script. Shares have surged by an astonishing 81% year-to-date as the company delivers high profits. Robinhood reported 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter, generating $157 million in net income. Q1 profits represent a significant improvement as the company reported a net loss of $511 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nRobinhood has many opportunities to expand its revenue in future quarters. Investing activity, retirement accounts, credit cards and margins are some of Robinhood\u2019s opportunities that can reward long-term investors.

        "title": "Big Tech's Next Milestone Is The $4 Trillion Market Cap",
        "content": "Big Tech's Next Milestone Is The $4 Trillion Market Cap\n\nBig Tech is racing towards a milestone that would have seems impossible only a few decades ago, a market capitalization of $4 trillion.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) are members of the $3 trillion market cap club, with Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) having only surpassed the $2 trillion milestone.\n\nNvidia could win the $4 trillion race.\n\nWith even more powerful chips on the way, the AI boom could be that powerful to drive Nvidia to $4 trillion valuation. For a moment, Nvidia even became the world\u2019s most valuable company on June 18th. But, Nvidia got dethroned quickly due to concerns over the sustainability of its skyrocketing growth. On the other hand, Microsoft and Apple are ahead in terms of market size. Looking at past numbers, Apple was the first the reach the first three of the trillion valuation milestones. Both Apple and Microsoft are as strong as ever, but Nvidia has an incredible momentum on its side. But, just because it enjoys dominating the market does not mean it should not take seriously the threat of AMD or Intel catching up at some point, although Nvidia does have the resources to defend itself and continue to innovate. Perhaps Nvidia\u2019s biggest protection lies in its expansion of revenue sources as it aims to go beyond chips and build an entire AI ecosystem, ensuring it remains in the center of things as opposed to being only one link in the chain.\n\nNvidia\u2019s Promise Of Blackwell\n\nAt the end of June, Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang spoke at the company\u2019s annual general meeting and pitched the upcoming Blackwell chips as not only the most successful product in Nvidia\u2019s history but also in the entire computer history. Huan proudly spoke of reinventing Nvidia, the computer industry, and consequently, the world. The good part is that at the absolute end, Nvidia still does not have a big rival. But only time will show if the AI hype is enough to propel Nvidia to new heights, refuting doubts of concerned investors.\n\nPutting the the economic promise of AI and the fourth Industrial Revolution aside, there is a lot that is still unknown, the market dynamic is shaped with a lot of uncertainty that is out of even Big Tech\u2019s control, all of which would undoubtedly impact their path to a $4 trillion valuation. In addition, there\u2019s the long-term tech battle to think about in a new AI-shaped era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "\u2018There\u2019s More Upside Ahead\u2019: Daniel Ives Suggests 2 Tech Giants to Buy for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "Since the industrial revolution of the late 1700s, technology has informed and led a series of radical changes in our societies and economies. The pace has picked up speed in recent decades, as the world turned digital, and now AI is powering a so-called fourth industrial revolution, based on a rapid exchange of data and information.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, tech stocks have led the way in market gains. The tech-heavy NASDAQ rose an impressive 43% last year, and the S&P 500 rose 24%. Both indexes are continuing to post strong numbers this year; for 2024 year-to-date, they are up 24% and 17% respectively.\n\nThis has Wedbush analyst and tech expert Daniel Ives bullish on tech stocks, noting: \u201cThe first half of 2024 has been a very strong run for tech stocks led by Big Tech stalwarts Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta as this 4th Industrial Revolution has just begun to play out in our view in this 1995 Moment (not 1999) with many bears still yelling from their hibernation caves\u2026 We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we\u2019ve opened the TipRanks database to look up two of Ives\u2019 stock picks \u2013 well-known tech giants \u2013 and see how his takes stack up against the Wall Street consensus. Here are the details.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nFirst on our list, Microsoft has been leading the field in PCs and operating systems since the 1970s, and has become one of the world\u2019s most iconic brand names. In recent years, the company, based in Redmond, Washington, has continued its long commitment to advancing technology, by staking out a strong position at the leading edge of the artificial intelligence field. Microsoft has a long-standing interest in AI, and was an early backer of OpenAI, the company that brought us generative AI and Chat GPT at the end of 2022. The company\u2019s cumulative investments in OpenAI are in the neighborhood of $10 billion.\n\nFrom the user perspective, Microsoft has several highly visible AI initiatives. These include the integration of generative AI tech into the Bing search engine, in effort to make Bing more user friendly, with an improved interface and search results, aiming at a stronger competition with Google. Also, Microsoft is incorporating AI into the updates for the Windows and Office software packages. Prominent among these additions to the iconic software products is the Copilot, Microsoft\u2019s new AI-powered online assistant. The Copilot is designed to provide real-time user assistance, informed by the user\u2019s own work and content creation histories.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps the largest-scale use of AI in Microsoft\u2019s product delivery can be found in its cloud computing platform, the Azure subscription service. Azure is a package of cloud-based apps and tools, more than 200 all told, and Microsoft is incorporating AI into the platform \u2013 customers will be able to choose AI-enhanced versions of the Azure apps. The move promises to both make Azure a more user-friendly product, with greater flexibility, and to make the platform a stronger competitor to Amazon\u2019s AWS and to Google Cloud.\n\nA look at Microsoft\u2019s last financial report, which covered fiscal 3Q24, shows that the AI upgrade to Azure is bearing fruit. Azure is part of Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which generated $26.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 43% of the quarterly top line. The company\u2019s total revenue for fiscal Q3 was up 17% year-over-year, and reached $61.9 billion, beating the forecast by $1.01 billion. At the bottom line, Microsoft saw earnings of $2.94 per share, a figure that was 11 cents per share better than had been expected \u2013 and was up 20% from the prior-year period.\n\nShares in Microsoft have shown strong performance over the past year; unsurprising given the solid financial results. The stock has gained 42% in the last 12 months, and is up almost 25% so far this year.\n\nFor Ives, the key point here is the potential of AI to unlock additional gains as MSFT goes forward. He writes, \u201cWe believe the stock still has yet to price in what we view as the next wave of cloud and AI growth coming to the Redmond story with a strong competitive cloud edge vs. Amazon especially and Google in cloud bake offs. Our recent partner checks have been incrementally strong around Copilot deployments with MSFT customers and ultimately we estimate this could add another ~$25 billion to Redmond\u2019s topline trajectory by FY25. Here is the key as the multiplier ripple impact from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia is just starting to be felt on the cloud/software layer as the 2nd derivatives of the AI Revolution play out in the field.\u201d\n\nThe tech expert goes on to give Microsoft shares an Outperform (Buy) rating, along with a price target of $550, suggesting a one-year upside potential of 18%. (To watch Ives\u2019 track record, click here)\n\nThis venerable tech firm has picked up 33 recent analyst reviews, with a lopsided split of 32 Buys to 1 Hold giving the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is priced at $464.98, and its $500.55 average price target implies it will gain 7.5% in the coming year. (See MSFT stock forecast)\n\nSalesforce.com (CRM)\n\nNext up is Salesforce, a well-known name in the field of customer relationship management, or CRM. Salesforce gives a good definition of CRM, describing it as a system for managing company interactions with all customers, current and potential, with the simple goal of improving relationships and expanding the business.\n\nSalesforce has been in the CRM business since 1999, and has perfected the system. The company offers an industry-leading, cloud-based software platform that streamlines CRM activities, including sales calls, marketing emails, and customer service interactions. The platform tracks these interactions and builds up a unified database comprised of customer and company information.\n\nIn recent years, Salesforce has integrated AI technology into its CRM software products, further enhancing the abilities of both developers and users to customize the platform, fitting it to any scale or business purpose. The company\u2019s AI integration streamlines data retrieval, improves communications, automates repetitive tasks, and generates actionable insights through autonomous data analysis. Salesforce is also making use of generative AI for automated creative purposes \u2013 generating personalized customer communications, including targeting marketing contacts and determining the best timing for their release.\n\nSalesforce has, in its years of operation, made itself an essential part of the business universe, offering a necessary service, based on the latest technology, and delivering solid results for its customers.\n\nAs for Salesforce\u2019s results, the company reported its fiscal 1Q25 financial release at the end of May and beat the forecast on earnings while missing on revenue. The company\u2019s revenue came to $9.13 billion, up almost 11% from the prior year but $20 million less than had been expected. The bottom line was reported as $2.44 by non-GAAP measures, for a 44% y/y increase \u2013 and beating the estimates by 7 cents per share.\n\nThe company reported some additional metrics that should pique investor interest, including $8.59 billion in subscription & support revenue, up 12% year-over-year and a main driver of the overall revenue growth. Free cash flow was up in the quarter, by 43% y/y, to reach $6.08 billion. Salesforce finished the quarter with $9.96 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand, as of April 30 this year.\n\nWhile these results were sound, shares in Salesforce dropped sharply after the release \u2013 mainly when the Q2 forecast failed to impress. Company estimates for both revenue and earnings in Q2 came in below the consensus estimates. Currently, the stock is flat for the year-to-date.\n\nDan Ives, in his coverage of Salesforce, takes an investor\u2019s perspective \u2013 and he\u2019s impressed by the company\u2019s current capabilities and near-term potential. Ives writes of Salesforce, \u201cIn our view, CRM is on the path to a higher growth, margin, and FCF trajectory and this is just a small bump in the road during a transitionary growth period\u2026 CRM [remains] one of our favorite tech names to own over the next year as the AI story starts to take shape. We would be buyers on weakness\u2026 as seeing the forest through the trees this is a turnaround in motion for a premier tech stalwart with a massive installed base led by one of the best CEOs in the global tech landscape in our view.\u201d\n\nTaking these comments forward, Ives rates CRM as Outperform (Buy), with a $315 price target that suggests a 21% gain in the months ahead.\n\nThere are 40 recent analyst reviews on record for Salesforce shares and they break down to 29 Buys, 10 Holds, and 1 Sell, giving the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $259.81, with a $297.11 average target price that indicates potential for a 14% upside on the one-year horizon.

        "title": "Valero and DR Horton Are on the Casualty List",
        "content": "Get em while they're cold.\n\nThat's the idea behind my Casualty List, a quarterly compendium of stocks that have recently been knocked down, and that I believe will rise again.\n\nYou'd never guess it from watching the market averages, but about half of all U.S. stocks were down in the past three months. That gives me ample fodder for the Casualty List.\n\nValero\n\nLeading off my second-quarter list is Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO), a large oil refiner whose stock fell about 8% in April through June.\n\nThe rise of electric cars is denting gasoline demand, and warm winters are reducing the need for heating oil. In addition, refineries in Asia and Latin America are providing more competition for American ones.\n\nI feel that the refiners have been punished too harshly. Valero, for example, still has a 5% after-tax profit margin, and scored a 27% return on stockholders' equity in the past four quarters. Yet the stock sells for less than eight times recent earnings. (The median ratio is about 24.)\n\nAnalysts think earnings will fall this year, and in 2025 and 2026 too. My hunch is that they are too pessimistic.\n\nD.R. Horton\n\nMortgage rates are a monkey wrench in the gears of the homebuilding industry. Lately, it costs close to 7% to finance a home. That's the most in about 20 years, though considerably less than the rates in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nNew home sales this spring were only a little above 600,000 per month. In homebuilding's heyday (October 2002 to May 2006) they were over a million a month. I believe that there is big pent-up demand for houses, and that a boom for homebuilders is likely in 2025 if mortgage rates come down a peg or two.\n\nD.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the nation's largest homebuilder, selling houses at a variety of price points in 33 states. The stock, down 14% in the second quarter, goes for nine times earnings.\n\nMetallus\n\nMetallus Inc. (NYSE:MTUS), of Canton, Ohio, makes steel and precision steel components. Its profitability is only so-so, but I like its balance sheet. Debt is a mere 3% of stockholders' equity, and the company has almost $12 of cash for every dollar of debt.\n\nThis small stock ($858 million market value) is almost totally neglected by Wall Street. Only three analysts follow it, all from small firms. The stock, down 9% in the second quarter, fetches about 12 times earnings.\n\nBall\n\nBall Corp. (NYSE:BALL), based in Westminster, Colorado, is the world's larger maker of metal cans. It has been consistently profitable and has increased its earnings by an average of about 6% a year over the past decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not much compared to the big technology stocks that have captured investors' hearts and money in recent year. But Ball's net profit margin is 31%, in the same league as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 36% and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 26%. After dropping 11% in the second quarter, Ball trades for 5 times earnings.\n\nWalgreens Boots\n\nTroubles abound at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and its stock fell a sickening 43% in the second quarter. The company plans to close up to 25% of its 8,600 stores, and has considered separating the Walgreens chain in America from the Boots chain in Great Britain.\n\nYet for all its woes, Walgreens still earned $3.98 a share in 2023, and analysts predict that earnings will stay north of $3 a share through 2026. Given those estimates, the stock looks to me like a steal at the recent price of $11.26.\n\nThe record\n\nI've been compiling the Casualty list since 2000, and have one-year results for 81 lists. The average one-year return has been 14.69%, versus 11.00% for the Standard and Poor's 500 Total Return Index.\n\nOf the 81 lists, 51 were profitable and 39 beat the index.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nMy list from a year ago advanced 24.08%, not quite enough to beat the S&P's total return, which was 26.16%. My best pick from July 2023 was Acuity Brands Inc. (NYSE:AYI), up 49%. My worst was Columbia Sportswear Co. (NASDAQ:COLM), up less than 1%.\n\nI had a modest gain on Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:OXY) and a 39% gain in Valero, which now finds itself on the Casualty List again.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, Massachusetts.

        "title": "Qualcomm, Microsoft Lean on AI Hype to Spur PC Market Revival",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tech companies from Microsoft Corp. to Qualcomm Inc. are embarking on a marketing blitz for a new type of computer they are dubbing \u201cAI PCs,\u201d promising artificial intelligence features embedded in their laptops and desktops.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMicrosoft Orders China Staff to Use iPhones for Work and Drop Android Boeing to Plead Guilty to Fraud for Violating Deal Over 737 Max Crashes Biden Narrows Gap With Trump in Swing States Despite Debate Loss Hedge Funds That Piled Into Big Tesla Short Stung by Rally Old School FX Traders Are Being Replaced By Algos With Names Like Viper\n\nThe new laptops differ from standard devices with the inclusion of an additional processor that\u2019s tailored to speed up AI features like personal assistants and the ability to automate tasks.\n\nBut only 3% of PCs shipped this year will meet Microsoft\u2019s processing power threshold to be considered an AI PC, according to industry research firm IDC. To persuade consumers and corporations that it\u2019s time to buy, the industry will need to offer a wider variety of the PCs and deliver software that takes advantage of the new hardware.\n\nSo far, analysts and reviewers also are taking a skeptical tone toward the new laptops\u2019 artificial intelligence abilities. Usefulness is limited because few software makers beyond Microsoft are building features to utilize the new chips in the machines optimized for AI tasks, said Eric Compton, a financial analyst focused on the PC industry at Morningstar.\n\nApplication makers like Adobe Inc., Salesforce Inc. and SentinelOne Inc. rebuffed one of the largest PC makers when it asked them to tweak software so AI tools could be used directly on the new computers in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the discussions. All of those companies deliver AI features through the cloud.\n\nSentinelOne is looking at optimizing its products for AI PCs in future development, but it will likely take years for these devices to reach a \u201csufficient proportion of deployed machines,\u201d Gregor Stewart, the company\u2019s vice president of AI, said in a statement. Clara Shih, who leads Salesforce\u2019s AI efforts, said the company is developing on-device language models, the technology that underpins many types of generative AI, but didn\u2019t provide any expected timeline for release.\n\nSome smaller software makers optimized their apps for on-device AI. That includes Blackmagic Design Inc., which makes video-editing software that competes with Adobe\u2019s Premiere, and Algoriddim\u2019s music-mixing tool djay.\n\nFor now, available AI features are largely gimmicks, said a Best Buy Co. employee shortly after launch in June, who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions. Machines known as \u201cCopilot+ PCs\u201d are limited to features like a tool that makes it appear you are looking at the camera during a video meeting when in reality your eyes are focused elsewhere. Generative AI models can be used to produce images on the device, but still require internet connection for content moderation. A flagship Microsoft feature that would let a user easily find past activity on their computer, called Recall, was delayed due to privacy concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson said developers have \u201cshown great enthusiasm\u201d in building apps to use the new hardware and user feedback for the new devices has been \u201cterrific.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high for many of the companies involved. Qualcomm, the provider of the new chips, says it\u2019s ready to challenge Intel Corp.\u2019s dominance in the machines. PC makers like Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. hope the machines will fuel consumer excitement for personal computers again. But the companies will need to ensure performance matches the marketing to avoid previous dead ends \u2013 like Windows short-lived mobile operating system or detachable screens.\n\nAn HP spokesperson said the company is working with software vendors to build new experiences for the AI PC while touting existing features like real-time translation.\n\nEven if features are currently limited, AI PCs have the potential to fuel a wave of new higher-priced purchases. Many consumers, businesses and schools bought laptops in the early months of the pandemic, but haven\u2019t yet upgraded. New AI capabilities will help steer buyers toward higher-end options, Michael Dell, founder and chief executive officer of the namesake company, said in a May interview. \u201cDo you want to buy a PC that is not capable of doing those AI things that you\u2019ll want to do in the future? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nThere are early signs of traction. A fifth of computers sold during launch week were AI PCs, according to data provided by market researcher Circana. Tech-savvy consumers like content creators have been quicker to adopt the new machines, while the general public is likely still a bit \u201cconfused,\u201d said Mike Crosby, executive director at Circana.\n\nThe other major selling point is better battery life than other laptops that use Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating systems. Qualcomm claims its more-efficient chips based on Arm Holdings Plc designs can mean days of use without charging. Avi Greengart, an industry analyst at Techsponential who helped host a Qualcomm promotional event, said in an interview that battery life rather than AI is the main selling point of the laptops at this point.\n\nBut the different chips also raise the potential for compatibility issues with generations of software written for Intel or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. processors. Common apps like Microsoft Office, Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp and Adobe\u2019s Photoshop have been optimized for the Arm-based systems. But many legacy applications still used within businesses will not be supported, likely capping adoption among enterprises, said Erik Woodring, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nQualcomm acknowledges it has to step up efforts to promote its brand and help PC makers with advertising. That\u2019s necessary because the industry has relied on Intel for promotional dollars for decades under arguably the most successful component campaign ever: \u201cIntel Inside.\u201d Consumers in particular have been trained to see that label on their computers as a sign of quality. And Intel has even managed to bring sub brands to the forefront. Its Centrino push in 2003 led to an explosion in notebook use with the inclusion of Wi-Fi connections.\n\nQualcomm, which has tried and failed previously to grab a piece of the PC market, is spending more than $75 million per year to print the name of its Snapdragon processor on the jerseys of Manchester United Football Club players. It has also upped its payments to partners like PC makers to help support marketing, said Chief Marketing Officer Don McGuire.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment, but this has to be a sustained thing,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the next six years, not the the next six months.\u201d\n\nAverage starting prices for the new slate of Qualcomm-based AI PCs are about 48% more expensive than their non-AI counterparts, wrote Samik Chatterjee, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He sees Qualcomm owning about 25% of the AI PC market by 2026.\n\nLater this year, Intel and AMD are expected to release their own AI PCs, which are likely to have fewer of the compatibility issues associated with Arm-based devices.\n\nStill, it\u2019ll be a long road to get consumer and business adoption. In 2026, AI PCs will still only make up about 20% of new PC shipments, according to IDC.\n\n--With assistance from Jaewon Kang, Matt Day and Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing The Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded A World-First Psychedelics Experiment Is Unfolding in Australia Dragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum",
        "content": "Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL), a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing solutions, was founded in 1977. The company excels in developing and marketing database software and technology, cloud-engineered systems and enterprise software products, particularly its own brands of database management systems.\n\nOriginally an enterprise software database giant, Oracle has transitioned to the cloud over the past 10 to 15 years and is now poised to tackle the artificial intelligence revolution. As such, the company presents a compelling investment opportunity amid its impressive momentum in AI and cloud businesses.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\n\nDespite tight competition, Oracle has delivered high double-digit growth in both areas recently. As a legacy database provider, its database solutions have become a key competitive advantage against industry peers, strengthening its position in the cloud business. Oracle offers a comprehensive and fast cloud solution for deploying AI, boasting the fastest infrastructure in the industry, backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hardware. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle Investor Relations\n\nOracle reported its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on June 11. Quarterly earnings of $1.63 per share narrowly missed estimates by 1.20%. Revenue of $14.29 billion also missed expectations by 1.90%. Despite these misses, the stock price surged due to growth in the remaining performance obligation, which has remained resilient despite the deceleration in the company's cloud infrastructure growth rate.\n\nSignificant deals with Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) around Oracle Cloud Infrastructure also contributed to this positive sentiment. Oracle's earnings growth was complemented by strong margins, with the adjusted operating margin and adjusted Ebitda margin expanding to 44% and 55%, respectively, highlighting the scalability of OCI across its operations. I believe Oracle can sustain this exceptional growth rate as it continues to build larger data centers. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nYear to date, Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 20%, with the stock yielding more than 35% compared to the S&P 500's 17% increase.\n\nThe company's expanded partnership with Microsoft and other cloud computing providers is expected to enhance the expansion and reach of its leading database management services. Given its smaller scale compared to Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, Oracle must capitalize on multi-cloud adoption opportunities to justify its premium valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic moves\n\nOracle's transformation is certainly pushing the boundaries of what the company can achieve, with the primary growth constraint being the speed at which it can establish new data centers. Despite missing both top and bottom-line estimates in the fourth quarter, the stock surged over 13% post-earnings release.\n\nThis surge was driven by the impressive growth in Oracle's RPO, which grew 44% year over year to an astounding $98 billion and increased by $18 billion from the third quarter. Management expects 39% of this amount, or about $38.20 billion, to materialize in the next 12 months. The significant contracts signed in the third and fourth quarter, driven by the unrelenting AI demand, marked the largest sales quarters in Oracle's history. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nThroughout the year, the company secured pivotal deals with industry giants OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. These contracts are crucial as they involve leading names in the AI space that are poised to dominate in the coming years. OpenAI, the entity behind the AI revolution with ChatGPT, signed on to run deep learning and AI workloads on the Oracle OCI. Oracle reported that a total of 30 AI contracts were signed in the fourth quarter, valued at over $12 billion. For these projects, the company will utilize cutting-edge Nvidia chips, interconnect network solutions and liquid cooling to train neural networks. Management also announced the construction of four large data centers for this initiative, potentially incorporating Nvidia's new Blackwell GPUs.\n\nAdditionally, Oracle entered a partnership with Google to offer OCI database services through Google Cloud, planning to build 12 OCI data centers within Google Cloud. The company also advanced its collaboration with Microsoft, with 11 of the planned 23 OCI data centers within Microsoft Azure already operational. During the earnings call, there were hints of a potential future partnership with Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. With the global shift towards multi-cloud adoption, a deal with AWS would not be surprising. These strategic moves demonstrate Oracle's strong positioning to capitalize on the AI boom through its data centers.\n\nFlexibility and scalability in cloud services\n\nOracle is also offering private OCI for enterprises looking to leverage its cloud services within their own data centers. As outlined in the earnings call, customers will not pay for hardware, but only for consumption costs, with the ability to scale services as needed for training large language models and neural networks. This flexibility is expected to drive scalable revenue generation for Oracle. Its multi-cloud integration and adaptable cloud services position it as a versatile and comprehensive solution for various enterprise needs.\n\nFurther, its Gen2 AI Cloud Infrastructure currently faces demand that far exceeds supply. The company's legacy as a database provider gives it a competitive edge, allowing it to leverage its position in the cloud business. Oracle's capital expenditure guidance for 2024, ranging between $7 billion and $7.50 billion, reflects the increasing demand for Oracle Cloud. This includes growing demand in national security and European Union sovereign regions. While Oracle's infrastructure as a service is in growth mode, its profitable legacy platform supports its overall profitability, enabling competitive pricing for its cloud offerings. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith only a 2% market share in the cloud market, Oracle has substantial room to grow and capture share from competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the top three players in the field. Recent quarters have seen the company growing its cloud revenue at a faster pace than its main competitors, indicating a strong growth trajectory.\n\nBusiness performance and outlook\n\nDespite the quarterly earnings misses, Oracle's standout performer was the cloud infrastructure segment, which saw revenue jump 42% year over year. The Cloud Application segment also registered growth, reaching $3.30 billion, a 10% increase. Non-GAAP operating margins showed significant strength, increasing 47%.\n\nFor the full year, Oracle reported total revenue of $53 billion, a 6% increase, with non-GAAP operating margins at 44%. It generated $5.56 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nSource: Oracle's Investor Relations\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, I anticipate exceptional top-line growth as Oracle continues to build out regional AI factories and expand embedded OCI services in Azure data centers. The company has carved out a niche with its automated OCI services, which are poised to grow as quickly as data centers can be constructed. Management projects strong sequential growth for the year as OCI capacity scales to meet demand, with cloud infrastructure services expected to increase 50%. They also reiterated their fiscal 2026 revenue goal of $65 billion, though they now believe this target may be conservative given the accelerated growth momentum seen in 2024. This target seems achievable given the rapid growth across OCI infrastructure and services.\n\nMargin analysis\n\nThere has been some tightening on the margin side due to significant investments to meet the surging demand for Oracle's second generation AI Cloud infrastructure. I expect margins to improve as the company works through its backlog of orders. As the top-line growth continues, I foresee margins scaling and expanding due to the company's automated, modular data center capacity. Additionally, given the recent data breach by one of Oracle's cloud database competitors, there may be opportunities to capture additional market share that were previously unavailable.\n\nCapital expenditures and free cash flow\n\nA key takeaway from the fourth-quarter earnings report was the management's update on capital expenditure spending. For the year, capital expenditures amounted to nearly $6.90 billion. During the earnings call, management stated they expect capex spending to double in fiscal 2025, reaching nearly $14 billion, significantly higher than the earlier prediction of $10 billion.\n\nWhile this figure is substantial, Oracle's cash flow statement shows it has become a free cash flow-generating machine. In 2024, Oracle generated $11.80 billion in free cash flow, a 39% growth. Although FCF growth slowed compared to 2023's 68%, the absolute magnitude of the cash flows should alleviate concerns about the company's capital expenditure.\n\nInvestors should keep an eye on capex spending, but Oracle's ability to generate significant free cash flows, combined with its focus on major AI players as customers, mitigates some of the concerns surrounding the high figure.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nOracle currently trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of about 22, aligning with some peers such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) (22.30) and Alphabet (22.10), but more attractively priced compared to others like Microsoft (33) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) (28.40).\n\nHistorically, Oracle has traded at lower multiples, but the recent surge in positive developments, particularly partnerships with AI giants like OpenAI, Alphabet and Microsoft, has justified a higher multiple. These strategic partnerships have significantly boosted the company's growth potential, particularly in the AI and cloud infrastructure space. Given the company's trajectory, I believe a forward earnings multiple of 22 is appropriate. The company has demonstrated robust earnings per share growth, recording an 8.60% increase, which is close to its fiscal 2026 target of over 10%.\n\nWith a forward PEG ratio of approximately 1.80 and considering management's earnings growth target of 10% by 2026, we can adjust our valuation assumptions accordingly. This adjustment yields an adjusted PEG ratio of around 2. If Oracle achieves this growth target in 2025, the projected EPS would be around $6, aligning closely with the analyst consensus of $6.30. Using a forward price-earnings ratio of 22, this would result in a price target of $135, roughly matching the current trading levels and implying a potential downside of about 5%.\n\nTo further validate the valuation derived from the price-earnings multiple approach, a discounted cash flow analysis can be employed. Using a discount rate of 11% and aligning with management's 10% growth estimate through 2026, the DCF valuation also does not provide a sufficient margin of safety to recommend the stock at current levels. Oracle Is Navigating the AI Revolution With Cloud Momentum\n\nWhile Oracle's growth is commendable, particularly in cloud infrastructure and AI, it faces stiff competition from companies like Microsoft, whose Azure and intelligent cloud offerings are better positioned. Microsoft's superior growth in these areas highlights the competitive challenges the company must navigate. Given that Oracle's stock has already surged over 15% following its impressive earnings release and is up over 35% year to date, the current valuation reflects much of the positive developments.\n\nGiven the little to no upside potential at the current price levels, I am maintaining my hold rating on Oracle. The stock has already incorporated significant gains, and while its partnerships and growth in AI and cloud infrastructure are promising, the current valuation does not present a compelling entry point for new investors.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nOracle stands at the forefront of the AI and cloud computing revolution, leveraging its legacy as a database provider to drive growth in these burgeoning sectors. The company's strategic partnerships with key players in the AI space, coupled with its robust financial performance and free cash flow generation, position it well for future expansion.\n\nHowever, given the current valuation levels, which already account for much of the anticipated growth, the stock appears fairly priced with limited immediate upside potential. Thus, while Oracle's long-term outlook remains strong, I advise investors to watch for more attractive entry points in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: AMD vs. Microsoft",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been on fire over the last year thanks to a rally in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The Nasdaq Composite index, which includes many of the world's leading tech companies, has popped 21% year to date (outperforming the S&P 500's 16% rise). The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 brought renewed interest in AI and illustrated its potential to boost countless industries.\n\nAs a result, the companies behind the hardware and software that makes AI possible have enjoyed significant stock gains. Two companies on Wall Street's radar are Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), with one a leader in chip design and the other delivering innovative ways to get AI into the hands of millions of consumers.\n\nThese companies could have bright futures in AI, a market projected to hit close to $2 trillion in spending by 2030. So, let's take a closer look at these tech giants and determine whether AMD or Microsoft is the better stock to invest in AI.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\nShares in AMD have spiked 153% since the start of 2023. The company has gone full force into AI, motivated by its rival Nvidia's immense success in the industry. Nvidia's earnings and stock price have hit record heights as its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to for developers worldwide.\n\nAMD has responded by launching competing chips and has made promising progress, attracting customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Meanwhile, the company is taking its cues from Nvidia, shifting to an annual chip release schedule rather than the two-year cycle it was previously on. So, after announcing its MI300X AI accelerator last year, the company followed that by unveiling its MI325X this June.\n\nHowever, AMD has its work cut out, with Nvidia responsible for between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market. These companies are by no means new competitors. AMD has played second fiddle to Nvidia in the desktop GPU market for at least the last decade. Since 2014, AMD's share of the sector has fallen from 35% to 12%, while Nvidia's has soared from 65% to 88%.\n\nAMD's performance in the desktop GPU market doesn't inspire much confidence yet in how it will do against Nvidia in AI. However, the rapid growth of the industry and soaring chip demand could play in AMD's favor, with room for Nvidia to retain its dominance and for AMD to find a lucrative role in meeting supply demands that its rival can't.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nWhile AMD faces the repercussions of a delayed start in AI, it's almost the opposite for Microsoft. The software king was an early investor in the industry, partnering with ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in the start-up over the years, making it OpenAI's biggest backer.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe partnership has made Microsoft a major threat in AI, allowing it to get a head start over competitors Amazon and Alphabet. Access to some of the most powerful AI models in the industry has enabled Microsoft to enhance multiple areas of its business. The company has integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its search engine, Bing, monetized new AI features on its Office productivity software, and brought generative tools to its cloud platform, Azure.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's AI efforts showed signs of paying off in its third quarter of 2024 (which ended in March). Revenue increased by 17% year over year to $62 billion, beating forecasts by more than $1 billion. AI appeared to boost multiple parts of its business, with revenue in its productivity and intelligent cloud segments increasing by 12% and 21%, respectively.\n\nMicrosoft's recent success saw it surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company this year. Yet, its dominance in tech and vast financial resources indicate it's nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\n\nIs AMD or Microsoft the better AI stock?\n\nAMD and Microsoft are at vastly different stages in their AI journeys, with one still figuring out where it stands among its competitors and the other enjoying success with increasingly established services.\n\nAs a result, the question of which of these companies is the better AI stock lies in their reliability. AMD's long-term position in AI is more uncertain than Microsoft's. Meanwhile, the chipmaker has significantly less cash reserves than the Windows company, which only creates more doubt about its future. MSFT PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows that AMD's stock offers significantly less value than Microsoft's, illustrated by its far higher price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow. AMD's earnings growth has yet to align with its share price, making it overvalued for now. Microsoft isn't exactly a bargain buy, but these valuation metrics show it's a more reasonably priced option.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's considerably higher free cash flow indicates it's better equipped to continue expanding in AI and keep up with its rivals.

        "content": "US technology giant Microsoft is showing a long-term commitment to providing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) services Hong Kong with educational initiatives as its investee OpenAI restricts access in the city and mainland China.\n\nIn its latest push into classrooms, Microsoft worked with the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School to provide AI services starting from last academic year that ended in June. About 220 pupils in grades 5 and 6 were given access to Microsoft's chatbot and text-to-image generation tools - powered by OpenAI's GPT and Dall-E models - in science classes.\n\nThe partnership comes after Microsoft reached deals with eight universities in Hong Kong last year to promote its AI services. The US tech giant's K-12 expansion comes through its global training partner Gamenoodlesoup, an education and entertainment technology developer. Anderson Yu, the founder of Gamenoodlesoup, said his firm has worked with the school since April 2023 to fit Microsoft Azure cloud services to the school's specific needs.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"I think our education offerings in Hong Kong definitely will continue,\" said Fred Sheu, national technology officer at Microsoft Hong Kong. Microsoft plans to \"roll out this solution to all the schools in Hong Kong. That's definitely our strategy and plan in the next few years.\"\n\nStudents Hoie Tong and Johnny Wong test a ship designed with the help of Microsoft's AI tools, and with guidance from their STEM teacher.

Photo: Kelly Le>\n\nMicrosoft has been heavily pushing its AI services in Asia and has maintained its commitment to Hong Kong even as rivals keep their distance amid US-China geopolitical tensions. OpenAI recently restricted access in the city to its application programming interface (API).\n\nSheu reiterated Microsoft's earlier guarantee to maintain its Azure AI services, which rely on OpenAI's models, saying the API restrictions have \"no impact\" on the tech giant. Microsoft has a 49 per cent stake in OpenAI's for-profit arm.\n\n\"All the universities ... our government-funded universities, already acquired this Azure OpenAI service, so they are qualified customers,\" Sheu said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's business in China has recently been the subject of political scrutiny back home. US lawmakers questioned Microsoft president Brad Smith last month about the firm's China operations. The executive said China accounts for just 1.5 per cent of its global revenue, and he confirmed the company is offering to relocate 700 to 800 employees to other markets.\n\nFor AI services specifically, Microsoft is left with the same challenge facing many other tech firms: proving the worth of GenAI in real-world applications.\n\nElsa Cheung Kam Yan, principal of the Jockey Club Primary School, said the use of AI can enhance the effectiveness of learning and teaching, as students will have \"widened exposure\" to information and more freedom to explore outside their textbooks.\n\nThe school, which has been working with Microsoft Hong Kong for 12 years, plans to expand the usage of AI to more classes, said vice-principal Philip Law Kam Yuen.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Better Megacap Stock: Nvidia vs. Microsoft",
        "content": "Let's face it: 2024 has been all about the megacaps. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is up 147% year to date; MetaPlatforms is up 44%; Alphabet is up 33%.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms now boast a combined market cap of $15.6 trillion. That's roughly equivalent to the size of the Eurozone economy, which has an annual gross domestic product of $15.4 billion, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank.\n\nSo, let's compare two of the best megacaps, Nvidia and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), to see which is better positioned to rule the second half of 2024 -- and beyond. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nNo company has experienced a more remarkable growth in its market cap over the past two years than Nvidia. The semiconductor giant has added a staggering $2.7 trillion in value, catapulting it to the position of the most valuable company on Earth, if only briefly.\n\nIts rise is almost entirely thanks to the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and the hardware behind it. Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs). These powerful devices are often linked together by the thousands -- even hundreds of thousands -- within data centers to help train the latest and greatest AI models.\n\nWhile there are other companies in the GPU design space, Nvidia enjoys several key competitive advantages. The trust and familiarity AI developers have with Nvidia's GPUs and its software make it challenging for them to switch to another supplier. Moreover, Nvidia's extensive experience in GPU design prior to the AI boom gives it a unique edge over its competitors.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite the attention garnered by Nvidia's rapid ascent, it's important not to overlook Microsoft's impressive stock performance. The company once again holds the title of the most valuable company on Earth, a position it regained after briefly being overtaken by Nvidia. To maintain this lead, Microsoft is demonstrating its adaptability to the evolving tech landscape, particularly the AI revolution.\n\nOn that front, Microsoft has already begun integrating AI into its signature software applications. It now offers a generative AI assistant through its Microsoft Copilot add-on, which can analyze data, respond to queries, create images, and generate code.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft diverse business segments provide a layer of protection, should the AI revolution falter. The company has a massive cloud services unit and a successful gaming division among various other business segments.\n\nWhich stock is a better buy in the second half of 2024?\n\nSimply put, both Nvidia and Microsoft are outstanding companies. They generate billions in revenue, profits, and free cash flow. They're also led by some of the top CEOs on the planet: Satya Nadella at Microsoft and Jensen Huang at Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there are differences to evaluate.\n\nFor one, Nvidia's valuation is approaching record highs. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now 39x -- more than double its 10-year average of 15x.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's P/S ratio is also historically high at 14x. However, that value is less than half of Nvidia's on an absolute basis. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nIn other words, both stocks are historically expensive, but Nvidia is far more costly in a head-to-head comparison.\n\nAt any rate, the rapid growth of the GPU market is what investors are counting on to bring Nvidia's valuation down. And while those growth estimates are impressive (analysts expect Nvidia's sales to rise 98% over last year), any signs of slowing growth could lead to a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares.\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer Microsoft, given the stock's more reasonable valuation at current levels. That said, long-term Nvidia investors shouldn't bail on the stock now. Rather, they should remember that one of the keys to successful buy-and-hold investing is to let winners run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Tech Stocks Heading for a Fall",
        "content": "When it comes to stocks, valuation matters.\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio measures a company\u2019s share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio helps to determine if a stock is expensive, or trading at a high multiple, relative to its peers or the overall market. Currently, the average P/E ratio among stocks listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index is near 25 times future earnings estimates.\n\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the average P/E ratio among U.S. stocks was closer to 17 times earnings. Stocks trading at extremely high multiples are often doing so because investors are banking on big future growth at the company, or because hype surrounding a stock is leading to a lot of people buying it. Value investors rigorously scrutinize valuations before buying a stock. Warren Buffett famously won\u2019t buy a stock that has a P/E ratio above 15.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three overvalued tech stocks heading for a fall. Don\u2019t slip up on them.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) looks pricey trading at 727 times future earnings estimates. In the last 12 months, CRWD stock has risen 167%, including a 57% year-to-date (YTD) gain. The sharp move higher has given CrowdStrike stock a lofty valuation. The high P/E multiple was one of the reasons the stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).\n\nPiper Sandler lowered its rating on CRWD stock to a hold equivalent neutral from an overweight buy equivalent rating previously. The analysts maintained their price target on the stock of $400. Also, Piper Sandler noted that CrowdStrike stock has few catalysts working in its favor currently. And, the risk/reward for the shares has become less favorable after the big move higher over the past year.\n\nDatadog (DDOG) The Datadog (DDOG) logo displayed on a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Karol Ciesluk / Shutterstock.com\n\nDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) looks woefully overpriced right now trading at 443 times future earnings approximations. The company, whose software is used in cloud-computing, has seen its share price rise only about 34% in the last 12 months. However, the move has still pushed shares of the company, which went public in 2019, up to extreme heights relative to its earnings outlook.\n\nInvestors are clearly betting on big future growth at Datadog, which builds cloud monitoring and security products that work with Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other cloud platforms. Analysts are less convinced and have also been downgrading this stock. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) lowered its rating on DDOG stock to neutral from buy, dropping its price target to $105 from $123.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong semiconductor stocks, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) looks pricey trading at 239 times future earnings estimates. AMD stock, which has risen 43% in the last 12 months, is more expensive than rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The latter\u2019s share price is up 203% over the last year but currently trades at a P/E ratio of 75. Some analysts speculate that the valuation is holding back AMD stock.\n\nSince hitting a 52-week high in March of this year, AMD stock has declined nearly 30%. Lackluster financial results are part of the reason. But so too is the premium at which the stock has been trading based largely on hype surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). In June, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) downgraded AMD stock to a hold equivalent equal weight rating from a buy equivalent overweight rating.

        "title": "Nvidia will win the race to a $4 trillion market cap\u2014but the long-term big tech battle might be different, experts say",
        "content": "A surprisingly resilient economy and profit-filled AI boom are driving the United States\u2019 big tech giants toward a milestone that would have seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple have all surpassed the $3 trillion market capitalization mark, and Google and Amazon are following close behind in the $2 trillion range.\n\nCombined, these five tech giants alone are now worth more than $14.5 trillion and make up roughly 32% of the S&P 500. For reference, in 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, the total market capitalization of every U.S. stock was $11.1 trillion, according to Siblis Research data. Big tech\u2019s performance has been particularly impressive this year, with Nvidia, for example, surging from a $2 trillion market cap to a $3 trillion market cap in under 100 days.\n\nThat begs the question: which tech giant will hit the next big milestone, $4 trillion in market cap, first? Some bears argue that big tech companies\u2019 record run of performance can\u2019t continue forever, given their elevated valuations and the slowing economy, while the bulls believe this is just the beginning of a streak of AI-induced wins for big tech.\n\n\u201cI think, a year from now, we [will] have three $4 trillion market cap companies: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft,\u201d Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told Fortune.\n\nHe argued that many of his peers on Wall Street continue to underestimate the AI revolution and the health of the U.S. economy. \u201cUnless you have a telescope, you can't find a recession. And the Fed? Their next move is a cut not a hike. So, to me, all signs are bullish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's 9 pm, and the party goes to 4 am\u2026the haters will hate, continuing to say that this is a bubble.\u201d\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nNvidia\n\nThere are, of course, a wide range of views on where big tech companies are headed, but many experts are convinced that chip giant Nvidia will be the first to reach the $4 trillion market cap mark, driven by the seemingly unending thirst for its AI-enabling hardware.\n\n\u201cThe first one to get there is likely to be the godfather of AI Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia, because they\u2019re the only game in town\u2014their GPUs are the new oil or gold in the tech world with no real competition,\u201d Ives said.\n\nNvidia stock has surged roughly 160% year to date and more than 3,000% over the past five years. That\u2019s led some analysts to warn that the tech giant\u2019s valuation has become stretched, and doesn\u2019t account for rising competition in the semiconductor market.\n\nAs David Trainer, founder and CEO of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune\u2019s Shawn Tully last month: \u201cNvidia\u2019s valuation is ridiculous. It\u2019s facing the same curse as Tesla. But when Tesla got profitable, loads of competitors entered the EV space, cutting margins and slowing sales. The same will happen with Nvidia.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Ives noted that even though Nvidia\u2019s shares have surged, its revenues and earnings have followed suit. Nvidia raked in a record $26 billion in revenues and $14.8 billion in net income in the quarter that ended this April. In 2021, during the same quarter, the company had revenues of just $5.8 billion and net income of $1.9 billion.\n\nLouis Navellier, founder and chairman of family office Navellier & Associates, also brushed off the competition argument, claiming Nvidia essentially has a \u201cmonopoly\u201d on key AI chips which will lead to consistent sales and earnings growth for years to come. \u201cAnd, you know, Jensen is kind of like the new Elon, he\u2019s got kind of a cult status,\u201d he said, adding that will continue to drive retail investors in the stock.\n\nNvidia\u2019s market capitalization as of July 5: $3.14 trillion\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s booming cloud business and big investment into ChatGPT creator OpenAI have buoyed its shares over the past few years. But it\u2019s the company\u2019s diverse and sustainable revenue streams that will lead it to a $4 trillion market cap, according to Tim Pagliara, founder and chief investment officer of independent wealth management firm CapWealth.\n\nHe said Nvidia may briefly touch the $4 trillion milestone first, due to what he called the current AI \u201cmania,\u201d but Microsoft will be the \u201cmore sustainable\u201d $4 trillion company.\n\n\u201cThey're embracing AI, but they also have just a tremendous number of things in the pipeline. And I know as a small business owner, we just gladly keep paying them more per user per month for everything from Azure to some of the additional add ons that they have created for security and things like that,\u201d he added, referencing Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing business.\n\nPagliara thinks Microsoft\u2019s big tech rivals have riskier business models as well. Apple is dependent on consumers buying into its new iPhone offerings every few years, and Nvidia is benefiting from a lack of competition in the near term, he said. Meanwhile, Microsoft has multiple avenues for consistent revenue growth from the Azure cloud business and Office 365 to Windows and Linkedin.\n\nMarket cap: $3.48 trillion\n\nApple\n\nWhen it comes to a longer-term outlook, Apple is high on many analysts\u2019 lists because of its potential to use AI to get customers to upgrade their current phones and lure in more iPhone customers. It may not be the first to reach a $4 trillion market cap, but it will get there soon, these bulls say.\n\n\u201cI think over the next two, three years, the largest market cap that we will see is Apple, because they have 2.2 billion iOS devices,\u201d Ives predicted. \u201cConsumer AI is going to go through the walls for Cupertino\u2014they are only in the beginning of an AI-driven supercycle.\u201d\n\nLouis Navellier was also optimistic about Apple\u2019s future, but he said it will need a few \u201clittle breakthroughs\u201d to get more customers to buy new iPhones.\n\nHe pointed to new AI tools and the potential for folding iPhones as examples. \u201cI don't know if they're going to announce that in September, but if they do, it will be a $2,500 phone, and it will sell like crazy and send that stock soaring.\u201d\n\nMarket cap: $3.46 trillion\n\nWhat about Alphabet and Amazon?\n\nThe Google parent\u2019s market cap is currently $2.36 trillion, leaving it well shy of the $4 trillion mark. Analysts said Alphabet will be able to capitalize on the AI revolution, but its missteps with hallucinations have left it behind, and its cloud business isn\u2019t performing as well as others. However, the search giant is taking talent from its peers in an attempt to catch up, recent reports have shown.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar story for Amazon, which just recently passed the $2 trillion milestone, and experts expect it will take time for share prices to nearly double. Wedbush\u2019s Ives argued that Amazon\u2019s cloud business, AWS, has also lost out to Microsoft. \u201c\u200b\u200bI think there was some hubris in underestimating what Nadella and Microsoft are doing, and with the crosstown rivals and in that 2-0-6 area code, it's been a bit of a gut punch for Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when it comes to AI, Amazon is just \u201cbehind the eightball\u201d too, according to the veteran tech analyst. However, Ives noted that CEO Andy Jassy has made changes to the company\u2019s cloud business, and with a massive base of customers, Amazon should benefit more from AI moving forward.\n\nTo be sure, every tech giant on this list also faces risks. Antitrust regulations, cyber attacks, a slowing economy, and a reduction in AI spending should all be considered. But for now, the bulls remain bullish\u2013and they think you should be too.\n\n\u201cThe tech bears with their spreadsheets and valuations will stay in hibernation mode,\u201d Ives said. \u201cBut when everyone meets for breakfast at 6 am after this AI party. The bulls [will have] won and the bears just sound smart.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

As we navigate through 2024, now is\u00a0a great\u00a0time for investors to consider the best\u00a0tech stocks to buy.\n\nThe convergence of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and digital payments has accelerated the transformation of businesses.\u00a0In the last decade, retail\u00a0investors\u00a0and institutional investors have\u00a0made a fortune\u00a0from tech stocks.\u00a0Despite headwinds in the broader economy\u00a0over the last\u00a024 months, the technology sector\u2019s resilience remains unwavering.\u00a0A myriad of\u00a0companies have emerged even\u00a0stronger, significantly expanding their revenue, earnings per share and market position.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a stable giant with a diversified portfolio, a\u00a0leader in semiconductors, or a pioneer in fintech, the tech market has something to offer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the three best tech stocks\u00a0to buy\u00a0in July 2024!\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) is undoubtedly one of the best tech stocks\u00a0to buy\u00a0in 2024.\u00a0Its valuation is still reasonable\u00a0as\u00a0compared to many of its\u00a0mega cap\u00a0tech competitors in artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\n\nIf you\u2019re not living under a rock, there is a strong likelihood that you have heard of Alphabet or used its products before.\u00a0Alphabet,\u00a0through its parent company, Google, is the largest search engine in the world.\u00a0It currently holds more than 90% market share in search engine technology. This competitive advantage in the marketplace has contributed immensely to the company\u2019s growth at Google Search and YouTube. Moreover, its cloud computing arm, Google Cloud, will gain momentum in 2024. In\u00a0Q1 FY24, Google Search and YouTube both delivered impressive double-digit growth.\u00a0Additionally, its cloud revenue increased 28%\u00a0year over year\u00a0to $9.6 billion. The company\u2019s diverse revenue streams, including advertising, cloud services, and hardware products, provide a solid foundation for long-term growth. As digital advertising rebounds and cloud adoption accelerates, Alphabet is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a global leader in advanced semiconductors,\u00a0plays a pivotal role\u00a0in the development and deployment of 5G technology. The company\u2019s\u00a0cutting edge\u00a0chipsets and intellectual property in wireless communications make it a critical player in the tech sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm was once a struggling tech stock, especially after its slump in the 2023 fiscal year.\u00a0While many of its semiconductor counterparts rebounded, Qualcomm\u2019s business continued to suffer.\u00a0Firstly, the brunt of higher interest rates heavily affected its bottom line, as well as\u00a0the continued slowdown in the handset market.\u00a0However, the tide is turning and its Snapdragon platform is\u00a0extremely promising. Its processors include a full suite of AI solutions for smartphones, laptops, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.\u00a0Additionally, its Snapdragon X Elite AI CPUs are said to run AI models 2X faster than its competitors.\u00a0This\u00a0explains why\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) chose Qualcomm\u2019s arm-based AI chips to power its new surface PCs. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18, QCOM stock is among the best tech stocks\u00a0to buy\u00a0in 2024.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP),\u00a0while\u00a0traditionally known as a financial services company,\u00a0AXP\u00a0has made significant strides in digital payments and financial technology.\u00a0The company\u2019s investments in technology have transformed it into\u00a0a financial\u00a0powerhouse, providing a range of innovative payment solutions and digital services.\n\nAmerican Express\u2019 focus on enhancing its digital capabilities has paid off, with its mobile and online platforms gaining widespread adoption.\u00a0Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions in\u00a0the\u00a0fintech\u00a0space\u00a0have further strengthened its market position.\u00a0For example, its acquisition of Kabbage in August 2020 has expanded its offerings to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). AMEX is also advancing its digital payments platform with the introduction of digital wallets and tokenization. After delivering strong financial performance in FY23, management anticipates double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth in 2024.

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 68% of His Foundation's $46 Billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Phenomenal Stocks",
        "content": "Bill Gates is one of the best-known billionaires in the world.\n\nThe Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) founder became the first centibillionaire in 1999, decades before anyone else reached that level of wealth. He's still worth well over $100 billion today despite giving away billions to charitable causes and nonprofits over the past 25 years. Most of his donations go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to enhance healthcare and reduce poverty around the world.\n\nGates isn't the only centibiliionaire funding the nonprofit. Warren Buffett has also pledged donations to the foundation since 2006, but those contributions will end after his death. Buffett also served as a trustee until 2021.\n\nThe foundation's trust includes an equity portfolio valued at around $46 billion today, but over two-thirds of that amount, about 68%, is invested in just three stocks.\n\n1. Microsoft (37%)\n\nIt's probably not a huge surprise that Microsoft makes up a significant chunk of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Bill Gates founded the company in 1975 and remains one of the largest individual shareholders despite donating and selling millions of shares worth tens of billions of dollars.\n\nGates made a $20 billion donation in 2022, and a large portion of that donation appears to have been in the form of Microsoft stock. The trust's share count increased by over 38 million that year. It now has about 36.5 million shares worth nearly $16.8 billion, as of this writing.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been able to hold on to most of those shares, and it's paid off handsomely. Microsoft shares are up more than 63% since the end of July 2022, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft has become a leader in AI, thanks in part to its investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It added $10 billion to its investment in early 2023, which positioned it as a top choice for developers looking to use the public cloud to train and deploy AI-powered applications. AI-related services helped drive its Azure cloud platform revenue growth of 31% in its most recent quarter. That's faster growth than anyone else in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft remains a dominant force in enterprise software with its Windows OS and Office productivity suite. It's adding enhanced AI features and seeing strong traction in sales.\n\nMicrosoft's shares trade for a high valuation of about 34 times forward earnings. But with a long runway for growth in cloud computing and AI, the cash cow of its enterprise software business, and its current cash position, it may be worth the high multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Waste Management (16%)\n\nWaste Management(NYSE: WM) isn't the kind of company you think of when you think of when you think of a tech billionaire. But Gates is probably more influenced by Buffett than by Silicon Valley's tech elite. Waste Management is a textbook Buffett stock.\n\nThe business is easily understood, it's absolutely boring, and it provides stable and growing revenue. The company benefits from a wide economic moat derived from its landfill ownership and route density. That allows Waste Management to increase its pricing faster than inflation. The company also grows from acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Stericycle.\n\nThe company's also found ways to reduce costs over the past decade. Its operating margin climbed from around 15% 10 years ago to 19.4% over the trailing 12 months.\n\nGates has held shares of Waste Management for the foundation trust for over a decade, doubling down on the position in 2022. The position has paid off well, as the stock's total return over the past decade has more than doubled the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of about 17.25, which is comparable with its closest competitors. While it might be a bit expensive for a boring businesses, Waste Management's strong position in its stalwart industry might make the stock worth the price for someone looking for a stable utility.\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (15%)\n\nAs mentioned, Buffett has been a longtime contributor to the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation. The way Buffett donates his wealth is by converting his Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares (NYSE: BRK.A) into Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares (NYSE: BRK.B). He then donates the Class B shares.\n\nThe maneuver allows Buffett to retain control of Berkshire Hathaway while giving away much of his wealth. He donates about 5% of his remaining shares to various nonprofits every year.\n\nThe trust's current position in Berkshire Hathaway is actually one of the lowest levels of concentration in the stock. Buffett's donation stipulates the foundation spend the entire value of his contribution each year plus 5% of its net assets. In effect, Buffett's making sure the foundation doesn't stockpile Berkshire stock. That's resulted in a steadily declining share count over the past few years, as Berkshire stock has increased in value.\n\nThere's good reason to expect Berkshire to outperform the S&P 500. First, its forward P/E of just 18.5 presents good value to the market. That's despite Buffett's assertion that the company's current mix of wholly and partially owned businesses present better earnings prospects than the average American corporation. That valuation is made even more attractive when you account for the $189 billion in cash and treasury bonds on Berkshire's balance sheet, the strong free cash flow of Berkshire's core operations, and Buffett's consistent share repurchases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street investors have been paying close attention to the growth of the cloud computing sector. According to a recent survey, 94% of major companies worldwide utilize cloud computing in their operations. Businesses are migrating their operations and data onto cloud platforms, seeking the benefits of scalability, cost-efficiency and enhanced security. From remote workforces to on-demand storage, cloud solutions offer agility and flexibility that traditional IT infrastructure simply can\u2019t match.\n\nMeanwhile, cloud platforms are continuously evolving, offering new features and services such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced analytics. Companies that invest in these technologies can gain a competitive edge, making cloud providers indispensable partners.\n\nFurther highlighting the sector\u2019s strength, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY) has already gained over 12% year-to-date (YTD). SKYY is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) providing exposure to U.S. companies involved in the cloud computing industry. This strong performance reflects the high demand from investors seeking a diversified play on the cloud computing industry. With that being said, here are three best cloud computing stocks that could be prime candidates for significant growth in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of best cloud computing stocks is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Unequivocally regarded as the global e-commerce leader, Amazon\u2019s reach extends far beyond online retail. Through Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has become a dominant player in the cloud computing industry, too. AWS offers a comprehensive suite of on-demand cloud computing services, including storage, compute power, databases, networking, analytics, and machine learning.\n\nAmazon delivered solid first quarter of fiscal year 2024 results, with net sales climbing 13% year-over-year (YOY) to $143.3 billion. Investors noted that AWS revenue jumped by 17% to $25 billion. Furthermore, net income and diluted EPS both skyrocketed around 220% to $10.4 billion and 98 cents, respectively.\n\nIn late April, AWS announced the launch of Amazon Q, a powerful generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistant. Amazon Q is designed to improve software development tasks, such as generating, testing and transforming code. This AI tool could also empower businesses to leverage internal data, streamlining data utilization across various departments.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, AMZN stock has soared more than 30%. \u00a0The shares are trading at 41.2 times forward earnings and 3.5 times sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $220 for AMZN, signaling a 10% upside potential.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nWindows and Office, the operating system and productivity suite, have cemented Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a household name. However, a significant growth engine for MSFT in recent years has been Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform. Azure offers a robust portfolio of cloud solutions, including virtual machines, storage, databases, analytics and AI tools.\n\nMicrosoft, the second name among our best cloud computing stocks to buy, delivered a robust fiscal third-quarter report with revenue climbing 17% YOY to $61.9 billion. This growth was fueled by surging demand for Microsoft Cloud services, which saw revenue surge 23% YOY to $35.1 billion. Profitability also improved, as net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 20%, reaching $21.9 billion and $2.94 respectively.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft Azure is addressing developer needs with its new stock keeping unit (SKU) for its Azure Bastion service: Bastion Developer. This low-cost, zero-configuration solution offers secure-by-default connectivity to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). It also eliminates the need for complex configurations, public IP addresses and other security risks traditionally associated with VM access.\n\nMSFT stock has surged more than 22% YTD. The shares are currently trading at 43.3 times forward earnings and 14.4 times sales. Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $480 for MSFT, suggesting 5% upside.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRounding out our discussion of best cloud computing stocks is ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW).\u00a0While not directly providing cloud computing infrastructure, ServiceNow instead focuses on a specialized cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for enterprise workflow management.\n\nIts \u201cNow Platform\u201d streamlines digital workflows across various IT operations functions, including incident management, problem resolution and change management. This cloud-based approach allows enterprises to automate processes, improve efficiency, and gain real-time visibility into their IT operations.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, ServiceNow reported robust financials, with total revenues exceeding $2.6 billion for 24% YOY growth. Current remaining performance obligations grew 21% YOY to $8.45 billion. Net income totaled $707 million while diluted EPS came in at $3.41.\n\nServiceNow and Microsoft have recently strengthened their strategic alliance by integrating their GenAI capabilities. This collaboration brings together ServiceNow\u2019s Now Assist and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, where each AI assistant can automatically identify the most relevant context to assist the user.\n\nNOW stock has jumped almost 12% YTD. The shares are trading at a rich valuation of 56.4 times forward earnings and 17.2 times sales. Finally, analysts have a 12-month price target of $850 for ServiceNow stock, around an 8% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Worth a Read! 3 Hot Publishing Stocks to Buy This Summer.",
        "content": "Publishing stocks are shares of companies that publish books, newspapers, magazines, literature, journals, educational materials and other forms of media.\n\nMost folks tend to overlook publishing stocks because they don\u2019t find them as glamorous as tech or exciting startups. Also, there\u2019s a perception that the publishing industry is circling the drain \u2014 due to competition from digital platforms.\n\nAs such, you\u2019re not likely to find the average investor scouring through financial news to identify which publishing stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough it had to adapt to inevitable technological shifts (cue e-readers, audiobooks and so on), just like any other industry, the publishing industry is thriving \u2014 if the companies below are anything to go by.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to diversify your investment portfolio, publishing stocks could be an interesting option. Here are our top picks for hot publishing stocks to buy this summer.\n\nEducational Development (EDUC) GNS stock: a child in front of a laptop taking notes while viewing an online class\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEducational Development (NASDAQ:EDUC) is a publishing company for children\u2019s books. It sells its books via two business segments. The first is PaperPie \u2014 its home business division that sells directly to consumers at parties, book fairs, schools, public libraries and more.\n\nThe other segment is a retail division that sells books and educational materials to bookstores, toy stores, specialty shops, museums and other locations.\n\nThough the company has almost nil analyst coverage, it\u2019s one of the best-performing stocks in 2024. After opening the year at the ballpark price of $1.14, EDUC shares are now going for $1.86 a piece \u2014 a change of 63% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all. EDUC\u2019s price has more than doubled at various points in the year, returning over 100%. There\u2019s no reason why Educational Development can\u2019t continue with that trajectory throughout the rest of the year. It\u2019s definitely among the best publishing stocks in the market right now.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been dubbed \u201cThe Everything Company,\u201d thanks to venturing into pretty much nearly every conceivable market and industry, from e-commerce to cloud computing to entertainment to publishing.\n\nThe company has Amazon Publishing (APub), whose portfolio includes several imprints across different genres, including AmazonEncore, AmazonCrossing, Thomas & Mercer, Montlake Romance and the e-reader Kindle.\n\nObviously, Amazon is not a pure-play publishing stock. But it\u2019s one of the best in the market for investors who want exposure to the publishing sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust last week, the company crossed $2 trillion in market cap for the first time, joining just one of four others to do so. Shares of the company have added 30% YTD.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly recommend buying Amazon stock. Out of 65 ratings, 53 recommend buying, with 9 rating it Overweight and just 3 rating it Neutral.\n\nWith such a strong market presence and performance, Amazon is a great starting point to dip your toes in publishing stocks.\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons (WLY) text books on a desk with a chalkboard in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJohn Wiley & Sons (NYSE:WLY) is another under-the-radar publishing stock but one you might want to look into this summer. Despite mixed Q4 results for its 2024 fiscal year, the New Jersey-based publisher\u2019s shares have returned over 36% YTD.\n\nThe company reported a Research revenue loss of 3% for the fourth quarter and the year but an 18% increase in Learning for the quarter. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) also sunk 19% for the fiscal year.\n\nHowever, it seems the market shrugged off the mixed results and is focusing on the company\u2019s long-term outlook based on its forecasts.\u00a0The company expects adjusted EPS to reach $3.43 at the midpoint in Fiscal 2025 \u2014 a 23% jump. WLY also said it is on target to hit its 2026 goals.\n\nThe Wiley company has been around for over two centuries and is one of the most trusted publishing brands in the industry. It has partnerships with household names across different industries, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the Culinary Institute of America, the National Geographic Society and the London School of Economics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Strong cash flows reflect financial stability, allowing companies to pay down debt, pursue growth opportunities, and shell out dividend payments.\n\nThese companies are also better equipped to weather downturns, providing another beneficial advantage for investors from a long-term standpoint.\n\nAnd for those seeking cash-generating machines, three mega-cap giants \u2013 Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL \u2013 all fit the criteria nicely. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how each currently stacks up.\n\nApple Shares Bounce Back\n\nApple shares have jumped back into favor over the last month after a notably slow start to 2024, gaining 15% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Favorable news concerning its China iPhone shipments has aided performance, with recent commentary surrounding AI also providing tailwinds. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has long been a cash-generating machine, providing many benefits over the years, including higher dividend payouts. In fact, Apple raised its quarterly payout in its latest quarterly release, reflecting the 12th consecutive year of higher payouts.\n\nShares yield a modest 0.5% annually, though the company\u2019s 4.9% five-year annualized dividend growth helps bridge the gap. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have positively revised their earnings expectations for the mega-cap giant, landing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though the revisions haven\u2019t been robust, it\u2019s undoubtedly a bullish development for the stock and provides the fuel needed to continue outperformance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Posts Strong Cloud Results\n\nMicrosoft shares have helped lead the market\u2019s charge all year long, up nearly 25% and seeing regular positivity following quarterly results. Analysts have revised their earnings expectations for its current fiscal year consistently over the last year, with the $11.77 per share expected up roughly 9% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which was present for a few periods, but the recent results overall paint positivity moving forward. Like AAPL, strong cash flows have aided its shareholder-friendly nature, with Microsoft sporting a 10% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nAlphabet Stays in Growth Mode\n\nAlphabet shares have experienced positivity all throughout 2024, up nearly 40%. Like MSFT, the revisions trend for its current fiscal year has been notably positive, with the $7.60 per share expected climbing 14% over the last year.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company positively shocked investors when it announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend back in April. Alphabet\u2019s cash-generating nature allows for future dividend growth, with the company posting $16.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nAnd to little surprise, the mega-cap giant remains firmly in growth mode, as consensus expectations suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 14% higher sales in FY24. Growth spills over to FY25, with earnings and revenue forecasted to climb 13% and 12%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCompanies boasting strong cash-generating abilities can be great investments, as they have plenty of cash to fuel growth, pay out dividends, and easily wipe out debt. And as mentioned above, these companies are better equipped to handle an economic downturn, undeniably a positive.\n\nFor those seeking cash-generators, all three companies above \u2013 Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, and Alphabet GOOGL \u2013 fit the criteria nicely.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Intel And AMD Are Going For A Bigger Role In The AI Era, But At A Gradual Pace\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) undoubtedly had an early lead in the AI chip race, but its rivals are doing their best to challenge its dominance. After more than one failed attempt to discreetly enter the GPU arena, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), the largest producer of PC and server CPUs, might be slow but seems to be playing the long game. Then there\u2019s Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) who is already promising to challenge Nvidia with its new chips.\n\nIntel is playing the long game.\n\nAccording to PassMark Software, Intel still controls 64% of the x86 CPU market, but it has undoubtedly given a lot of market share to AMD over the years. AMD pulled ahead with cheaper and more advanced CPUs while Intel struggled to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power-efficient CPUs on its own, grappling with delays and shortages.\n\nShares tumbled upon its latest quarterly report as sales were short of estimates and Intel provided a weak forecast for the current quarter. But, Gaudi 3 release is expected to bring in more than\u00a0$500 million in sales\u00a0during the second half of the year.\n\nIntel is also setting itself apart from AMD and Nvidia with competitive pricing. It is also betting big\u00a0on becoming\u00a0a leading player in the foundry market by opening chip fabs throughout the U.S., which is a costly move\u00a0as Intel does not expect\u00a0to break even on this front before 2027.\n\nBut, when it comes to AI, Intel is playing the long game. Intel launched new AI accelerators this year. It\u00a0\u00a0started expanding its manufacturing capacity as it aims to become the leading AI chip fabricator. Intel made crucial changes to its business model, with these efforts and investments promising to result in significant benefits over the next decade. It is undoubtedly going for a bigger piece of the AI pie with the launch of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 accelerators, which are capable of running AI workloads for data centers.\n\nAMD restructured its business to prioritize AI.\n\nLaunching its own AI GPUs and signing big fish clients like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), AMD's second-largest market share in GPUs position it well for the AI race. Also, AMD is capable of filling in the supply gaps that Nvidia might not be able to meet.\n\nBut even AMD didn\u2019t provide an impressive earnings report. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue rose only 2% YoY to slightly over $5 billion and while it recorded revenue revenue gains of over 80% in its data center and client segments, client and gaming segments declined 40%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in June, AMD introduced an upcoming series of chips. Expected to be available in 2025, the MI350 will be based on new chip architecture, promising to perform 35 times better in inference - the process of computing generative AI responses, compared to its currently available MI300 series. Additionally, AMD unveiled the MI400 series, which is scheduled for 2026 and will be based on an architecture called \"Next\".\n\nBut Nvidia is not staying still as also in June,\u00a0it announced its next-generation AI chip platform called Rubin, it set to launch in 2026, and it would include GPUs, CPUs and networking chips.

        "content": "Inflation continues to be a concern, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The\u00a0May inflation reading only came in at 2.6%. The month-to-month rate of inflation was the coolest in more than four years.\n\nLower inflation can lead to interest rate cuts that fuel the stock market. However, a\u00a0cooler\u00a0inflation reading is still inflation. Your money lost 2.6% of its purchasing power on a year-over-year basis.\n\nInvestors can load up on dividend stocks with high payouts to navigate inflation. Some corporations hike their dividend distributions by more than 10%\u00a0annually to keep investors on board. This high growth rate comfortably breezes past inflation and will increase your purchasing power.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA high dividend growth rate usually indicates a\u00a0successful\u00a0corporation that can reward long-term investors. Corporations can only maintain high dividend growth rates if their revenue and net income\u00a0grow. These inflation-busting dividend stocks\u00a0deliver high payouts and returns for long-term investors.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc.

Texas Roadhouse reported strong financials in the first quarter. Revenue increased by 12.5% while\u00a0net income\u00a0increased\u00a0by 31% from a year ago. The company closed out the quarter with an 8.6% net profit margin.\n\nTexas Roadhouse restaurants continue to attract and retain new customers. Same-store sales increased by 8.4% year-over-year at company-owned restaurants. The growth rate was 7.7% year-over-year for domestic franchise restaurants. Texas Roadhouse has 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise restaurants.

The company operates in multiple industries and is a top firm in most of them.\u00a0Microsoft is the second-largest cloud computing provider, generating $35.1 billion from its cloud platform this quarter.\u00a0That\u2019s a 23% year-over-year growth rate, and Microsoft Cloud made up more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s overall numbers were also impressive. Revenue increased by 17% while\u00a0net income\u00a0was up\u00a0by 20%. Microsoft closed out the quarter with a 35.5% net profit margin.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock and believe\u00a0that it\u00a0has more room to run. The\u00a0average price target suggests a 9% upside from current levels. Many analysts have been raising their price targets, but the highest target currently\u00a0stands at\u00a0$600 per share. Microsoft offers a 0.6% yield and raised its dividend by 10% last year.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) trades at a reasonable P/E ratio of 19x and offers a 1.2% yield. Shares are up by 25% year-to-date and gained 88% over the past five years. American Express has regularly maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years, including a 17% hike earlier this year.\n\nThe fintech firm receives a percentage of each transaction from its debit and credit cards.\u00a0American Express offers enticing rewards through its cards,\u00a0which gives\u00a0them more appeal than cash.\u00a0The firm\u2019s credit cards have been a big hit with younger generations and helped to fuel 11% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0the first quarter. Net income jumped by 34% in the quarter, resulting in a 16.9% net profit margin.\n\nAmerican Express\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a\u00a0\u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The highest price target of $275 per share implies a potential upside of 17%. The company offers a more reasonable valuation and better growth prospects than other credit card issuers.\n\nBadger Meter (BMI) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.\n\nSource: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com\n\nBadger Meter (NYSE:BMI) is a water solutions company that uses advanced technology to monitor\u00a0water quality and flow. The Company has been crushing the stock market with a 20% year-to-date return and a 215% five-year gain. The stock trades at a P/E of 54x and offers a 0.6% yield.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to find a corporation that has regularly raised its dividend by 10% or more each year,\u00a0it\u2019s even more challenging to find\u00a0a stock in Badger Meter\u2019s class.\u00a0Last year, the water solutions provider\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend from 22.5 cents\u00a0per share\u00a0to 27 cents per share. That\u2019s a 20% year-over-year increase,\u00a0which\u00a0comfortably exceeds the inflation rate.\n\nRevenue and earnings growth both looked good in the\u00a0first quarter.

It\u2019s not producing the same growth numbers as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but Broadcom has established itself as a top AI beneficiary. The stock is approaching an $800 billion market cap and can realistically have a $1 trillion market cap within the next one to two years.\n\nMomentum with AI stocks is still strong, and Broadcom has\u00a0certainly\u00a0earned the attention. The tech firm reported 43% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Broadcom also raised its annual revenue guidance, suggesting that growth will accelerate. Revenue from AI products reached a record $3.1 billion in the quarter.\n\nBroadcom has outperformed the stock market by a wide margin. Shares are up by 52% year-to-date and have surged by 485% over the past five years. A recently announced 10-for-1 stock split has brought more attention to the stock. The company\u00a0offers\u00a0a 1.3% yield and\u00a0raised its dividend by 14% for fiscal 2024.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) regularly delivers net profit margins above 50% while increasing shareholder value. The stock is up by 50% over the past five years and offers a 0.8% yield.\u00a0Visa\u00a0makes\u00a0revenue from each transaction,\u00a0which makes\u00a0it a good choice for beating inflation.\n\nThe fintech firm also delivered a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Visa continued that trend with a\u00a015.6% dividend hike last year. The dividend hike also came with the announcement of a $25 billion buyback.\n\nVisa also reported solid\u00a0Q2 FY24 financials with 10% year-over-year\u00a0revenue and net income growth.\u00a0Cross-border volume was a\u00a0major\u00a0growth catalyst that increased by 16% from a year ago. Visa isn\u2019t the type of stock that significantly outperforms the stock market, but it gives investors\u00a0an edge over inflation for several decades.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish about the company\u2019s long-term potential.\u00a0The stock has received a\u00a0\u201cstrong buy\u201d rating and has a projected 19% upside\u00a0based on the average price target.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) recently hiked its quarterly dividend from 57 cents per share to 66 cents per share, marking a 15.8% year-over-year increase. Like Visa and American Express, Mastercard offers a high dividend growth rate and is positioned to keep pace with inflation.\n\nThe fintech firm reported $6.3 million in net revenue in the first quarter. That\u2019s a 10% year-over-year improvement. Net income increased by 28% from a year ago as the company continued to expand its profit margins. Mastercard closed out the quarter with a 47.4% net profit margin. Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach cited 18% cross-border volume growth in the press release and mentioned that the company ended up with \u201cnew deal wins in every region.\u201d\n\nMastercard stock has delivered solid gains for investors.

        "content": "Microcap investing is undoubtedly risky. However, the thinly traded nature of microcap stocks often contributes to asymmetrical upside returns. Moreover, numerous microcap stocks are secured by emerging entities, meaning investors benefit from future growth prospects.\n\nIn the past month, the iShares Micro-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:IWC) has shed nearly 5% of its market value, suggesting a \u201cbuy the dip opportunity\u201d has emerged in microcap stocks as a sub-asset class. However, as previously mentioned, microcap stocks are thinly traded mainly due to their lack of exposure. As such, I embarked on a journey to seek information about three best-in-class microcap stocks.\n\nConsidering the above, I applied a screening process examining fundamental aspects, valuation multiples and idiosyncratic events. Moreover, I ensured each pick didn\u2019t have negative press surrounding it, as many microcap stocks often do.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for microcap stocks, here are three stocks under $3 with breakout potential worth considering.\n\nCommScope (COMM) small-cap stocks: a ticker board that says \"SMALL CAP\" among various ticker increases. represents small-cap stocks to buy. Small-Cap Stock Picks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommScope (NASDAQ:COMM) is a U.S.-based company that designs, manufactures and installs network infrastructure products. Its stock trades at around $1.15 per share after sustaining a year-to-date loss of nearly 60% due to internal and systematic events. Despite its capitulation, COMM stock is a good investment; here\u2019s why.\n\nFirstly, COMM stock\u2019s sharp decline has dragged its price multiples into relatively undervalued territory. For example, COMM stock now has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 0.05x! Additionally, CommScope delivered a stellar first-quarter earnings report in May, revealing a revenue beat of $100 million and an earnings-per-share beat of 16 cents, providing a potential turning point.\n\nCommScope faces risks, namely a struggle for profitability and a recent downgrade by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Nevertheless, I think the company\u2019s ten-year compound annual growth rate of 3.9% will coalesce with its price multiples and recent earnings beat, leading COMM stock into a recovery.\n\nI\u2019m bullish here!\n\nRimini Street (RMNI) image of a large business man looking at a small businessman standing in the palm of his hand\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRimini Street (NASDAQ:RMNI) provides end-market software support to companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). The firm has over 2,100 employees globally, supports over 600 software products and claims to have saved its customers over $8 billion. Although a small-cap firm, Rimini\u2019s salient features suggest it is bound to scale.\n\nI decided to explore the company due to its nimble business model, which operates at a low-cost base and services a niche requirement. Moreover, I think Rimini Street will benefit from the systematic growth embedded in the cloud industry, providing it with a comprehensive opportunity set. Rimini\u2019s current results show that it has already benefitted from the above, achieving profitability and a steady Return on Assets (ROA) ratio of 8.07%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Rimini Street\u2019s short-term variables are well-aligned. It released its first-quarter earnings report in May, beating its estimate by $490,000, concurrently dragging its price-to-sales ratio (currently 0.6x) into investable territory.\n\nAs with CommScope, RMNI is risky but possesses upside potential.\n\nGrafTech International (EAF)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGrafTech (NYSE:EAF) International manufactures graphite electrodes and petroleum coke, serving an array of end markets. The company is headquartered in Ohio but operates a nimble manufacturing ecosystem with facilities in other U.S. states, Mexico and Europe. Although a small-cap stock, I have tremendous belief in GrafTech, given the ever-increasing demand for industrial goods and the company\u2019s niche business model.\n\nThe firm recently proved its potential when it surpassed its first-quarter earnings estimates. GrafTech\u2019s revenue settled at $136.58 million, exceeding its target by $10.89 million. Moreover, GrafTech\u2019s earnings-per-share surpassed estimates by three cents. Although a point-in-time observation, GrafTech\u2019s first-quarter report illustrates a turning point after the firm suffered disappointing results.\n\nFurthermore, GrafTech might benefit from market-impact-related activities. On May 17th, its largest shareholder, Colonial House Capital, bought an additional 332,770 shares at around $1.72 per unit. Although Colonial House\u2019s rationale is unclear, the event suggests that GrafTech\u2019s fundamental prospects might be underestimated.\n\nFinally, EAF stock has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 0.42x, indicating it has absolute value in store.\n\nI\u2019m bullish about EAF stock\u2019s prospects, as I think a turnaround opportunity is in the cards!\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hiring Steve Ballmer Was One Of Bill Gates' Early Moves At Microsoft. Now, AI Has Helped Ballmer Surpass Gates On The Billionaire's Index\n\nSteve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, was one of Bill Gates\u2019 early hires, joining the company in 1980 as its 30th employee. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he joined as an assistant to the president, serving more as a business manager than a PA to the owner and CEO, Bill Gates.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\n\nIn Microsoft\u2019s early days, Ballmer led the sales and operations teams, and his share of the profits quickly grew as the company took off because he worked out a deal where he would earn a $50,000 base salary plus 10% of any profit growth he generated.\n\nThe profit-sharing deal quickly became too much for Microsoft, so Ballmer traded it for company shares. He negotiated an 8% stake for himself, while Bill Gates and Paul Allen kept 84%, and another 8% was set aside for other employees. Fortune reports that although Allen didn\u2019t want to give Ballmer such a large share, Gates stepped in and agreed to reduce his own holdings to accommodate Ballmer\u2019s 8%. When he became CEO in 2000, his Microsoft shares were worth nearly $2 billion.\n\nAlthough he arguably wasn\u2019t the one who was the most responsible for spearheading Microsoft into the powerhouse it is today, Ballmer\u2019s energetic and sometimes unconventional leadership style left a lasting imprint on the company, contributing to its dynamic corporate culture and innovative drive.\n\nThis is how Steve Ballmer used to do Microsoft presentations when he was the CEO\r\nSteve Ballmer's boisterous presentation style is characterized by his energetic and enthusiastic demeanor, often involving loud, bombastic speeches and physical antics on stage.

People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing with just $100\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth has recently jumped to $158 billion, surpassing Bill Gates, who has $157 billion, and making Ballmer the sixth-richest person globally, surpassing industry titans like Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Sergey Brin.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of Ballmer's wealth \u2014 over 90% \u2014 comes from his many Microsoft shares. When he left the company in 2014, he owned nearly 333 million shares, about 4% of the company. According to reports, he received $1 billion in dividends from Microsoft in 2024 alone. He also bought the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion.\n\nSteve Ballmer\u2019s wealth has increased significantly recently because of big advances in artificial intelligence that have boosted Microsoft\u2019s stock price. Microsoft has been investing heavily in AI, especially with companies like OpenAI, and this has caused its stock to go up by about 36% since July 2023. In 2023 alone, Ballmer\u2019s net worth increased by $30 billion because of these AI advancements.\n\nBill Gates, on the other hand, has diversified his investments. Now worth $157 billion, Gates has invested significantly in Cascade Investment, which he created using profits from selling Microsoft stock and dividends. Gates also has a $21 billion stake in Republic Services Inc., a waste-management company, through Cascade.\n\nSteve Ballmer is one of the 26 billionaires in the U.S. who made their fortunes by climbing the corporate ladder. His journey shows how working up in big companies can yield huge financial rewards and how investing in company stocks and taking leadership roles can significantly boost one\u2019s wealth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk\u2019s secret mansion in Austin revealed through court filings.

        "content": "Investing.com-- The S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday on bets that Federal Reserve rate rate cuts may soon be on the horizon after the June monthly jobs report pointing to cooling in the labor market.\n\nAt 15:43 ET (19:53 GMT), the S&P 500 gained 0.5% to a record high of 5,566.75 , the NASDAQ Composite climbed 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2%, or 68 points.\n\nTreasury yields nosedive after payrolls point to cooling labor market\n\nTreasury yields came under pressure after the monthly jobs report for June showed the economy added 206,000 jobs last month, down from 218,000 in May, but the solid headline payrolls number was accompanied by \"sizeable downward revisions,\" Macquarie said, as jobs gains for the May and April were revised lower. Adding to signs of cooling labor market the the unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, from 4.0% in May, average hourly wage growth slowed, strengthening the case for a September rate cut.\n\n\"While for now our base case for a first cut remains December, it has become increasingly likely that one may occur earlier than this, with a reduction at the September meeting a strong possibility,\" Macquarie added.\n\nTraders now see a 70% of a rate cut in September, down from 60% in the prior week, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Too.\n\nThis cooling in the jobs market through June also comes after a series of weaker-than-expected labor market readings this week.\n\nMeta hits all time highs as tech adds to gians; Nvidia stumbles on downgrade, Tesla in China win\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) led the rise in big tech as the social media company soared more than 4% to hit record highs earlier in the day, with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also higher.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down 2%, failed to partake in the broader market rally after New Street Research downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing concerns about valuations.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock added 2% on reports that several state-owned firms in China's financial hub of Shanghai have recently purchased the EV manufacturer's best-selling Model Y as service cars after Tesla cars reportedly were added to the list Chinese local government purchase list.\n\nMacy's in fresh deal fever; Chinese EV stocks hit by new EU tarrifs\n\nMacy\u2019s (NYSE:M) stock rose over 9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management have raised their bid to buy the department store chain for about $6.9 billion.\n\nChinese EV stocks including Li Auto Inc (NASDAQ:LI), Nio Inc Class A ADR (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng Inc (NYSE:XPEV) were sharplly lower after the European Union proposed increased tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China commended on Friday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto stocks recover ground as Bitcoin pares some losses amid Mt. Gox supply wave fears\n\nCryptocurrency stocks including MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) ended the day off their lowest level after Bitcoin eased losses following a dip below $54,000 even as Mt. Gox exchange, which declared bankruptcy in 2014 after falling victim to a heist that saw it lose 950,000 bitcoin, said it had started making payments in both bitcoin and bitcoin cash to creditors. Many are worried that creditors will sell their bitcoin -- now valued at much than it was in 2014, given BTC's astronomical rise since then -- and force prices lower.\n\n(Peter Nurse, Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Uncovering cheap stocks amid the noise of overvalued and overhyped stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is essential in today\u2019s volatile stock market. Three undervalued AI stocks are set up for significant growth in this case. With innovation, profitability, and astute market positioning, each business offers investors a distinctive opportunity inside the semiconductor and technology industries. Starting with the first one, well-known for producing cutting-edge processors that power consumer electronics and data centers, one can understand why the stocks stand out. The next, known for its expertise in data analytics, keeps surprising with its growing commercial presence and profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, the last company on the list is causing a stir with its revenue growth in semiconductor manufacturing solutions. With that, there are improvements in operational efficiency. Investigating these three businesses is crucial for investors hoping to profit from equities with solid fundamentals and room to develop. Every company strongly argues for being included in a diverse portfolio aimed at long-term growth. In short, they have supremacy in processor technology, solid business strategy in data analytics, or calculated expansion in the semiconductor markets.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Close up of AMD sign in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads the design and manufacturing of semiconductor and AI products. Indeed, the company\u2019s client business has driven solid growth. This\u00a0is because of the high demand and decisive performance of AMD\u2019s Ryzen 8000 series CPUs. For Q1 2024, the division had sales of $1.4 billion, signifying an 85% year-over-year (YOY) growth. The strong sales of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs led to this growth. There is a solid growth potency, as these chips are embedded in devices from major original equipment manufacturers like HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, AMD\u2019s sharp boost in the client market\u00a0is mainly based\u00a0on how its product line incorporates AI capabilities. This strategic integration aligns with the expected expansion of AI in the PC industry. AMD believes that this signals a major turning point. AMD may thrive and expand in the AI PC market because of its partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more than 150 independent software vendors (ISVs) to create AI apps for Ryzen CPUs.\n\nOverall, AMD is on the undervalued AI stocks list due to its strong market position in the client segment and vital strategic partnerships.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) provides data integration and analytics software solutions for government agencies and commercial enterprises. The company\u2019s top line was $634 million in Q1 2024, representing a 21% YOY gain. Strong momentum in its government and commercial areas propelled this expansion. In Q12024, Palantir\u2019s adjusted operating margin increased to 36%, demonstrating the robust unit economics of its business strategy. This margin improvement and sales growth helped the company achieve a Rule of 40 score of 57%. This\u00a0indicates a solid balance between profitability and revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, Palantir\u2019s US commercial business had a solid growth rate. In Q1 2024, revenue from the US commercial division increased by 40% YOY to\u00a0$150 million. Several factors helped to fuel this expansion. These are significant increases in the number of customers (69% YOY) and Total Contract Value (TCV), with $286 million booked in Q1 (a 131% YOY gain). The company can grow its current clientele and draw in new ones. This\u00a0demonstrates the versatility and potency of its offerings, such as the AI Platform (AIP).\n\nTo sum up, Palantir is on the undervalued AI stock list for its constant profitability and expanding customer base.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) provides equipment and services for semiconductor manufacturers. To begin with, in Q1 2024, the company\u2019s top line from single wafer cleaning increased to $109.5 million. There has been a massive 199% gain against Q1 2023. With that, ACM\u2019s operating margin increased to 26.2% from 14.7% in Q1 2023. This enhancement\u00a0is based\u00a0on operational leverage, economies of scale, and efficient cost management over operations. As a proportion of sales, total operating expenditures dropped from 41.9% to 35.4%, indicating increased operational efficiency.\n\nFurther, ACM has\u00a0a CapEx\u00a0of $25.4 million for Q1 and an estimated\u00a0$100 million for 2024. This\u00a0demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on growing its facilities, especially in Lingang, Shanghai. The company is also improving its operating capacities in\u00a0important\u00a0markets such as the US and Korea. ACM\u2019s expanding worldwide footprint\u00a0is reflected in its strong acceptance and favorable feedback from foreign markets, including the US, Europe, and Asia, and its\u00a0important\u00a0ties with major semiconductor manufacturers in China, Korea, and other countries.\n\nFinally, ACM Research was included in the undervalued AI stocks list due to its rapid revenue growth and strategic\u00a0expansion\u00a0in\u00a0key\u00a0global markets.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, PLTR and ACMR.

        "title": "2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett took a cue from a classic Western film last year when he expanded on the idea of the FAANG stocks, dubbing his new set of the most important companies on Wall Street the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These commanding megacaps are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nAll of them remain dominant forces in today's market -- other than Tesla, which is struggling with slowing EV sales. Two of them in particular look like top-tier buys preparing to crush the market right now: Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nGenerative AI is a new tool for each company\n\nWhile both Alphabet and Meta are involved in artificial intelligence (AI), their businesses are far more diverse than that. AI may grab headlines, but the bigger business for both companies is the advertisements they serve up along with the content and search results their users are after.\n\nIn Q1, 77% of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising-related sources. For Meta, an incredible 98% came from ad revenue. This makes the advertising market a key factor in both stocks' investment cases.\n\nFurthermore, each is developing AI technologies to stay at the top of their game. In both cases, that means using generative AI models they have developed in-house to aid advertisers. For example, advertisers on Meta can use its tools to create multiple iterations of the same ad nearly instantly, which allows them to tailor their ads to their viewers. Alphabet offers tools that help advertisers quickly create campaigns that meet all of its internal guidelines. These examples show how each company is trying to stay ahead of its rivals by integrating new AI technologies as quickly as possible.\n\nThese innovations may (or may not) bring any new revenue, as the AI upgrades are essentially required for them to stay at the top of their respective industries. However, each company is doing so well right now that new revenue from new technologies isn't necessarily required for them to excel.\n\nGrowth for each business is strong\n\nIn Q1, Alphabet's ad revenue rose 13% to $61.7 billion. In particular, YouTube excelled, with revenue rising 21% to $8.1 billion. While most of Alphabet's advertising empire is fairly mature, YouTube is still growing quickly. Still, 13% growth companywide is impressive, considering the maturity of the business.\n\nMeta's growth put Alphabet's to shame. In Q1, its ad revenue grew 27% to $35.6 billion. And its revenue increased at a healthy pace in all of its regions worldwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese strong results aren't outliers, either. Wall Street analysts project Alphabet's revenue will rise 13% this year and 11% next year. For Meta, Wall Street expects 18% and 13% growth. Both of these are strong projections (considering the companies' size) and are great reasons to invest.\n\nHowever, the last point is just icing on the cake.\n\nYou don't have to pay a fortune to own either stock\n\nWhen you look at the rest of the Magnificent Seven\u00a0 -- Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla -- every one of them is expensive from a valuation standpoint. Measured by their forward price-to-earnings ratios (which consider earnings projections over the next 12 months), none trades lower than 30.\n\nThat's a historically expensive price to pay, which should give investors pause. However, Alphabet and Meta don't command premiums quite that high. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 24 and 25 times forward earnings, both still command slight premiums to the broader market's average of 22.3 (using the S&P 500 as a benchmark). However, their execution and market dominance justify those slight premiums.\n\nWith both companies excelling, projected to grow at respectable paces, and trading at reasonable valuations, they easily top my list as the best stocks to buy in the Magnificent Seven now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $786,046!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA  XLK, Microsoft and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nNVIDIA Up +147% Year to Date: Too Late to Buy In?\n\nNVIDIA Corporation has experienced an impressive 146.6% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 Generalindustry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF\u2019s gains of 106.3% and 19.1%, respectively. This YTD performance makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company alongside Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., which currently have a valuation of more than $3 trillion.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3.414 trillion as of Jul 2, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world. Apple holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.378 trillion, while NVIDIA is in the third position with a market capitalization of $3.058 trillion.\n\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and autonomous vehicles. Given this remarkable growth, the question arises whether it is too late to buy into NVIDIA or if there is still room for further appreciation.\n\nWhy Could NVDA Stock Further Appreciate?\n\nNVIDIA's remarkable stock performance has been primarily driven by the anticipation that the company will reap substantial benefits from the growing investments in generative AI. Given NVIDIA's leading position in this space and the vast opportunities generative AI presents, the stock seems poised to maintain its upward trajectory throughout the year.\n\nThe increasing demand for workflow modernization across various industries is expected to elevate the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\n\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive expertise for content creation and significant computational power. As a result, enterprises developing generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already widely used in AI models, which is expanding NVIDIA\u2019s presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to drive substantial demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. With the increasing AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $28 billion from $13.51 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNot Too Late to Buy NVDA Stock\n\nNVIDIA's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the shares of NVIDIA are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\n\nThe company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth. NVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth rate of 18.9%. This semiconductor company\u2019s earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 24%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $117.55 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of approximately 93%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.53 per share over the past seven days, which calls for year-over-year growth of 113.4%.\n\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\n\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.01, which is higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s forward P/S multiple of 19.2. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Scoreof A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology.

        "title": "These 5 Stocks Account for 63% of the S&amp;P 500 Returns So Far This Year. Can Their Dominance Continue?",
        "content": "We're officially halfway through 2024, and it's shaping up to be another great year for stock investors.\n\nThe S&P 500 produced a total return of 15.3% through the end of June. That's more than double its historical average for the first half of the year. Its continuous push to new all-time highs bodes well for the second half of the year, too.\n\nIf you look under the hood, the vast majority of the S&P 500's returns have been driven by just five stocks through the first half of 2024. The list isn't too dissimilar from the group of stocks that accounted for the bulk of 2023's return either. If you know about the \"Magnificent Seven,\" you'll be familiar with these names. Can these five continue their dominance through the rest of the year?\n\nThe five stocks accounting for 63% of the S&P 500's returns in 2024\n\nThe S&P 500's aggregate market capitalization increased $5.8 trillion through the first half of 2024.\n\nThe following five stocks generated the biggest market cap increases during the first six months of the year, totaling about 63% of the S&P 500s increase in value for 2024.\n\nStock Market Cap Jan. 1 Market Cap June 28 Increase Increase as a % of S&P 500 Gain Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $1.223 trillion $3.039 trillion $1.816 trillion 31.3% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $2.795 trillion $3.322 trillion $527 billion 9.1% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $1.764 trillion $2.266 trillion $502 billion 8.7% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.57 trillion $2.013 trillion $443 billion 7.6% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) $910 billion $1.279 trillion $369 billion 6.4% Total $8.262 trillion $11.919 trillion $3.663 trillion 63.2%\n\nData source: YCharts.\n\nAll of those companies were already among the largest components of the S&P 500 to start the year. Nvidia's continued dominance of the AI chip market has fueled a massive increase in its stock value. Meanwhile, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are four of the biggest companies investing in developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon also provide the cloud platforms required for training and running AI-powered applications.\n\nThe current trend toward generative AI favors the biggest companies. Building large data centers capable of training large language models and running inferences all day requires a ton of capital. Meta leading the group with its plan to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That's an investment smaller companies can't even start to compete with, especially in today's interest rate environment where debt isn't nearly as cheap as it used to be.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated among just a few companies. Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple account for 20% of the index's value. The next seven components add another 16%. We haven't had this level of concentration among the top-10 companies in the S&P 500 since the 1970s.\n\nWhile there are good reasons for the current level of concentration, investors need to ask if these giant companies can continue to lead the market higher.\n\nWho will lead the next leg up in the market?\n\nRising concentration in the stock market isn't inherently a concern. As mentioned, there are good reasons the biggest companies have gotten bigger. But, investors should remain mindful of valuations and where the market presents good value.\n\nNvidia, for example, trades for a forward PE of around 47. That makes it a risky bet on its continued dominance of the AI chip market. It faces challenges from other chipmakers, and its biggest customers are designing their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Analysts currently expect strong bottom-line growth for Nvidia, but its high valuation makes any shortfall extremely damaging to the share price.\n\nNot every member of the above group is expensive. Meta Platforms and Alphabet trade for forward PEs around 25x. While those valuations are higher than the S&P 500's overall earnings multiple, it's not an outlandish multiple relative to their earnings growth prospects.\n\nLooking beyond the biggest companies may present many more opportunities for investors. The S&P 500 equal-weight index historically outperforms the cap-weighted index over the long run. Smaller companies typically grow faster than the giants at the top of the market. A $1 billion increase in the market cap of a $10 billion company is a 10% increase. The same amount of inflows into a $1 trillion company is a 0.1% increase.\n\nTo make a larger bet on the other 495 companies in the S&P 500, investors could buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(NYSEMKT: RSP). Investors could diversify beyond the S&P 500 using a small-cap ETF, too, such as the iShares Russell 2000 ETF(NYSEMKT: IWM).\n\nWhile the first half saw the continued dominance of a small number of large-cap growth stocks, the next leg up in the market could come from a large number of smaller companies.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts are bullish on the tech sector, predicting a further 15% upside for the Nasdaq in 2024. They believe the current momentum is just the beginning of an AI-driven tech bull market, with the \"AI party\" just reaching 9 pm.\n\nWedbush highlights Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the early leaders of this \"AI Revolution,\" pioneering the foundation for a wave of new applications and spending. They anticipate a \"tidal wave of $1 trillion\" in tech sector spending related to AI over the next 12-18 months.\n\n\"We believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand,\" writes Wedbush.\n\nTheir initial forecast for a 25% growth in tech stocks for 2024 remains on track, fueled by strong performances by tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META). They emphasize this is a new era \u2013 a \"1995 moment\" of technological revolution, not a repeat of the dot-com bubble of 1999.\n\nWedbush expects Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to join the party in the latter half of the year, unleashing the consumer side of the AI revolution. The upcoming iPhone 16 is seen as a potential catalyst for this shift, ushering in an era of AI-powered smartphones.\n\nWedbush predicts a race to a $4 trillion market cap between tech giants Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft over the next year. The firm says Nvidia's dominance in GPU chips, considered the \"new gold\" of the tech sector, positions them well for continued growth as enterprises and consumers embrace the AI revolution.\n\nWedbush concludes that they believe the tech sector is poised for significant growth fueled by the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush sees 15% upside left for Nasdaq, tech stocks\n\nTD's chief compliance officer departs amid US anti-money laundering probe\n\nWorld stocks rise, US yields dip amid jobs data, UK labor landslide\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The best Esports stocks are booming as the sector pounced on robust momentum.\n\nThe sector is hitting its stride again after slumping post-pandemic. During the pandemic years, we saw a massive surge in video game sales. This laid the groundwork for sustained growth in the industry.\n\nHowever, the past couple of years were a struggle for the industry. However, it\u2019s now back to deliver for investors willing to stomach the risk. Moreover, the explosive expansion in viewership and brand interest over the years positions Esports as one of the most lucrative long-term investing trends. \u00a0According to Fortune Business Insights, the esports industry is on track to grow at an annualized 20.9% through 2032. This highlights the sector\u2019s robust long-term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, here are three of the best Esports stocks offering healthy long-term upside potential. These stocks have established their dominance in the sector, and their presence will be felt for years to come.\n\nSony (SONY) Sony logo on the side of a building at its offices in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThrough its strategic alliances and noteworthy investments, Sony (NYSE:SONY)\u00a0has quickly become a force to be reckoned with in the Esports realm.\n\nFor starters, it owns the prestigious Evolution Championship Series (EVO), attracting millions of viewers each year. Moreover, the event allows Sony to leverage its PlayStation consoles and Airpeak drones to deliver a riveting live-stream experience.\n\nMoreover, earlier this year, Sony was announced as a founding partner for the inaugural Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The new, multi-year partnership with the Esports World Cup Foundation is another feather in Sony\u2019s cap as it looks to dominate the Esports scene.\n\nAdditionally, one can\u2019t overlook Sony\u2019s partnership with Esports titan Fnatic, which led to the creation of INZONE gaming gear, including hardware fine-tuned by Fnatic\u2019s top players. These initiatives will continue to enhance Sony\u2019s gaming reputation while driving hardware sales and boosting other business segments.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech behemoth Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has effectively transitioned into a dominant force in the gaming realm through its much-talked-about acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The acquisition indirectly impacts hardware sales, but in Esports, it promises substantial long-term gains.\n\nActivision Blizzard has a massive presence in Esports, running prominent leagues such as Overwatch and Call of Duty Leagues. These leagues effectively tap into high-growth markets while cleverly integrating Esports into broader gaming sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Activision\u2019s layering has had a material impact on Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing division. This is evidenced by its superb results of late, with Q3 sales hitting $15.6 billion, a 17% jump over the prior-year period. Looking ahead to Q4, sales are projected to rise by 10% to 13% in constant currency, potentially reaching $15.6 billion. This growth is fueled by the strategic push into Esports, highlighting Microsoft\u2019s impressive adaptation to market trends.\n\nVanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) VanEck Morningstar SMID Picks\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NASDAQ:ESPO)is a compelling, low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to the burgeoning video gaming and eSports sectors. The EPSO ETF places its bets on the industry giants in game development and related tech verticals. Hence, it effectively captures the essence of gaming enthusiasm and lucrative stakes in top tech fields.\n\nMoreover, with an expense ratio of just 0.59%, ESPO 29 premier stocks in the video game and eSports arenas. Consequently, it has been an excellent wealth compounder, boasting roughly 99% returns over the past five years. In the past year alone, the ESPO ETF has surged upwards of 19.9%,\n\nSome of the stocks it invests in include Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Unity Software (NYSE:U), to name a few. Hence, with video gaming evolving rapidly, ESPO continues expanding its footprint with considerable aplomb.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the\u00a0date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either\u00a0directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Don\u2019t count the metaverse out just yet. While it started as a costly failure, companies are racing to use it, creating opportunities for some of the top metaverse stocks.\n\nFor example,\u00a0McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald\u2019s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nIKEA is launching a virtual universe on\u00a0Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). In fact, its \u201cThe Co-Worker Game\u201d will allow users \u201cto live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) metaverse experience includes virtual roller coasters, mazes and games.\u00a0\u201cBringing Six Flags to Roblox has enabled us to create a one-of-a-kind metaverse experience that will engage and entertain our fans in innovative ways,\u201d said\u00a0Selim Bassoul, CEO of Six Flags.\n\nEven The Rolling Stones are also debuting their music in the metaverse.\n\nBut this is just the start of the metaverse growth story. With demand only set to grow for virtual experiences in entertainment and gaming, analysts at SkyQuest say the metaverse market could be worth nearly $803.3 billion by 2031 from $86.31 billion in 2023.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s time to jump into some of the top metaverse stocks, including:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox.\n\nAfter gapping from about $40 to a low of $30 on poor earnings, Roblox is back to $37.77, where it\u2019s still a buy. Initially, I\u2019m looking for it to refill its bearish gap at $40. Longer term, I\u2019d like to see the stock rally back to at least $45 on improving earnings.\n\nHelping, recent earnings negativity appears to have been priced into the rebounding stock.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, analysts are bullish. Macquarie, for example, just initiated coverage of RBLX with an outperform rating, noting it\u2019s one of the main \u201cbuilding blox\u201d of the metaverse.\n\n\u201cIn our view, there is still a long runway for growth ahead, driven by user growth, better monetization, international penetration and a new advertising initiative,\u201d they added, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nMoffett Nathanson also upgraded the stock to a neutral rating with a $26 price target following the massive sell off in the stock.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is also a buy on weakness.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been driven by artificial intelligence, demand for its chips, and strong earnings growth, it\u2019s also exposed to the metaverse with its Omniverse software.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/foxconn-digital-twin-ai/\n\nWith it, companies can create and test virtual environments all in real time. Foxconn, for example, is using the Omniverse to create a digital twin of its\u00a0new factory in Guadalajara to train robots in a virtual environment.\n\nEven more impressive, according to VentureBeat.com:\n\n\u201cSuch twins enable a company to design a factory in digital form through Omniverse simulations anchored by Nvidia\u2019s chips. The engineers designing the factory can get feedback from the simulation about how good the design is. Once it is perfected, they can build the factory in the real world. And with sensors on the factory, they can get digital information about how good the design really is and then modify the digital design in a feedback loop for continuous improvement.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes shares of Nvidia even more attractive following its 10:1 split.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) A character inside a virtual world.

        "title": "SPYI ETF: Get Paid Every Month, Enjoy the Massive Yield",
        "content": "What\u2019s better than getting paid a dividend every quarter? How about getting paid one every month? That\u2019s exactly what the NEOS S&P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) has to offer investors, and it also comes with a massive dividend yield.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on this new monthly dividend ETF from NEOS based on this attractive payout schedule and its show-stopping 11.6% dividend yield, which is an incredible nine times higher than the yield of the S&P 500 (SPX).\n\nWhat Is the SPYI ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to fund sponsor NEOS, SPYI \u201cseeks to distribute high monthly income generated from investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 Index and implementing a data-driven call option strategy.\u201d\n\nThe fund \u201cutilizes a call option strategy that may include both sold and purchased SPX index options, which may provide the opportunity for upside capture in rising equity markets.\u201d\n\nEssentially, SPYI owns the stocks in the S&P 500. It then generates monthly income for its holders through both the dividend payments from these stocks and by selling call options on the S&P 500 to generate additional income via the premiums from these options contracts.\n\nWhile this generates a high level of monthly income, investors should also note that by utilizing this strategy, they are potentially sacrificing some level of upside from capital appreciation. If SPYI\u2019s holding rises above the strike price for the covered call contracts it sells to generate this income, SPYI will forgo much of this additional upside.\n\nYou can see this dynamic in play by looking at the ETF\u2019s results. For example, in 2023, SPYI generated a total return (which includes price appreciation and dividends) of 18.1% for the year. While this was a strong return, it underperformed the S&P 500\u2019s return of 26.3% for the year.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that SPYI does a bit differently from other ETFs employing this covered call strategy. Rather than investing all of the money it receives from selling call contracts, it has the option to reinvest some of the proceeds back into buying cheaper, further out of the money call options, allowing it to participate in some of this upside if the underlying holding goes beyond the strike price.\n\nAs NEOS explains in the fund\u2019s summary prospectus, the fund seeks to use the S&P 500 call options \u201cto generate a net-credit, meaning that the premium received from the sale of the call options will be greater than the cost of buying the long, out-of-the-money SPX call options.\u201d\n\nIncredible Dividend\n\nWhile the strategy is complex and has some pros and cons regarding capital appreciation and total return, there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s a powerful way to generate significant income. This is evidenced by SPYI\u2019s mouth-watering 11.6% dividend yield, which is about nine times higher than that of the S&P 500 (currently yielding just 1.3%).\n\nStory continues\n\nNot only that, but SPYI\u2019s yield is easily more than double the 4.35% yield offered by 10-year treasury bonds, making SPYI a compelling income investment no matter what type of interest rate environment we find ourselves in.\n\nETFs employing this strategy have grown in popularity in recent years, and it\u2019s worth noting that SPYI also features a higher yield than many of these. For example, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the largest and most well-known of these ETFs, features a 7.4% yield, and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) yields 8.8%. These are both impressive yields, but SPYI\u2019s is significantly higher.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the level of SPYI\u2019s dividend payout is not set in stone, and the amount can vary from month to month. However, the payouts have been relatively consistent, ranging between $0.47 and $0.50 per month over the past year. Additionally, since its launch in August of 2022, SPYI has paid distributions every month, so it is beginning to build up a strong track record of monthly dividend payments.\n\nSPYI\u2019s Holdings\n\nSPYI offers strong diversification, with 508 holdings. Its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 38% of the fund.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of SPYI\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nGiven the fund\u2019s strategy of investing in the constituents of the S&P 500 index, its top holdings unsurprisingly largely mirror those of the broad market index. Its holdings include household names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nSteep Expense Ratio\n\nOne negative aspect of SPYI is that it features a fairly high expense ratio of 0.68%. This means that an investor in the fund will pay $68 on a $10,000 investment over the course of the year.\u00a0Assuming that the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this current expense ratio, this investor will pay $379 in fees over a five-year time horizon, a fairly steep total.\n\nThat said, this is a complex, actively-managed ETF, so it is understandable that it has a higher expense ratio than the typical index fund. As long as the ETF keeps paying out large dividends like clockwork each month, most holders will feel comfortable with the above-average expense ratio.\n\nIs SPYI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, SPYI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 403 Buys, 93 Holds, and nine Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPYI stock price target of $55.24 implies 9.06% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Strong Option for Income Investors\n\nInvestors should be aware that investing in call options ETFs like SPYI might limit potential capital appreciation. However, with a remarkable yield of 11.6%, it\u2019s hard not to like this ETF anyway. I\u2019m bullish on SPYI as a great option for income investors based on its attractive monthly payout schedule and its massive 11.6% dividend yield. As one part of a balanced portfolio, this is an effective tool for generating frequent, above-average income on a steady basis.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "28% Off All-Time Highs, Is AMD Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "While AI leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported stellar Q1 earnings, computer processor and graphics card maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) relatively underperformed, only meeting expectations. This led to a decline in the stock price, post-earnings. However, investors must note that NVDA is a few quarters ahead of AMD. AMD is showcasing impressive growth in its AI-driven Data Center revenues, which will ultimately flow into margins and profits. Therefore, I am bullish on AMD stock.\n\nAMD\u2019s Muted Q1 Earnings Failed to Impress Investors\n\nOn April 30, AMD reported Q1 EPS of $0.62, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. The figure came in a mere 3.33% higher than the Q1FY23 figure of $0.60 per share. Q1 revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year to $5.47 billion, also roughly in line with consensus estimates. Robust Data Center segment revenues somewhat offset the weakness in the Embedded and Gaming segments, but the overall Q1 results were lackluster.\n\nCrucially, Data Center revenue growth continued to impress, growing an impressive 80% year-over-year during the quarter, driven by the launch of its latest MI300 AI accelerators, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. Disappointingly, however, Gaming revenue fell 48% year-over-year due to a decline in gaming chip sales. Further, adjusted gross and operating margins were uninspiring, standing at 52% (78.4% for Nvidia) and 21%, respectively.\n\nNext, AMD\u2019s revenue guidance met street expectations. For Q2, total revenue is expected to be around $5.7 billion (+/- $300 million). Positively, however, management raised the outlook for data center GPU sales, which are now expected to come in at $4 billion versus $3.5 billion guided earlier. The firm\u2019s adjusted gross margin is forecast to be approximately 53%.\n\nAMD\u2019s AI Product Roadmap Presents Strong Growth Potential\n\nA relatively underwhelming Q1 print and fears of AI demand waning have led to a 28% decline in AMD\u2019s stock from its all-time high of $227 in March 2024 to around $164 currently.\n\nHowever, investors should note that AMD is the closest competitor to NVDA. It is well known that AMD\u2019s GPUs are a cheaper alternative to NVDA\u2019s GPUs. Given the clear gap between demand and supply due to limited manufacturing capacity, the surge in the popularity of AI creates an opportunity for AMD chips to fill in the gap.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced that its cloud computing customers using Azure can opt for AMD\u2019s MI300 chips along with NVDA\u2019s H100 GPUs. This will give customers an alternative in case of overall supply constraints or clients\u2019 individual budgetary constraints. Notably, AMD\u2019s MI300 accelerator, which competes with NVDA\u2019s H100 chips, costs 33% less.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia is currently leading in the AI and GPU markets with over 80% market share, AMD\u2019s competitive pricing and performance improvements could help it gain market share over time. It is worth noting that MI300 is reckoned as the fastest-ramping product in the history of AMD. Launched just two quarters ago, it has already crossed the $1 billion sales milestone.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that AMD\u2019s management has been consistently increasing the outlook for MI300 sales for the past three quarters. There is a strong likelihood that the sales increase trend will continue for the upcoming quarters as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that AMD has a wider variety of offerings compared to NVDA. While NVDA is well-known for its powerful GPUs for data centers, AMD caters to a wider range that includes CPUs for PCs and GPUs for the gaming industry. During COVID-19, the PC market saw roaring demand. Now, it\u2019s time again for users to move to new PCs with upgraded technology. AMD is a key supplier to the high-end PC market and is bound to benefit from the uptick in demand for PCs.\n\nFurther, both NVDA and AMD continue to unveil their newest products, including accelerators and processors. While AMD launched its MI300 accelerators in December 2023, NVDA launched its Blackwell GPUs in March 2024.\n\nIn response to NVDA\u2019s pace of innovation, AMD\u2019s CEO Lisa Su also announced an annual cadence of new product launches at the Computex show held on June 2. The product roadmap looked impressive with newer launches year-on-year expected to incrementally add to revenues and profits.\n\nNotably, AMD has consistently undertaken acquisitions to enhance its data center offerings. For instance, it acquired Xilinx in February 2022 and Pensando Systems in May 2022.\u00a0Moreover, the acquisitions have not yet been integrated to their full potential and are expected to yield a $10 billion cross-selling opportunity, as cited by management. With its acquisitions, its total addressable market continues to grow, having increased to $300 billion currently from just under $80 billion in FY2020.\n\nAMD\u2019s Valuation Is Not Cheap but Still Appears Reasonable\n\nSurprisingly, AMD is trading at a high forward P/E multiple (47x), slightly higher than the AI prodigy Nvidia, which is trading at a forward P/E of 45x. What could be the reason for AMD\u2019s high valuation despite lagging behind NVDA\u2019s inspiring results? The answer is clear: AMD will likely follow in NVDA\u2019s footsteps in the next few years, as its AI growth story is just beginning.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider whether it\u2019s worth buying AMD at current levels. Wall Street analysts expect AMD\u2019s EPS to be approximately\u00a0$5.59 in FY2025 (with expectations of around $6.50 in FY2026). If AMD keeps the same forward P/E multiple of 47x by then, its share price will be about $275, or 68% higher than the current price.\n\nPutting it differently, AMD shares are trading at a P/E of 28x its FY2025 EPS estimate, implying a 35% discount to its five-year historical average of 43x.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to consider buying AMD stock at current levels, given the strong growth fundamentals in the AI space.\n\nIs Advanced Micro Devices Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe sentiment among Wall Street analysts is decidedly positive regarding Advanced Micro Devices stock. The stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating, with 28 Buy recommendations and seven Holds.\u00a0AMD stock\u2019s average price target of $191.03 implies 16.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider AMD for the Long-Term AI Potential\n\nThere is a clear-cut demand for AI across a broad range of industries as companies look to build their own data center infrastructure. This implies that strong growth in sales for AI chips, GPUs, and CPUs will continue for at least some years. AMD\u2019s advancements in AI and data center solutions position the company well for future growth, and its competitive pricing will help it gain market share over time.\n\nFurthermore, AMD has a strong foothold in the AI market for PCs and will likely continue to win market share. The impending PC upgrade cycle with AI-enabled PCs will add to sales and margin growth for AMD in the coming quarters. Given my bullish stance, I view the current share price weakness as a buying opportunity.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Dow Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "The Dow 30 is an index of 30 prominent companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow). The Dow is price-weighted, so it generally includes\u00a0companies with large market capitalizations. That said, long-term investors tend to own one or more Dow stocks for long-term growth.\n\nThrough a combination of stock price appreciation and dividend growth, many of these stocks carry the label of \u201cforever stocks.\u201d\u00a0That term was made famous by Warren Buffett who has said that forever is his preferred length of time to own a stock.\n\nLook, there will be books and documentaries made about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). It\u2019s been a wonderfully profitable stock for buy-and-hold investors. And it still has years of growth ahead. But is it a stock that will still be delivering market-beating returns for your grandchildren? It\u2019s too early to tell. However, the three stocks listed here have a long track record that should let you pass on a legacy of growth for future generations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne quality that investors look for in potential forever stocks is their ability to grow earnings. In the case of Visa (NYSE:V), the growth stems from its business model. As the world\u2019s largest payment processor, it simply makes money on the transactions we make every day. And as Nabeel Bukhari recently noted, the company is carving out space in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nThis has allowed the company to deliver earnings growth of 17%, 27% and 17% in the past three years. And it\u2019s on track for 13%, 12%, and 14% growth in the next three years.\n\nNot only has this allowed V stock to climb over 57% in the last three years, but it\u2019s allowed for a three-year annualized dividend growth of more than 15%. This is what compounding is all about and it\u2019s why Visa is one of the Dow stocks for long-term growth.\n\nVisa is currently trading for about 27x forward earnings. That\u2019s a little pricey, but considering the growth it delivers, it\u2019s a premium you\u2019ll be happy to pay.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nThrough its substantial investment in OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sprung to a lead in embedding generative AI throughout its multi-layered ecosystem. Not surprisingly, MSFT stock is up 33.5% in the last 12 months and is part of the group of Magnificent 7 stocks that have been lifting the market.\n\nBut the beauty of owning MSFT stock as one of the Dow stocks for long-term growth is the idea that AI is acting as the cherry on top of the company\u2019s growth story. But it\u2019s far from the whole sundae.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough its Windows operating system, Microsoft has the dominant market in desktop systems that also provides an avenue for its Microsoft 365 productivity tools. Plus, its Azure platform allows Microsoft to be a significant player in the cloud computing sector.

DNA stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock / PopTika\n\nThe story of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) as one of the Dow stocks for long-term growth starts in 2009. Not surprisingly, that\u2019s when the United States started its transition to universal health care. Since that point, UNH stock has achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.18%. And in the next 12 months, analysts expect the company to generate 12% earnings growth.\n\nIn 2024, the aging of America is a major catalyst for UnitedHealth Group. An increasing number of Medicare patients are now in Medicare Advantage plans. And at the end of 2023, UnitedHealth had nearly 30% market share of this market. There is a debate to be had about the effectiveness of Medicare Advantage plans. This isn\u2019t the place for that.\n\nThis is about stocks that offer investors a chance for multi-generational growth. Keep it simple. Healthcare is one of those sectors that will always be relevant, and UnitedHealth will continue to be one of the leading names in that sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Xbox recently announced that CLeM, the fourth installment of the Psychotic Adventures game saga by Mango Protocol, is set to release on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One on Jul 17.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s development began with Mariona, Mango Protocol\u2019s art director, drawing inspiration from a short stop-motion movie script she wrote in 2006. Influenced by the imagery of KoRn\u2019s Issues, the script featured a captive doll chasing bugs, symbolizing the circle of life.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Mariona, along with Javi, the narrative director, and Jordi, a puzzle designer, revisited and adapted this story, weaving personal themes into the narrative and creating challenging puzzles that reflect the main character\u2019s emotional journey.\r\n\r\nCLeM\u2019s art direction brings to life a new version of the doll from the original storyboard, blending dark, cute and creepy elements. The game offers an immersive puzzlevania experience with room escape vibes, inviting players to uncover the emotional and eerie story behind the ragdoll's creation. Pre-orders are now available, promising a unique and engaging adventure for puzzle enthusiasts and fans of dark narratives.\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUpcoming Games on Xbox to Aid Gaming Revenues\n\nBuilding on the announcement of CLeM, Xbox recently announced a wealth of upcoming titles across various genres, promising excitement for gamers on both Xbox Series X|S and PC platforms. These games are expected to boost gaming revenues in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s fiscal 2024 gaming revenues is pegged at $21.4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 38.8%.\r\n\r\nUpcoming games include iconic franchises like Gears of War: E-Day and Doom: The Dark Ages and highly anticipated new releases, such as Avowed and Perfect Dark. Notable highlights include the return of Indiana Jones in The Great Circle, State of Decay 3's ambitious open-world zombie survival gameplay and the stunning visual experiences promised by titles like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Age of Mythology: Retold.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Xbox also announced three new console options to expand its current lineup, offering enhanced design, storage and price options to better suit gamers' needs. These new consoles are set to launch this holiday season alongside a robust selection of titles available on day one through Xbox Game Pass, further solidifying Xbox's commitment to providing accessible gaming experiences across multiple platforms.\r\n\r\nHowever, Xbox faces tough competition from big giants like Sony SONY, Electronic Arts EA and Nintendo NTDOY\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 22.5% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 26.7%. However, the stock outperformed SONY, which lost 9.5%, followed by EA and NTDOY\u2019s rise of 1.4% and 5.8%, respectively, in the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nXbox\u2019s upcoming games act as a catalyst for the company. However, strong competition remains a concern.\r\n\r\nIn Gaming, the company expects revenue growth in the low-to-mid 40s in the fourth quarter. This includes roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings per share is pegged at $2.9, which has increased a cent in the past 60 days.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has agreed to a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over allegations of discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. This settlement, pending court approval, marks a significant development in workplace rights and corporate accountability.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit, which primarily affected women and disabled employees, alleged that Microsoft penalized workers who took protected leave by giving them lower bonuses and unfavorable performance reviews.\r\n\r\nThe California Civil Rights Department's three-year investigation uncovered a workplace culture that reportedly discouraged employees from using protected leave, with managers allegedly making negative comments about such absences.\r\n\r\nAs part of the settlement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has committed to implementing several measures to prevent future employment abuses. These include retaining an independent consultant to review and recommend improvements to the company's practices for annual rewards and promotions, ensuring employees\u2019 awareness of how to raise discrimination complaints and reporting findings to the California Civil Rights Department. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe $14.4 million settlement fund will be primarily distributed among affected Microsoft employees who worked for the company in California between May 2017 and the court's final judgment date. A small portion of the settlement will support the agency's enforcement efforts.\r\n\r\nThe case underscores the importance of proactive measures to ensure equal treatment of all employees, particularly those requiring protected leave for personal or family reasons.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, while agreeing to the settlement, maintains that the allegations are inaccurate, stating its commitment to providing an environment that supports employees' need for leave.\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMSFT Grapples With Legal Challenges Amid Broader Tech Industry Scrutiny\n\nAs Microsoft navigates these legal hurdles, the California settlement serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges tech companies face in balancing rapid growth and innovation with fair and inclusive workplace practices.\r\n\r\nThis case is part of a broader trend of increased scrutiny of tech companies' employment practices. Recently, California's civil rights agency settled a $15 million sex-based discrimination lawsuit against Snap Inc. SNAP and a $54 million discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft acquired in October 2023.\r\n\r\nThe settlement comes at a time when MSFT is facing legal challenges on multiple fronts. The company is currently embroiled in a copyright infringement lawsuit related to its investment in OpenAI, and it faces potential antitrust fines from the European Commission for bundling its Teams application with other business software. (Read More: Microsoft Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office)\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Apple AAPL is confronting multiple regulatory challenges in the EU, including its first charges under the new Digital Markets Act for allegedly preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. Meanwhile, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google is under investigation for potential non-compliance with the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing, underscoring the EU's heightened scrutiny of major tech companies' practices.\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have gained 22.1% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 26.7%, 14.4% and 32.6%, respectively. Shares of Snap have lost 4% in the same time period.\r\n\r\nAs these firms continue to innovate and grow, they face increasing pressure to ensure fair competition, protect user rights and maintain equitable workplace practices. The outcomes of these legal challenges may set important precedents for the future of the tech industry, potentially reshaping how these companies operate and interact with their employees, customers and competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The AI sector has significantly boosted the tech industry, attracting investors with innovative technology advancements promising substantial returns. Stocks linked to generative AI have surged, potentially marking the start of a significant industry uptrend.\n\nInvesting in AI stocks remains viable despite recent surges. Spending on AI tech is projected to skyrocket, offering ample growth opportunities for new entrants in the market. For example, analysts fond of AI are now looking beyond giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThese three undervalued AI stocks I\u2019m about to discuss boast strong growth, key tech partnerships, and strategic acquisitions. Such factors place them in a unique position for tech sector prominence and potential high returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest and top-performing AI stock striding alongside Nvidia, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an AI stock to buy and hold. In 2023, the company\u2019s sales rose 37%. Forecasts suggest future revenue increases could come in around 110%, with earnings likely to surge more than 100% in 2024.SMCI holds a significant 10% share in the AI server market, poised to potentially increase to 17% as the market expands by 150%, per Bank of America.\n\nSuper Micro recently experienced a significant pullback after a volatile period in March and April, despite its remarkable rise of over 1,800% over the past two years. This downturn, though alarming to recent investors, might present an opportunity rather than a catastrophic decline. Concerns over AI demand and stock valuation drove some to sell, yet the fundamentals suggest potential for recovery.\n\nWith ongoing strong demand expected in AI, Super Micro\u2019s unique technologies like liquid cooling and modular server design could bolster its position in the data center market.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

These factors have allowed the company to see $35.1 billion in revenue in Q3 2024 alone. Analysts rate this stock as a strong buy with 11% upside, reflecting consistent market outperformance and a robust financial performance trend.\n\nRecently, IAS and Microsoft extended their partnership from 2020, focusing on post-bid brand safety, view-ability, and traffic measurement in Microsoft\u2019s ad tools. This allows advertisers to verify engagement and media quality using IAS metrics alongside Microsoft\u2019s audience data.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft also recently announced its 2024 Partner of the Year Awards, recognizing global contributions from its partners. Selected from 4,700 nominations across 115 countries, winners were celebrated across various industries. Nicole Dezen, Microsoft\u2019s chief partner officer, highlighted the record-breaking submissions, emphasizing collaboration\u2019s strength and community growth.\n\nOther category winners included EY, JourneyTeam, PwC, Lenovo, and Nvidia, with Dell Technologies, Elastic, KPMG, RSM, Softchoice, and Version 1 as runners-up. Nicole Dezen emphasized the awards\u2019 prestige, celebrating partners\u2019 exceptional contributions and impactful innovations in business transformation and social impact.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nCurrently expanding drastically in global data center footprint, Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL)\u00a0 is one of the most promising AI companies to consider. With its strong financial standing, Oracle aims to capitalize more on the AI trend and plans to power its data centers with renewable energy in 2025. The company\u2019s impressive commitment to invest in its AI capabilities certainly places Oracle at the center of this discussion. At least, that\u2019s my view.\n\nOn June 27, ORCL saw double-digit gains after its Q4 earnings report. Although results came in below expectations, investors believe that the company\u2019s forward guidance will propel new cloud partnerships with big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft. Oracle also expects strong demand on its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, anticipating strong sales growth in 2025.\n\nMashreq, a top MENA financial institution, extended its Oracle Financial Services partnership to boost global expansion. The agreement involves upgrading core banking systems for enhanced operations in global hubs like Hong Kong, the U.S., and the UK. Mashreq also plans greenfield digital banks in Pakistan and Oman, integrating Oracle solutions for operational efficiency and compliance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Most top-tier blue-chip and long-term investment opportunities, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are already well-known and heavily purchased.\n\nHowever, as concerns grow about the concentration of investments in a few mega-cap stocks, demand for breakout stocks is increasing. These breakout stocks may not remain so for long and will instead likely turn into the next big media story of runaway growth and strong upward momentum.\n\nDespite the current economic uncertainty, some promising breakout stocks offer a blend of growth, stability, and income. These stocks span various market caps and sectors and could provide significant returns and diversify your portfolio. While no investment comes without risk, these under-the-radar breakout stocks have strong potential to become standout performers in the years ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAtlanta Braves Holdings\u00a0(BATRA) Atlanta Braves stadium\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a billionaire to own a stake in a sports team. By investing in breakout stock Atlanta Braves Holdings (NASDAQ:BATRA), you can claim a slice of this iconic Georgian sports franchise. Listed in July 2023, this stock provides investors access to the Braves\u2019 sales revenue and income from the associated real estate assets within the Braves ecosystem.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for high-profile endorsements, just look at some of the company\u2019s major shareholders. Among the backers of Atlanta Braves Holdings is Warren Buffett, who holds a position in this firm as part of his broader investment in SiriusXM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI). The Braves\u2019 former owner, Liberty Media (NASDAQ:LSXMA), is currently in a high-profile merger with SiriusXM. Buffett\u2019s interest in this unique investment ecosystem is a strong endorsement. Additionally, legendary value investor Mario Gabelli is a fan of the stock, predicting that shares could reach $55 in the coming years.\n\nDespite overall market challenges, Atlanta Braves Holdings stands out as a potential home run for investors seeking unique opportunities in the sports and entertainment sectors.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands out as more than just a unique breakout stock \u2014 it represents a gateway into the burgeoning trillion-dollar space industry. Last year, Rocket Lab gained significant attention with a record-setting number of launches. This year, the company continues to impress with a substantial government contract worth over $500 million and a strong earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab\u2019s current launch and contract backlog exceeds $1 billion, providing a promising forecast for potential revenue, even though clients may cancel. With first-quarter revenue hitting $92.7 million, this backlog indicates considerable growth opportunities.\n\nFurther cementing its position in the global space sector, Rocket Lab recently secured a deal with Japanese company Synspective for 10 Electron launches through 2027. This partnership highlights Synspective\u2019s trust in Rocket Lab\u2019s capabilities as a space-based operator and delivery system for its satellites. While the financial terms were not disclosed, the agreement underscores Rocket Lab\u2019s growing role in the space industry, making it a breakout stock with substantial future potential.\n\nGetty Images\u00a0(GETY) Image of Getty Image logo on gray background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/360b\n\nGetty Images (NYSE:GETY) is an often overlooked breakout stock with significant potential, especially given its unique position in the artificial intelligence sector. Known for its extensive library of stock photos and journalism photography, Getty serves many clients, including creatives, media companies and corporate marketing teams. However, what truly sets Getty apart is its innovative collaboration with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), making it an intriguing AI stock to watch.\n\nEarlier this year, Getty introduced a generative AI image creator powered by Nvidia. This tool simplifies creating customized images for professionals and amateurs, offering a more user-friendly experience than other platforms like Midjourney\u2019s Discord-based service. More importantly to publishers, Getty\u2019s tool also includes robust legal protections for users, addressing growing concerns about copyright issues in AI, as evidenced by ongoing legal battles involving companies like OpenAI.\n\nDespite a slight decline in sales and income in its latest earnings report, Getty saw a significant rise in subscription rates, which now make up 55.4% of its net revenue. This growing subscription base will expand further as Getty\u2019s AI-driven services become more widely adopted. This positions Getty Images as an undervalued stock with promising AI potential, making it a strong candidate among low-priced stocks with upside.\n\nParsons (PSN) Veterans Day. US soldiers. US army.

This strategic positioning at the intersection of precision and cost-effectiveness places Photronics at the forefront of current and emerging technologies, making it a compelling pick among under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nValued at just 12x earnings, Photronics offers an attractive entry point for investors. Its steady income stream reflects solid financial health, and despite being relatively young in the semiconductor industry, the company is poised to benefit significantly from the expanding use of semiconductors across various sectors.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The fa\u00e7ade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in fairly speculative investments, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) is a unique breakout penny stock trading around $3.50 per share with a market cap of approximately $110 million. Despite its small size, this company is positioned at the cutting edge of emerging e-commerce trends that could significantly impact the market in the coming years.\n\nPSQ Holdings\u2019 flagship platform is the digital marketplace PublicSquare, which emphasizes helping consumers \u201cshop their values\u201d by aligning purchases with personal beliefs and ethics. While the company\u2019s conservative ethos might initially stand out, the broader concept behind PublicSquare transcends political affiliations. The platform taps into a growing desire among consumers to support businesses that reflect their values and principles.\n\nIn today\u2019s fragmented social media landscape, people often find themselves within like-minded networks or echo chambers. This trend extends to shopping habits, with a rising preference for e-commerce platforms that align with personal values. PublicSquare meets this demand by offering American-made goods, starkly contrasting the declining quality of many overseas products found on giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) consistently makes my list of breakout stocks, and for good reason. The Japanese company exemplifies a business model that stands apart from many American public companies. Instead of focusing on short-term gains, Nintendo takes a long-term approach, prioritizing sustainable growth over immediate profits. This strategy, perhaps, is why Nintendo has been a resilient player in the market since its founding in 1889 as a playing card company.\n\nA look at Nintendo\u2019s balance sheet underscores its commitment to long-term stability. The company maintains a robust cash reserve and carries no debt, providing a solid financial foundation to navigate economic fluctuations and seize new opportunities. This financial strength is so compelling that Microsoft considered acquiring Nintendo in 2020, recognizing its value as a prime low-priced stock with significant potential. Although the acquisition didn\u2019t materialize, Microsoft\u2019s interest highlights Nintendo\u2019s enduring appeal in the market.\n\nRecently, Nintendo has also capitalized on its extensive intellectual property, opening new revenue streams that further enhance its position as a smart investment. The company\u2019s prudent financial management and innovative approach ensure it remains a standout in the gaming industry, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking both value and growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Upgrade or Downgrade? Wall Street Just Changed Its Mind on These 3 Stocks.",
        "content": "Following analyst upgrades, downgrades or initiating coverage reports can be exhausting. Wall Street is constantly raising, lowering or reiterating their position on a stock, sometimes changing a price target by just a few cents or dollars.\n\nYet knowing where analysts think a stock is headed can still be useful. After all, they do have access to management that is unavailable to the average investor. They can gain greater insight into whether a business will grow or contract. That should be reflected in their ratings.\n\nThat\u2019s why stocks with changed analyst ratings should warrant closer attention by investors. All three companies below were recently upgraded or had coverage initiated on them with a buy rating. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper into the stocks to see if they are right for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T (T) AT&T Retail cell phone and mobility store. T stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTelecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T) just had coverage initiated on it by Goldman Sachs with a buy rating. Analyst Jeremy Schneider assigned a $22 per share price target on the stock, which is inline with the $21.73 per share consensus view. Wall Street as a whole has a moderate buy rating on the telecom.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Ma Bell sets well with analysts. Its first-quarter results in April showed near-record low wireless customer churn, or the number of customers who left the carrier. AT&T says it had an industry-leading postpaid phone churn rate of 0.72% for the period. In comparison, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) had 0.86% churn while Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported 0.89% churn.\n\nAT&T said it added fewer net postpaid wireless phone customers during the quarter, or 349,000, versus 424,000 a year ago. Cost-cutting measures and fewer phone upgrades helped raise operating margins by 30 basis points (bps) to 23.4%.\n\nMoreover, it reduced its network investments, which yielded improved free cash flow (FCF) of $3.2 billion. That is a $2.1 billion increase year-over-year (YOY). It expects to generate between $17 billion and $18 billion in FCF in 2024, which will support its dividend that yields a very attractive 6% annually.\n\nAT&T stock is up 12% in 2024 and 18% over the past year. Trading at under $19 a share, Goldman Sach\u2019s price target implies additional 17% upside in the stock.\n\nAmerican Tower (AMT) American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 Schneider also initiated coverage on American Tower (NYSE:AMT) with a buy rating and a $230 per share price target.\n\nThe specialty real estate investment trust (REIT) owns cellular towers around the world and leases them to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, and others under long-term leases. Although the industry fell out of favor due to carrier consolidation, the future looks particularly promising considering the continued growth in demand for mobile data.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, American Tower might have lopped off its own knees by selling its tower business in India, a market with tremendous growth potential. It also entered the data center market and owns 28 facilities. Yet, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a significant connection between its primary tower business and data centers. So, it may prove to be a fruitless venture.\n\nStill, AMT\u2019s tower business is growing. It reported same-tower sales growth of 5% in the first quarter and its ability to impose annual price increases helped expand EBITDA margins by 160 bps to 65.4%. That should continue to improve in the quarters ahead.\n\nLike all REITs, American Tower is required to pay out 90% or more of its profits as dividends. And, it has raised its payout by more than 16% a year for the past decade. Growing FCF at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% over that period, it has plenty of cash profits to support the payout, which yields 3.4% annually.\n\nThe analyst\u2019s price target implies 19% upside in the stock, making American Tower stock worth considering for your portfolio.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSpeaking of data centers, the largest data center owner with over 300 locations is Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR), which is also organized as a REIT. Schneider was active here as well, initiating coverage with another buy rating and a $175 per share one-year price target. The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) has made data centers mission-critical and positions Digital Realty Trust at the epicenter of the technology.\n\nAI drove the REIT\u2019s massive bookings in the quarter, which Digital Realty says will contribute some $252 million in annualized GAAP rental revenue. That was 40% more than its previous record. Hyper-scalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have an insatiable need for more capacity. DLR said data center deployments for such customers amounted to $175 million in annualized revenue.\n\nAlso, the REIT was able to increase rental rates on renewal leases by nearly 12% as a result. Yet there is simply so much AI demand that the REIT likely won\u2019t have the capacity to meet it all. Right now, though, Digital Realty Trust is taking on as much as can be thrown its way. It reported earnings of 82 cents per share, a blistering beat ahead of Wall Street\u2019s expectations of just 24 cents.\n\nSchneider\u2019s price target implies 15% upside in the stock, but it could easily blow through that level. The stock is up 33% over the last 12 months. Additionally, Digital Realty pays a dividend yielding 3.3% annually.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in T stock.

        "title": "Intel Stock Analysis: A High-Stakes AI Bet That\u2019s Already Priced In",
        "content": "At first glance, it seems reasonable to expect Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock to rally this year since it manufactures AI chips like the ARC A770, A750, and A580 lineups priced at an attractive range.\n\nHowever, the stock is down 38% year-to-date in a year that tech stocks are rallying. Intel\u2019s valuation is still high despite U.S. government support, weak finances, and declining market share in key areas.\n\nGovernmental Funding and Intel Stock\n\nThe U.S. government would like Intel to remain a strong player in the semiconductor industry compared to other emerging Chinese companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn March 2024, Intel announced its plans with the U.S. government under the CHIPS Act, which proposed more than $100 billion in the U.S. semiconductor chip industry over the next five years and $8.5 billion directly to Intel.\n\nTo better understand the funding scale, Intel had less than $2 billion in net income last year. One of the key ways Intel plans to use this funding is to develop its AI capabilities.\n\nThat means this funding can help it catch up to competitors in AI chips, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nU.S. politicians seem to believe in this, too. In May 2024, Congressman Michael McCaul purchased Intel stock worth an estimated $250,000 to $500,000.\n\nFurthermore, he is the co-chair and Founder of the Congressional High Tech Caucus and helped write the CHIPs Act. His purchase is a bullish sign that this program could significantly help Intel.\n\nLosing Market Share\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I don\u2019t want to gamble on Intel is that it has lost its market share in its core market with no indication of a comeback. Its market share in desktop CPUs declined again in 2024, with 76.1% versus 80.8% in quarter 1 of 2023, as it continues to lose to AMD.\n\nIn addition, it lost out to ARM (NASDAQ:ARM), when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s computers stopped using Intel in 2020. The same is happening with some PC laptops and Chromebooks as well.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) new PCs, which will have AI functions heavily implemented natively, are set to mainly deliver with ARM-based chips because of their power efficiency while beating out Intel\u2019s speed.\n\nValuation Isn\u2019t Justified\n\nAs a result of its failure to catch up with the rest of the market, Intel\u2019s revenue has tanked. The chart below shows its revenue at $12.72 billion in the latest quarter, which has fallen off a cliff compared to when Intel would make north of $20 billion a quarter.\n\nFor a company that is seeing its revenue decline, its valuation only shot up. It\u2019s currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 32.3x, more than double the amount it was trading in 2022 and likely due to the AI craze.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as of 2024, it still only has 1% of the market share of AI chips, which has not meaningfully increased.\n\nThe company is being traded almost like a growth stock, while revenue growth has thus been negative, and its AI efforts show no signs of success.\n\nMy Verdict\n\nAI is a catalyst for Intel, and maybe the federal government\u2019s money could help it penetrate the AI chip market to warrant its current valuation, which is double before the AI craze 2022.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t want to take this bet because it is losing customers in its core segment of desktop CPUs while its AI efforts have been mediocre.\n\nI might\u2019ve considered Intel if its valuation keeps coming down, but for now, buying into Intel is a pure gamble on AI that is already exceptionally priced, as seen in its jump in P/E.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 28% in constant currency of which 6% was Al related versus 3% last quarter. Further, management noted most of the Al revenue was from inference rather than training indicating high quality Al applications by Microsoft's clients. Management also indicated that significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America have begun to trail off. suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure's growth are abating.

        "title": "2 Elite Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Buying and holding shares of growing companies is a straightforward path to building wealth in the stock market. Here are two elite leaders in the technology sector that can help you grow your portfolio over the next 10 years.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) market cap has tripled over the last 12 months as cloud service providers snap up the company's highest-end chips to train and power artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nNvidia was founded in 1993 and created its first graphics processing unit (GPU) in 1999. Through the early 2000s, Nvidia's GPUs became a preferred hardware choice for people who wanted to play video games on PCs, but in the last decade, the company found a new set of buyers for these chips -- the data center market, which is now its largest business.\n\nThe data center segment now generates 86% of Nvidia's revenue, but it's got a long runway for growth ahead. There is an estimated $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that is in the process of transitioning from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs for AI, which could lift Nvidia shares to new highs.\n\nOver the next few years, Nvidia should continue to see strong demand for its hardware to train large language models for generative AI applications. Around two-thirds of organizations are using generative AI, up from one-third a year ago, according to McKinsey. This is driving more investment in AI infrastructure, as was reflected in the 427% year-over-year increase in Nvidia's data center revenue last quarter.\n\nWith more companies preparing to launch generative AI apps, the data center infrastructure required to support them will continue to grow. This will be a huge benefit for Nvidia, which controls an estimated 70% or more of the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia has dominated the GPU market for many years, but its opportunity in AI is still in its early innings, and could still deliver outstanding returns for patient investors.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nTech giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) also has the wind in its sails right now. It has successfully leveraged its investment in generative AI developer OpenAI to unleash new features across its products to drive demand. AI-powered features in Windows, Office, and Bing search are opening new revenue opportunities for the software leader, and it's just getting started.\n\nThe stock has hit new highs this year as Microsoft continues to report solid financial results. Revenue grew 17% year over year in its most recently reported fiscal quarter, driven by balanced growth across productivity software, cloud services, Windows, search, advertising, and gaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has been investing heavily in its AI infrastructure technology, and it's paying off. Two-thirds of the Fortune 500 are using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI cloud services. Its Intelligent Cloud business was its fastest-growing segment last quarter, with revenue up 21% year over year.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot is also proving to be a game changer for working professionals. That AI-powered assistant -- available on Windows, Office, and other products -- is a huge opportunity for Microsoft to continue growing its software business. For example, 88% of software developers that have used GitHub Copilot say they are more productive after using it.\n\nThe best thing about Microsoft is that it can deliver these innovative software tools and still produce growing profits to fuel returns to shareholders. Earnings per share grew by 20% year over year in its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, and the consensus estimates on Wall Street are that its earnings will keep growing at double-digit percentage annual rates over the long term.\n\nWhen an already-dominant company like Microsoft can still deliver market-beating returns, its stock should be a no-brainer choice for growth investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The studio behind one of the world\u2019s best-selling video games is seeking new revenue streams beyond gamers as growth in the sector slows.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Struggles to Contain Mounting Pressure to Drop Out of Race House Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels China Can End Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says US Allies Say China Is Developing Attack Drones for Russia\n\nMinecraft maker Mojang Studios is exploring partnerships in areas such as merchandising, education and content-streaming, according to its chief \u00c5sa Bredin. That\u2019s in addition to a Warner Bros.-distributed movie adaptation, scheduled to premiere in April, and a Netflix series that\u2019s also in the works.\n\nFans of the 15-year-old franchise include those who don\u2019t play the game but \u201creally want to be part of this whole thing that is Minecraft,\u201d Bredin said in an interview in Tokyo on Thursday. \u201cWithin our portfolio of experiences, we want to be able to cater to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Corp.-owned Mojang has built Minecraft from a one-person project into a global service with well over 100 million active users each month. Revenue in the studio\u2019s consumer products business, ranging from clothing to plushy toys in claw machines, has doubled over the last two years, she said.\n\nMojang\u2019s push follows repeated forays by Nintendo Co. and Sony Group Corp. to broaden the appeal of their gaming properties at a time that spending in the industry has hit a lull. Nintendo is developing a live-action film based on the Legend of Zelda franchise, following the blockbuster success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, while Sony has turned The Last of Us into an HBO series and created games based on the Spider-Man movies.\n\nThe rare Western game that\u2019s gone mainstream in Japan, Minecraft is one of the most popular titles among the country\u2019s elementary school children, with Minecraft YouTubers such as HikakinGames clocking up millions of views.\n\nIn contrast, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox game console has struggled to gain traction in the world\u2019s No. 3 gaming market. Last year, Microsoft hired a PlayStation veteran to win market share in Sony and Nintendo\u2019s home turf.\n\nMojang has adopted artificial intelligence to help moderate chats and content in a game that\u2019s played by different age groups, Bredin said. But it remains to be seen what the broader impact of AI will be on the industry, she added.\n\nAI is upending the $200 billion games industry, displacing some programmers and designers while forcing executives to study machine learning. That\u2019s on the heels of a wave of job cuts, even at OpenAI-backer Microsoft, which laid off 1,900 people across its video-game divisions earlier this year.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe believe in AI, and I think for the long term, we will see a lot in this space,\u201d Bredin said, adding that game-building will continue to be an art that requires creativity. \u201cWhile AI is built into the tools, we really believe in the talent.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Shery Ahn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This AI Story Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stories.\n\nAre Growing Patents in AI from China a Threat to the US?\n\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\n\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\n\nOpenAI & Anthropic: A Comparative Analysis\n\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\n\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\n\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\n\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks second on our list of the best AI stories from this week. The technology company owns multiple platforms backed by artificial intelligence including Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Power platform, and Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also reducing its reliance on AI hardware companies to produce efficient infrastructure systems for its AI products. Last year, the company introduced tailored AI chips including the Microsoft Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Microsoft Azure Cobalt CPU. The Maia AI Accelerator is optimized to run artificial intelligence tasks and generative AI. The Cobalt CPU, on the other hand, is capable of running general-purpose compute workloads on the Microsoft Cloud.\n\nOverall, Microsoft Cloud reported $35 billion in revenue, up 35% year-over-year. Like Amazon, Microsoft is also big on forging partnerships with groundbreaking startups. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Mistral AI, an artificial intelligence company based in France. Mistral AI is capable of bridging communication gaps across different languages. Under the partnership, Mistral AI will gain access to Azure's AI infrastructure to help them develop the next generation of large language models.\n\nThe company's efforts in AI do not end here. Two weeks ago, on June 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its efforts to empower scientists with AI-augmented scientific discoveries at companies like Unilever. Its Azure Quantum Elements platform is a groundbreaking addition to Microsoft's suite of AI products. The platform offers two distinct capabilities including Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DTF. The platform is capable of exploring novel molecular structures at groundbreaking speed and scale. Moreover, it can also dissect and simulate chemical and molecular structures. The platform will be able to expedite chemical research, compressing 250 years of research to only 25.\n\n293 investors were bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $88.16 billion. Among them, Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest stakeholder with a position worth $15.36 billion. Wall Street is bullish on the stock.\n\nOn June 21, Citigroup maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target from $495 to $520.\n\nHere are some comments about MSFT from Mar Vista Investment Partners' Q1 investor letter:\n\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.\n\nMicrosoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\"\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 154\n\nSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a prominent AI story and a leading cloud provider, contributing to its ranking on our list. The cloud provider is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. The company's AI cloud platform can support any large language model and is built on the Einstein GPT Trust Layer. Key AI products by the company include Sales AI, Customer Service AI, Marketing AI, and Commerce AI. In a recent development, MuleSoft, Salesforce's software company that provides integration software to connect data and applications, launched AsyncAPI which is capable of building AI-powered customer experiences in real-time. The launch will facilitate the widespread adoption of event-driven architectures, allowing businesses to respond to real-time events faster.\n\nOverall, the company is now responsible for 250 petabytes of data for its customers, crucial to the AI transition. The company's Data Cloud is rapidly growing to become its next $1 billion cloud. Data Cloud streamlines AI insights and actions for its customers. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) claims that this is its first step to becoming an AI enterprise and is expecting a major tailwind in revenue due to AI adoption.\n\nOverall, at the close of Q1 2024, 154 investors were bullish on the stock, with total stakes amounting to $16.62 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $3.27 billion.\n\nCRM is a Wall Street favorite. Its median price forecast represents an upside of 15% from current levels.\n\nHere are some comments about Salesforce from Harding Loevner's Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Leading software companies have the advantage of high switching costs and the ability to incorporate new features into products customers already use. For example, Microsoft has added its Copilot chatbot functionality to everything from search (Bing Chat, recently renamed to just Copilot) to coding (GitHub Copilot) and workplace applications (Copilot for Microsoft 365). Software sold by Microsoft and other companies such as Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), SAP, and ServiceNow are also already deeply integrated into their customers\u2019 operations and workflow.\n\nAs large enterprises search for the right balance, Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud, a flagship offering, is designed to address a critical issue for them so they can make better use of AI tools. After a hectic buildout over the last few years of \u201cdata warehouses\u201d and \u201cdata lakes\u201d\u2014two types of repositories for storing and processing data\u2014across the various business units of large companies, many companies are left with what feels like islands of trapped data. Data Cloud solves this by creating a single platform to access and leverage all of an enterprise\u2019s data, eliminating the need to constantly duplicate large amounts of information across different platforms. Users are then able to apply generative-AI technology, such as Salesforce\u2019s Einstein tool, to a more comprehensive dataset, which enables them to better glean customers\u2019 intentions, personalize marketing messages, and automate the processing of customer-service requests. As users build these systems, Einstein\u2019s copiloting functionality helps their programmers work more efficiently so that IT departments with limited budgets and manpower can still develop the necessary tools.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Department of Veterans Affairs and an arm of the US State Department are among a growing list of Microsoft Corp. customers that have acknowledged they were impacted by a breach of the technology giant that was blamed on Russian state-sponsored hackers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Struggles to Contain Mounting Pressure to Drop Out of Race House Democrats Consider Demanding Biden Withdraw From Race China Can End Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine With One Phone Call, Finland Says US Allies Say China Is Developing Attack Drones for Russia Kamala Harris Is Having a Surprise Resurgence as Biden\u2019s Campaign Unravels\n\nThe US Agency for Global Media, part of the State Department that provides news and information in countries where the press is restricted, was notified \u201ca couple months ago\u201d by Microsoft that some of its data may have been stolen, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. No security or personally identifiable sensitive data was compromised, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe agency is working closely with the Department of Homeland Security on the incident, the spokesperson said, declining to answer additional questions. A State Department spokesperson said, \u201cWe are aware that Microsoft is reaching out to agencies, both affected and unaffected, in the spirit of transparency.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft disclosed in January that a Russian hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard had accessed corporate email accounts and later warned that they were attempting to use secrets shared between the technology giant and its customers. The company has declined to identify the customers who were impacted.\n\n\u201cAs our investigation continues, we have been reaching out to customers to notify them if they had corresponded with a Microsoft corporate email account that was accessed,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said on Wednesday. \u201cWe will continue to coordinate, support and assist our customers in taking mitigating measures.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Department of Veterans Affairs was notified in March that it was impacted the Microsoft breach, officials for the agency said.\n\nThe hackers used a single set of stolen credentials \u2014 found in the emails they accessed \u2014 to break into a test environment in the VA\u2019s Microsoft Cloud account around January, the officials said, adding that the intrusion lasted for one second. Midnight Blizzard likely intended to check if the credentials were valid, presumably with the larger intention of breaching the VA\u2019s network, the officials said.\n\nThe agency changed the exposed credentials, along with log-in details across their Microsoft environments, once they were notified of the intrusion, they said. After reviewing the emails that the hackers accessed, the VA determined that no additional credentials or sensitive email was taken, the officials said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerrence Hayes, the VA\u2019s press secretary, said an investigation is continuing to determine any additional impact.\n\nThe Peace Corps was also contacted by Microsoft and notified about the Midnight Blizzard breach, according to a statement from its press office. \u201cBased on this notification, Peace Corps technical staff were able to mitigate the vulnerability,\u201d according to the agency. The Peace Corps declined further comment.\n\nBloomberg News asked other federal agencies for comment, and none of the others disclosed that they were impacted by Midnight Blizzard\u2019s attack on Microsoft. Bloomberg previously reported that more than a dozen Texas state agencies and public universities were exposed by the Russian hack.\n\nMidnight Blizzard, also known in cybersecurity circles as \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cAPT29,\u201d is part of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, according to US and UK authorities.\n\nIn April, US federal agencies were ordered to analyze emails, reset compromise passwords and work to secure Microsoft cloud accounts amid fears that Midnight Blizzard may have accessed correspondence. Microsoft has been notifying some customers in the months since then that their emails with the tech giant were accessed by the Russian hackers.\n\nThe Midnight Blizzard breach was one in a series of high-profile and damaging security failures at the Redmond, Washington-based technology company, which has drawn strong condemnation by the US government. Microsoft President Brad Smith appeared before Congress last month where he acknowledged security failures and vowed to improve the company\u2019s operations.\n\n(Updates with no additional comment from Peace Corps in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before For Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

An outside consultant will monitor and report on the company's compliance.\n\nMost of the settlement money \u2014 $14.2 million \u2014 will go toward harmed workers. Covered employees worked at Microsoft from May 13, 2017, to a yet-to-be-determined date of court approval for the settlement, and who took at least one leave protected under state or federal law.\n\nEach eligible employee will receive a base payment of $1,500 with more available based on factors such as salary and length of employment.\n\nMicrosoft has about 221,000 employees worldwide, including nearly 7,000 in California, according to the state civil rights agency. The agency did not have an estimate for how many workers could receive payment.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp has agreed to pay $14 million to settle a California agency's claims that it illegally penalized workers who took medical or family-care leave, the agency said on Wednesday.\n\nThe California Civil Rights Department in filings in state court accused the tech giant of retaliating against its California-based employees who used parental, disability, pregnancy and family-care leave since 2017 by denying them raises, promotions and stock awards.\n\nThose workers, who were disproportionately women and people with disabilities, received lower performance-review scores that in turn suppressed their pay and opportunities for promotions and altered their career trajectory, the department said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe settlement, which must be approved by a state judge, would resolve a multiyear investigation by the Civil Rights Department, the agency said.\n\nMicrosoft denied wrongdoing in the settlement agreement. In a statement, a company spokesperson said it disagreed with the agency's allegations.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft is committed to an environment that empowers our employees to take leave when needed and provides the flexibility and support necessary for them to thrive professionally and personally,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe state's Civil Rights Department has announced a series of large settlements in recent years, mainly in sex-discrimination cases. Those include a $100 million deal with videogame maker Riot Games in 2021, a $54 million settlement with Activision Blizzard last year, and, last month, a $15 million settlement with Snapchat parent Snap.\n\nThe agency accused Microsoft of sex and disability discrimination and interfering with workers' rights to take leave.\n\nIt was not clear how many workers could benefit from the settlement. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has about 6,700 employees in California, according to court filings.\n\nKevin Kish, the director of the Civil Rights Department, said in a statement that Microsoft failed to support workers when they needed time to care for themselves and their families.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The settlement announced today will provide direct relief to impacted workers and safeguard against future discrimination at the company,\" Kish said.\n\nAlong with the $14.4 million payout, Microsoft has agreed to hire an independent consultant to ensure that company policies do not discriminate against workers who take leave and that employees are able to raise complaints, and to provide training to managers and human-resources personnel.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "title": "Microsoft reaches settlement with California over alleged employee discrimination",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) has reached a $14.4 million settlement with California\u2019s Civil Rights Department over claims the company discriminated against employees who were on parental and disability leave.\n\nThe department announced today that the settlement, which is subject to court approval, means Microsoft has pledged to take numerous steps to prevent future employment abuses.\n\n\u201cBy allegedly penalizing employees for taking protected forms of leave, Microsoft failed to support workers when they needed to care for themselves or their families,\u201d Kevin Kish, director of California\u2019s Civil Rights Department, said in a statement. \u201cThe settlement announced today will provide direct relief to impacted workers and safeguard against future discrimination at the company.\u201d\n\nThe complaint said most of those affected have been women and disabled employees. It alleges that employees who used protected leave were given lower bonuses and unfavorable performance reviews.\n\nThe agency said that Microsoft \u201cfailed to take sufficient action to prevent discrimination from occurring, altering the career trajectory of women, people with disabilities and other employees who worked at the company, ultimately leaving them behind.\u201d\n\nAccording to legal filings, a three-year investigation by the agency found \u201cmanagers have commented negatively on employees\u2019 use of protected leave\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s workplace culture discourages employees from using protected leave.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. In the court filings, the company denied the claims made in the action. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella speaks at the company's annual developer conference in Seattle, Washington, U.S., May 21, 2024. REUTERS/Max Cherney (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe complaints said impacted employees have suffered economic injuries such as lost earnings, lost future employment opportunities, plus other non-economic damages.\n\nImpacted Microsoft workers employed between May 2017 to when the court enters the judgment will be eligible for compensation from a $14.2 million settlement fund. The remainder of the settlement will go toward the agency\u2019s enforcement efforts.\n\nThe software giant, headquartered in Redmond, Wash., employs 6,700 workers in California and approximately 221,000 worldwide. As a leader in the artificial intelligence boom, its stock has jumped roughly 35% in the past year.\n\nUnder the proposed settlement, Microsoft will retain an independent consultant to make recommendations about the company\u2019s practices for workers' annual rewards and promotions. It'll also ensure its employees know how to raise complaints about discrimination. The company will be required to report its findings to the department.\n\nStory continues\n\nCalifornia\u2019s civil rights agency is cracking down on Big Tech. Last month it settled a $15 million sex-based discrimination lawsuit against Snap (SNAP). The social media company denied the allegations in the suit but said it agreed to settle to avoid a legal battle.\n\nLast December, a historic $54 million settlement was announced in a years-long discrimination lawsuit against video gaming firm Activision Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft that October.\n\nAt the time, Activision said in a statement: \"We appreciate the importance of the issues addressed in this agreement and we are dedicated to fully implementing all the new obligations we have assumed as part of it.\"\n\nMicrosoft is facing legal challenges on other fronts. Last week, the company and OpenAI were sued in Manhattan\u2019s federal court by the Center for Investigative Reporting over alleged copyright infringement. The nonprofit newsroom raised concerns over Microsoft\u2019s significant investment in the ChatGPT maker.\n\nMicrosoft is also facing a steep fine after the European Commission, the European Union's antitrust authority, announced last month that the company breached antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other applications for businesses. The company could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith said in a statement, \"having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission's remaining concerns.\"\n\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "OpenAI\u2019s reported decision to let Apple sit in on its board meetings is very revealing",
        "content": "After last year\u2019s brief, chaotic ouster of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI reformed its board and key partner Microsoft got a seat as a non-voting observer. Microsoft had been blindsided by the Altman episode, which had been set in motion by the old board, and this was a way of ensuring it wouldn\u2019t get any further nasty surprises from the company into which it had invested $13 billion.\n\nBut now, according to Bloomberg, another non-voting observer is coming: Apple, as represented by App Store chief Phil Schiller. Apple hasn\u2019t invested anything into OpenAI, but it is integrating OpenAI's models into its devices (for free) and Schiller's role is reportedly part of that agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how the situation may become awkward, as Microsoft and Apple are longstanding rivals that will soon both be using OpenAI\u2019s models to power AI assistants on their competing products. Even by the excessively cozy standards of the U.S. AI sector, this may be too close for comfort. There will have to be a lot of recusing going on during certain board discussions, and that might not be enough to make this work.\n\nBut even without considering the potential for future disputes too deeply, there\u2019s quite a lot to digest about the immediate implications of letting Apple observe OpenAI's board meetings.\n\nThe first and most obvious point is that both parties in the Microsoft-OpenAI love-in are increasingly hedging their bets. It\u2019s been clear for a while that Microsoft is doing this\u2014unsurprisingly, given last year\u2019s turmoil. It absorbed key staff from the AI startup Inflection in March and is now reportedly developing a GPT-rivaling AI model of its own, with Inflection cofounder Mustafa Suleyman leading the effort.\n\nRecently, there have also been hints of OpenAI asserting its own independence in the relationship. The Information reported last week that OpenAI is now making more revenue from directly selling access to its models than Microsoft is making doing the same thing. Building ChatGPT into MacBooks and iPhones is also a big deal, but giving Apple an observer role would confirm that OpenAI and Microsoft are not as tightly intertwined as once seemed the case.\n\nConversely, the reported development also suggests that Apple may not be hedging its bets as much as it appeared to be doing just a few weeks ago.\n\nIt didn\u2019t bring Altman on stage for the announcement of the Apple-OpenAI partnership\u2014he was in the audience\u2014and reporting since then has suggested that Apple may yet also incorporate Google and Anthropic\u2019s AI models into its platforms, as alternatives to OpenAI's ChatGPT. But unless it also plans to take observer roles on each of those companies\u2019 boards, Apple seems set to give OpenAI and its technology an elevated status for a long while yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis may also say something about Apple\u2019s progress in developing its own top-tier AI models, which should obviate the need for any such partnerships\u2014when they appear, and if they prove competitive.\n\nI asked all three companies for comment, but none has been forthcoming. More news below\u2014and see you on Friday, as Data Sheet will be taking tomorrow off for the U.S. holiday.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Insiders At Microsoft Sold US$82m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "In the last year, many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Microsoft\n\nThe President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$459. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.7% of Bradford Smith's holding.\n\nMicrosoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nMicrosoft Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Microsoft. In total, Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff sold US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Microsoft Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Microsoft insiders own about US$1.1b worth of shares (which is 0.03% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Microsoft Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider hasn't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Microsoft has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 3, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Oracle Corp. ORCL, T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS, and EVI Industries, Inc. EVI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Oracle and T-Mobile\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and T-Mobile US, Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock EVI Industries, Inc.. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+21.4% vs. +15.1%), reflecting continued gains from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+36.1% vs. +15.1%). The company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results benefited from the steady adoption of strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and OCI, as well as a recovery in cloud revenue growth.\r\n\r\nIts Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence (AI) clientele because of better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL's continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the uncertain economy and competition in the cloud computing market weighed on demand for its cloud offerings. Stiff competition in the cloud market is slowing down the growth of its expansion efforts in the competitive market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nT-Mobile shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+11.6% vs. +11.1%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. The acquisition of U.S. Cellular's wireless operation will enable TMUS to expand its fast-growing home broadband offerings and fixed wireless products by tapping into the additional capacity and coverage.\r\n\r\nLong-term contracts with the U.S. Navy will likely boost commercial prospects. Lower operating expenses are boosting its margin. Solid growth in free cash flow underscores efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives.\r\n\r\nHowever, the highly competitive and saturated U.S. telecom market affects its growth potential. Promotional offers and low-priced service plans to expand the customer base are putting pressure on its profitability. Soft demand for prepaid services is a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of EVI have underperformed the Zacks Industrial Services industry over the past year (-17.5% vs. -10.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $224.96 million is facing challenges which include declining profitability, higher operating costs and interest expenses, competitive pressures, and environmental regulations, impacting margins and growth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, EVI is well-positioned in the growing dry-cleaning and laundry services market, benefiting from urbanization, increasing disposable incomes, and demand from the hotel sector. EVI's revenues reached $263.4 million in the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, driven by price increases to counter rising costs, improving gross profit margins to 29.6%.\r\n\r\nThe \"buy-and-build\" strategy, exemplified by acquiring ALCO Washer Center, enhances market presence and service capabilities. EVI maintains a strong balance sheet, reducing long-term debt to $21.9 million and a current ratio of 1.53. Innovations in smart-laundry solutions cater to environmental and convenience demands.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on EVI here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) the Best Stock Pick of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stock Picks of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire\u00a0Leon Cooperman predicted in April that the US is headed for a financial crisis. Cooperman said that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, but raised them dramatically in a period of 12 months. The \u00a0Omega Family Office chairman and CEO expects \u201cone or two\u201d rate cuts this year. He emphasized that the market remains overvalued.\n\nIn February last year, the billionaire said that the market was headed for a recession, and noted that the S&P 500 high of about 4,800 recorded in 2022 could \u201cstand for some time.\u201d In July 2022, while talking to\u00a0Bloomberg, Cooperman said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d that interest rates were so low.\n\n\u201cI am of the view that equities are the best house in the financial asset in the neighborhood, but I don\u2019t like the neighborhood, for a lot of reasons.\u201d\n\nCooperman in the Bloomberg interview in 2022 had categorically said that sooner or later the strong dollar, prices of oil and the Fed would \u201clead us into a recession.\u201d He went on to add that recession would be a \u201c2023 event\u201d and predicted that the market would bottom somewhere near 35% to 45% below its peak of 4800.\n\nThe billionaire had said that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if we were to see another bull market anytime soon, given his view that we\u2019ve had one of the biggest bull runs driven by FAANG, SPACs and speculation. The AI revolution that started in 2023 was indeed a shocker for Cooperman as his recession predictions were proven wrong.\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Leon Cooperman\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best Stock Pick of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024?\n\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nWhile Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the ninth biggest holding of Leon Cooperman, the stock tops our list of the best stocks in Leon Cooperman\u2019s portfolio based on hedge fund sentiment. A total of 302 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working.

        "title": "2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence Stocks with Room to Run",
        "content": "Like it or not, the world is barreling toward a new reality -- one in which artificial intelligence (AI) will play a crucial role in our daily lives, perhaps reshaping the fabric of society in the process.\n\nHow should investors position themselves for this technological inflection point? While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI investing, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) also offer a direct line to this transformative trend. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Microsoft: A top AI infrastructure play\n\nMicrosoft's strategic partnership with OpenAI has positioned the tech behemoth at the epicenter of AI innovation. This collaboration has already yielded significant results, with AI integration enhancing Microsoft's product suite across the board.\n\nDespite an impressive 21% year-to-date increase in share price, Microsoft's stock still appears to have considerable runway ahead. That said, the tech giant's stock currently trades at 34 times forward earnings, a premium valuation that might give some investors pause.\n\nHowever, this premium seems well justified in light of Microsoft's noteworthy top-line growth forecast for 2025. With revenue estimated to rise by 14.3% in 2025, Microsoft is defying the typical slowdown expected of mature tech companies.\n\nIn fact, this double-digit revenue growth rate is nothing short of spectacular for a company with a $3.4 trillion market cap. It's a clear indicator that Microsoft's AI-driven strategy is paying dividends, quite literally.\n\nSpeaking of dividends, income-focused investors shouldn't overlook Microsoft's potential in this area. At first glance, the current yield of 0.66% might seem modest. However, it's the growth rate of this dividend that truly sets Microsoft apart.\n\nOver the past five years, the company has increased its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6%. To put this in perspective, this growth rate outpaces the average 6% growth rate of the world's top 60 dividend growth stocks (author's own data).\n\nThis combination of AI-driven growth and generous dividend increases makes Microsoft a compelling option for a wide range of investors. Growth investors can tap into the potential of AI through a well-established, profitable company.\n\nIncome investors, on the other hand, can benefit from a rapidly growing dividend stream that has the potential to significantly boost total returns over time.\n\n2. TSMC: The foundry at the heart of the AI revolution\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing might not be a household name, but it's the backbone of the AI hardware revolution. As the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC produces the advanced semiconductors that power AI applications for tech giants like Apple and Nvidia.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC's stock has surged 65.7% year to date, but it remains relatively cheap compared to other AI plays, trading at around 27 times forward earnings. For reference, the benchmark S&P 500 trades at approximately 22.6 times earnings.\n\nThis attractive valuation for a core AI stock is largely due to the perceived geopolitical risks associated with Taiwan's complex relationship with China. However, TSMC's wide economic moat, stemming from its dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing and strong relationships with tech leaders Apple and Nvidia, forms a compelling investment case.\n\nMoreover, the company's ongoing geographical diversification, with new facilities being built in Japan and Arizona, is gradually mitigating its geopolitical risk.\n\nFor income-focused investors, TSMC offers a respectable 1.43% dividend yield, adding to its appeal as a value play in the AI space.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The Metaverse is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The metaverse market size is expected to grow to $803.1 billion at a 39.68% CAGR. One of the reasons for this growth is the metaverse\u2019s ability to provide novel, interactive experiences across different industries.\n\nThe U.S. economy is doing well post-pandemic. Policymaker\u2019s big spending approach to the pandemic early has contributed to increasing the deficit and inflation. However, it is also responsible for one of the strongest labor markets we\u2019ve ever seen. As a result, the U.S.A. has outdone its global peers in total labor productivity per employee post-pandemic.\n\nWith a strong U.S. labor market, now is the time to invest in the metaverse. Here are the best metaverse stocks to buy in July.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a software company that develops proprietary 3D modeling services and products.

Revenue has grown 11.66% YOY and its net profit margin has grown 40.11% YOY. The company even shows signs of being undervalued as a current WACC of 9.1% but an ROIC of 13.6% presents an opportunity to gain on investment for investors.\n\nAutodesk has acquired Wonder Dynamics, a company that focuses on 3D cloud animation and VFX solutions through AI-powered tools. These tools lower artists\u2019 workload on Autodesk platforms, allowing them to further their creativity and improve the Autodesk platform experience for artists. Autodesk has also changed its management structure, with previous CFO, Deborah Clifford, stepping down and Elizabeth Rafael being appointed in the interim. This decision came after an internal audit surprisingly discovered that \u201ccertain decisions\u201d concerning discretionary spending and accounts payable resulted in decreased profitability. Autodesk is one of the best metaverse stocks for investors this July.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) A photo of the Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a gray building against a blue sky.\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a company that designs and manufactures semiconductors and wireless technology services.

The company was able to beat EPS and revenue expectations for Q1 2024, making it the third consecutive quarter of EPS and revenue surprises. Free cash flow has grown markedly to an astonishing 377.28% YOY increase, making a case for QCOM\u2019s strong profitability beyond EPS.\n\nStory continues\n\nQCOM furthers its partnership with Meta Platforms (NYSE:META) by optimizing \u201cMeta Llama 3 large language models\u201d significantly on cell phones, VR/AR headsets, PCs and more devices on the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform. This greatly improves the user experience and efficiency of AI applications on Qualcomm devices.\n\nWith regards to the Metaverse, Qualcomm is ramping up development of its new \u201cXR2 gen 3\u201d VR GPU chips. The flagship chip is rumored to be capable of 4k resolution. While the Apple Vision Pro offers this as well, the products with the \u201cXR2 gen 3\u201d could offer similar capabilities at a massively discounted price. Strengthening ties to Meta and the development of a powerful VR chip with market-changing potential make QCOM one of the best metaverse stocks.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) ADBE stock adobe stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a leading software company that specializes in digital media and marketing. The company\u2019s investment into AI features with its strong subscription model has helped with its success.\n\nThe company reported $5.31 billion in revenue in its Q2 earnings call, beating many analysts\u2019 expectations alongside a 10% YOY increase.

        "content": "The growth of artificial intelligence is a rising tide that raises all ships. This is evident when looking at one-year growth of companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), through a historic AI bull run that we are still in. Technology that helps corporations automate and make day-to-day tasks more efficient will be prevalent in the coming years. Just as automated machines took factory workers\u2019 jobs, robots will start to do the same in multiple sectors.\n\nThis is backed by the robotics industry\u2019s compound annual growth rate, which projected to be 18% through 2034. This is indicative of strong growth \u2013 even in companies that don\u2019t match the industry average.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three robotics stocks that will give you favorable returns in the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is not the first thing that comes to mind when you think robotics stocks. The company is a globally renown EV manufacturer. But Tesla is expanding into the robotics sector through products such as Robotaxi and Optimus (Tesla Bot). However, Tesla\u2019s core EV business is currently struggling, representing a risk investors should factor in.\n\nTesla\u2019s financials are pretty good; it has a profit margin of 14.3%, an operating cash flow of $10.98 billion, and an EBITDA of $12.26 billion. However, quarterly revenue is down 8.7% from a year ago, with earnings growth down more than 55%. This is primarily due to delivery expectations falling. EV sales in the second quarter are expected to fall as much 12%. However, other sources suggest that this quarter marks the \u201crebound\u201d with innovations such as Robotaxi carrying the company\u2019s growth.\n\nRobotaxi is Tesla\u2019s spin on the autonomous taxi. CEO Elon Musk has been teasing this for a while, but Robotaxi\u2019s official reveal date has yet to be confirmed. Hinting to its release, the company recently patented a self-cleaning feature for Robotaxi. This shows a step in the right direction. Analysts are projecting this as being a huge catalyst, so it is best to move now and buy TSLA stock.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NYSE:ISRG) is a robotics company that specializes in products used in the healthcare sector. It has seen immense growth over the past year and is up 30% in 2024. Strong revenue and earnings growth make this pick a buy.\n\nISRG currently has a profit margin of 27.1%, with an operating margin of 24.8%. The company has $7.32 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, with quarterly revenue increasing by 11.5% in the last year. Profitability is very strong, with an earnings growth of 53.4% in the same period. The company has $4.8 billion in cash; enabling ISRG to expand its research and development departments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is projecting 16.1% growth over the next five years. This is based on multiple catalysts, including the adoption of its systems and developments in AI, but counterbalanced by supply constraints. The company\u2019s Da Vinci system has grown by 14% from a year ago with utilization up 2%. The increased prevalence of AI in the medical field also boosts ISRG stock. However, supply constraints are leading to ISRG losing sales; any missed sale means that the company misses out on market share. That being said, ISRG is still a solid robotics stocks pick.\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) operates in the autonomous food delivery niche. While it is a newer company, it saw immense publicity over the past few months. SERV is up 1% over the past five days, but is down 92% year-to-date. While this seems to be a negative sign, analysts are projecting an average price target of $46.33, representing a growth potential of over 2,200%.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials aren\u2019t great; the operating margin is a loss of 814.55%, EBITDA is a loss of $21.33 million, and operating cash flow is loss of $16.34 million. This led to the company losing a lot of money \u2013 debt stands at $8.47 million. However, a saving grace is that quarterly revenue is up 2,252%, which is extremely impressive for a company this small.\n\nA leading growth catalyst for SERV is its partnership with industry heavyweights \u2013 this includes Uber (NYSE:UBER), Nvidia, and 7-Eleven. These partnerships have become increasingly useful as they provide SERV with legitimacy and leverage. Recently, SERV announced that it would be expanding operations in Los Angeles, with Uber Eats helping SERV cover areas of Koreatown.\n\nInsiders and institutions control 44.2% of SERV stock, which should make investors confident. This suggests that people believe this company has a ways to go. Thus, it is a great low-cost robotics stock investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With all the artificial intelligence-related (AI) fervor, several tech stocks were offloaded by both retail and institutional investors. These oversold tech stocks then became somewhat overlooked by the majority of media outlets due to their lack of exciting progress toward an AI-centric goal. However, that does not mean they\u2019re bad investments. Rather, they simply are not part of the current success story driving the market.\n\nYet, they may still have genuine potential, and thanks to the increased selling trend, some might argue they are trading at a discount. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss three stocks that some analysts argue are trading at more than a 10% undervaluation compared to their intrinsic value.\n\nIn some cases, this discount can be a result of oversold positions or even overwhelmingly negative media coverage that has driven investors away from the stock. That said, just because a stock is at a discount does not mean it warrants a buy, rather it is a speculation on its potential to someday reach its intrinsic value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHP (HPQ) HP sign with blue sky and autumn leaves as backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of America\u2019s primary laptop, desktop and printer producers HP (NYSE:HPQ) has not received the attention and appreciation commensurate with its financial performance. Up only 13% for the last 12 months, many investors have seemingly shrugged off the 3.15% dividend it offers at an attractive 11.87x price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nOne reason why the company has not garnered as much attention as other personal computer (PC) makers like Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is due to its relatively straightforward approach to AI. That\u2019s because the company has announced a full suite of AI PCs to a relatively unenthused consumer base.\n\nMost Americans are not necessarily lining up to buy a laptop or desktop with AI functionality, particularly when most still don\u2019t have a habit of using it day-to-day. While that might change and propel HP stock upwards, most analysts agree the stock is undervalued as is, with Alpha Spread calculating it is 27% below intrinsic value.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has struggled to get attention over the last two decades since its big selloff following the dot-com crash. That has resulted in it falling among oversold tech stocks. Yet, the company has continued to work hard to stay relevant through experimental AI partnerships and exciting acquisitions.\n\nFrom working with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to improve Webex, to acquiring Splunk, Cisco has begun to raise the question of whether or not it is undervalued. Some analysts argue yes. Taking a quick look at its metrics, the company\u2019s 16x price-to-earnings ratio suggests it is incredibly cheap at the moment. This factor is even more intriguing when compared to the broader tech industry which is full of overvalued stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor CSCO, Alpha Spread calculates a 3% undervaluation from intrinsic value while the Globe Investorcalculates 10%. In any case, I think CSCO has a lot of room left to grow as the tech world continues to rely on its cloud connection services.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nOpinions about Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have ranged from bullish to excessively bearish over the last few months, and it\u2019s the latter opinion that has seen many investors scrambling to offload the stock. Year-to-date, INTC stock has lost over 35% of its value. Part of this has been from abysmal losses related to chip manufacturing scrap rates while another part is due to intense investor selloffs.\n\nAs a result, the stock is trading very close to its 52-week low and could very well be in a great position for a turnaround performance. Here\u2019s why, chipmaking capacity. While Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) may be the current semiconductor industry sweetheart, it cannot manufacture the quantity of semiconductors currently in demand.\n\nAs a result, major fabless chip designers could eventually turn to Intel for fabrication services, which would catapult INTC\u2019s position in the market. It\u2019s hard to say how much lower INTC stock could go before it goes up, but there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s one of the undervalued and oversold tech stocks at this point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy on the Dip in July",
        "content": "Excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) continues to drive the tech sector in 2024. Consequently, it is propelling the Nasdaq Composite index nearly 20% higher to record highs. This surge underscores the adage that \u201cthe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.\u201d This resonates strongly in today\u2019s market, particularly with beaten-down tech stocks to buy.\n\nDespite high valuations driven by investor enthusiasm, savvy investors can still find opportunities in undervalued tech stocks that could like recover soon. Recent declines, whether due to disappointing earnings or perceived overvaluation, have made several tech stocks compelling buys amid broader market optimism. These stocks, often overlooked in the current market frenzy surrounding the leading names in generative AI, may offer significant long-term potential.\n\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s delve into three beaten-down tech stocks poised for a robust recovery in the latter half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) mobile phone screen with Enphase Energy (ENPH) logo on it to represent renewable energy stocks\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal energy technology company Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). As a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, the company sits at the heart of the growing solar energy industry.\n\nIn 2024, Enphase Energy faced challenges from slowing solar projects amid high interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainties. In Q1 of 2024, revenues plunged over 60% year-over-year (YOY) to $263 million, meeting the lower end of guidance. Non-GAAP diluted EPS fell to 35 cents from $1.37 last year, though gross margins improved to 46.2%. The company maintained a solid net cash balance of $1.6 billion versus $1.3 billion in debt.\n\nDespite these current headwinds, the International Energy Agency (IEA) anticipates solar photovoltaic (PV) investments to exceed $500 billion in 2024, outweighing all other energy sources combined. ENPH is seizing these opportunities by expanding internationally, such as introducing its IQ\u00ae Battery 5P\u2122 in Mexico and Canada. Also, it is entering the Finnish solar market and launching its Solargraf software platform in the Netherlands.\n\nMoreover, ENPH stock has declined more than 25% year-to-date (YTD). Yet, it trades at relatively rich valuations of 35.5 times forward earnings and 7.7 times sales. Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic and have set a 12-month median target of $130.00. Such an advance would mean an upside of over 30%, highlighting ENPH as a strong risk-reward opportunity.\n\nFortive (FTV) An image of a hand turning a dial from 'manual' to 'robotic process automation'\n\nSource: Iurii Motov/Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nDiversified industrial company Fortive (NYSE:FTV) specializes in professional instrumentation, automation, sensing and transportation technologies. Fortive operates through three segments of Intelligent Operating Solutions, Precision Technologies and Advanced Healthcare Solutions.\n\nIn the Q1 of 2024, Fortive\u2019s revenues grew 4% YOY to $1.5 billion but missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Adjusted diluted EPS rose 11% YOY to 83 cents. Encouraged by these results, management raised the full-year 2024 earnings forecast, expecting double-digit growth.\n\nFortive\u2019s revenue streams are well-diversified, with half coming from differentiated products. In addition, about a third comes from electrification and AI investments, and the remainder from recurring healthcare consumables and software revenues.\n\nFocusing on growth, Fortive targets sectors like software and data analytics to expand its market presence. Investors are noting the strength in digital solutions and recurring healthcare incomes through Fortive\u2019s software as a service\u00a0(SaaS) offerings.\n\nSince January, FTV stock has declined 2% since January. Currently Fortive shares are valued at 18.5 times forward earnings and 4.3 times sales. Finally, FTV stock remains attractive to analysts, who anticipate a 22% potential upside, with a 12-month median target of $88.63.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for designing and manufacturing essential computing components, ranging from processors to data center solutions.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Intel posted $12.7 billion in revenue. This 9% increase from the previous year\u2019s quarter was driven by double-digit growth in Intel Products. Meanwhile, the foundry division dragged on revenue growth, declining 10% YOY. Adjusted EPS stood at 18 cents, compared to a loss of 4 cents last year.\n\nIn February, Intel strategically split its Product and Foundry divisions to enhance competition. The company is targeting break-even margins for Intel Foundry by 2030, aiming to become the world\u2019s second-largest foundry. With its ambitious five-nodes-in-four-years (5N4Y) plan, many analysts suggest Intel is poised for growth. The upcoming launch of 18A Panther Lake CPUs and partnerships such as with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on AI chips further reinforces its growth trajectory.\n\nIn fact, 2024 hasn\u2019t been good for Intel share shareholders as the stock has lost 38% of its value YTD. Currently, the shares are trading at 24.3 times forward earnings and 2.4 times sales. Wall Street analysts project a 12-month median price of $36.00 for INTC stock, a potential upside of 17%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Cutting-Edge Tech Stocks to Supercharge Your Profits",
        "content": "Fundamentally, the bullish narrative for targeting cutting-edge tech stocks is rather straightforward. Outside of extraordinary circumstances, the innovation ecosystem always attempts to push society forward. Therefore, should you pick viable enterprises, you stand a better chance of accruing significant profits over the long run.\n\nEssentially, the concept undergirding cutting-edge tech stocks is permanently relevant. That doesn\u2019t mean that every idea selected from the broad tech umbrella will perform well. There are zero guarantees in the market and even robust and celebrated enterprises can always fail. That said, the unique backdrop of the current juncture makes individual innovators compelling.\n\nWith the advancement of artificial intelligence and related innovations, a surge of demand has entered the tech environment. Further, the resounding upside of names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have galvanized support among investors. Now, the focus has shifted toward alternative entities that can deliver the goods. On that note, below are cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the biggest names among cutting-edge tech stocks, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plays a key role in multiple arenas. A significant money maker is the company\u2019s Azure platform, which is a leader in cloud-computing services. Further, Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, integrating digital intelligence across its products. It\u2019s also a huge name in the gig economy thanks to its Office 365 suite of business programs.\n\nWhat makes MSFT a particularly powerful player among cutting-edge tech stocks is predictability. Between the second quarter of 2023 and Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average earnings per share hit $2.82. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 7%. Notably, it beat every bottom-line target for each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Microsoft posted net income of $86.18 billion or $11.53 per share. Revenue reached $236.58 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate over 20% expansion in EPS to $11.80. On the top line, they\u2019re targeting 15.6% growth to sales of $244.92 billion.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the top semiconductor manufacturing specialists, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) focuses on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These pieces of equipment are crucial for developing the most advanced computer chips. Essentially, the underlying technology enables operators to print intricate patterns on silicon wafers. Plus, ASML is unique \u2013 it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind enterprise, making it one of the top cutting-edge tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Microsoft, ASML represents a predictable business. That\u2019s no surprise given its unique nature. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of $4.85. This print translated into an average earnings surprise of 8.2%. The company beat bottom-line targets in each of the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, ASML posted net income of $7.11 billion or $19.25 per share. Revenue during the cycle hit $26.1 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts see mixed results, anticipating a slight dip in EPS and a very modest rise in revenue. However, fiscal 2025 could see a 56.5% leap in EPS to $32.21. Sales could soar 32.4% to hit $39.57 billion.\n\nHoneywell (HON) top Tech stocks to watch : Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. tech stocks\n\nSource: Peshkova / Shutterstock\n\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t technically call Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) a pure-play example of cutting-edge tech stocks, the industrial conglomerate does feature a building controls business unit. Under this unit, Honeywell offers charging solutions for electric vehicles. Specifically, it markets its services to commercial real-estate operators looking to integrated EV charging to their properties.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling due to recent deals in the EV space. Basically, more automakers are focusing on securing demand from middle-income customers as opposed to affluent buyers. Well, long story short, a direct correlation exists between income and homeownership. And that means modest-income buyers will likely require public charging solutions. That\u2019s a huge plus for HON stock over the long run.\n\nPlus, Honeywell is a consistent player, beating its bottom-line targets in the past four quarters. Its average earnings surprise came out to 2.85%. For fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for EPS to expand by 12.2% to reach $10.28. On the top line, they anticipate sales to rise by 5.6% to hit $38.7 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s not much growth but Honeywell also offers a forward yield of 2.02%.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) An image of a white, grey, and orange sign with the \"Intuitive Surgical\" logo and number \"1020\" on a patch of grass in front of a white, grey, and orange building on a sunny day.\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother name that\u2019s not quite a pure-play candidate for cutting-edge tech stocks, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) nevertheless deserves some consideration. Yes, it\u2019s more aligned with the healthcare sector. Intuitive develops and manufactures robotic products for minimally invasive surgeries. Ultimately, the underlying innovation should help improve patient outcomes. And that down the line benefits the broader economy.\n\nIndeed, society suffers when individuals \u2013 especially highly skilled and educated workers \u2013 must exit the assembly line (for lack of a better phrase) to take care of their health needs. So, minimizing the downtime is beneficial for the patient and society\u2019s bottom line. It\u2019s no surprise that Intuitive has been a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, its average EPS came out to nearly $1.50.\n\nFor the above print, the average earnings surprise was 6.2%. In the TTM period, Intuitive posted net income of $1.99 billion or $5.52 per share. Revenue reached $7.32 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for 10% EPS expansion to $6.29. On the top line, sales could hit $8.02 billion, up 12.6% from last year.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top names in cybersecurity, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is vital to the wider economy. That\u2019s an easy statement to make because so much of business is conducted online and through cloud networks. It\u2019s critical to provide next-generation endpoint protection, which is CrowdStrike\u2019s specialty. It also offers threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting.\n\nWhile enterprises may be looking for costs to cut, cybersecurity may survive the budgeting axe. That\u2019s because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, especially in the digital age. Not surprisingly, CrowdStrike has been a stellar performer over the past four quarters, generating an average EPS of 86 cents. This print translated to an earnings surprise of 15.83%.\n\nIn the TTM period, the cybersecurity specialist posted net income of $131.66 million or 54 cents per share. Revenue reached $3.28 billion. For the current fiscal year, experts are seeking 29.4% growth in EPS to $4. On the top line, sales may see a 30.8% boost to $4 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the cutting-edge tech stocks to consider.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nMoving over to the riskier side of cutting-edge tech stocks, C3.ai (NYSE:AI) specializes in enterprise-level AI. It develops software applications for multiple industries along with government agencies. One of its main attributes is that it provides mechanisms for predictive maintenance. That can be especially crucial for both civilian and military uses, impacting safety and operational integrity.\n\nFurther, what makes C3.ai appealing to speculators is that the underlying innovation enables practical uses of AI to foster productivity. Still, it\u2019s a risky idea, with shares in red ink over a 52-week basis. Further, the company isn\u2019t profitable, producing a loss per share of 11.5 cents in the past four quarters. That said, the quarterly surprise during this period came out to just under 48%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, C3.ai posted a net loss of $279.7 million or $2.34 per share in the red. Revenue in the cycle reached $310.58 million. For the current fiscal year, analysts believe the loss per share may unfavorably widen by nearly 15% to 54 cents. However, sales could see a 23.4% jump to $383.39 million.\n\nVeritone (VERI) AI stocks to buy now, Graphic of letters \"AI\" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Tex vector\n\nBased in Irvine, California, Veritone (NASDAQ:VERI) is an AI technology firm. Its main call to fame is its platform called aiWARE, which integrates AI solutions to process, transform and analyze audio, video and text data in real-time. In particular, media and entertainment agencies utilize Veritone\u2019s services for content creation, management and monetization.\n\nWith so much material moving to online platforms, Veritone could be able to carve out a powerful niche. However, the problem is volatility. After soaring to blistering heights in April this year, VERI stock has plunged badly. Therefore, it\u2019s undoubtedly a speculative entity. It\u2019s not profitable either, producing a loss per share of 23 cents over the past four quarters.\n\nIn the TTM period, Veritone incurred a net loss of $60.86 million or $1.63 per share. Revenue during the period reached $128.93 million. For fiscal 2024, experts do see a significant improvement in the loss per share to 35 cents. That\u2019s a far cry from $1.01 in the red. Also, revenue may pop 8.1% to hit $137.9 million.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 35.9% of the Entire Nasdaq-100 Index",
        "content": "The Nasdaq-100 index is made up of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It's often used as a barometer for the performance of the technology sector, but it also features stocks from the retail, healthcare, transportation, and media industries.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is weighted by market capitalization, which means larger companies have a greater influence over its performance than smaller companies. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a surge in the value of some of America's trillion-dollar tech stocks, and the following five now make up 35.9% of the entire index:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has a market cap of $3.3 trillion. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap of $3.2 trillion. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a market cap of $3 trillion. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap of $2.2 trillion. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has a market cap of $2 trillion.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 is up 18.9% so far in 2024. However, the Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted index -- which assigns the same representation to all 100 companies regardless of size -- is up just 6.2%. The difference can be explained (in part) by the outperformance of the above five stocks, which have delivered an average return of 47.3% year to date.\n\nEach of the five companies has a track record of success spanning decades, and they are now deploying their vast financial resources to dominate the fast-growing AI industry. If they succeed, they could have an even greater influence over the Nasdaq-100 in the future.\n\n1. Microsoft: 8.71% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nMicrosoft is the world's largest company, which is an impressive feat given it was founded way back in 1975. To maintain its near 50-year track record of success, Microsoft had to expand beyond its roots in software development by moving into other growth industries like gaming, cloud computing, and now, AI.\n\nMicrosoft agreed to invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI last year, and it used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to develop its own virtual assistant called Copilot. It's capable of answering complex questions, and generating text, images, and computer code on command. Copilot is now integrated into some of Microsoft's flagship products including Windows, Edge, Bing, and 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more), to help businesses and consumers increase their productivity.\n\nEnterprises can also access OpenAI's models through the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, which they can use to develop their own AI applications. Microsoft says 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are already using Azure OpenAI Service, which speaks to the surging demand for this new technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is a widely recognized leader in AI, and the company is likely to continue creating value for investors over the long term.\n\n2. Apple: 8.5% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, which includes the flagship iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac line of computers. Apple recently announced its own AI software called Apple Intelligence, which was developed in partnership with OpenAI, and it could make the company the world's largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to launch with the iOS 18 operating system in September. It will transform existing Apple features like the Siri voice assistant, which will draw on the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT. Plus, users will be able to instantly craft text content inside writing tools like Notes, iMessage, and Mail.\n\nApple Intelligence could drive a significant upgrade cycle when the new iPhone 16 smartphone is released later this year, which is expected to come with a new chipset designed specifically for processing AI workloads on-device. Apple's gigantic installed base places it at the forefront of AI's shift away from the data center and into the devices we use each day.\n\n3. Nvidia: 7.89% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nNvidia was a $360 billion company at the start of 2023. In just the last 18 months, it added $2.7 trillion to its market cap to join the $3 trillion club alongside Apple and Microsoft. The company's incredible growth stems from surging demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the best in the world for training and inferencing AI models.\n\nNvidia's H100 GPU set the industry benchmark, but the company is gearing up to ship a new generation of chips based on its more advanced Blackwell architecture. Its upcoming GB200, for example, can inference AI models 5 times faster than the H100, which could save developers substantial amounts of money as they typically pay for computing capacity by the minute.\n\nNvidia's data center revenue soared 427% year over year during the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended April 28), coming in at a record $22.6 billion. Competition is ramping up but Nvidia remains comfortably ahead, so its run of success looks set to continue (at least in the near term).\n\n4. Alphabet: 5.54% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAlphabet is the tech conglomerate behind Google, YouTube, Waymo, DeepMind, and more. Google Search remains the organization's largest source of revenue, and considering it has been the window to the internet for over two decades, it arguably has more valuable data with which to develop AI than any other company.\n\nAlphabet has developed a series of AI models, culminating in Gemini, which is designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4. Gemini operates as a stand-alone chatbot, but it can also be integrated into popular Google Workspace applications like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail for an extra fee, allowing users to rapidly craft content and boost their productivity.\n\nGoogle Search now also uses generative AI to deliver text-based responses to queries, saving users from having to sift through web pages looking for answers. It's helping to fend off threats from competitors like Microsoft Bing, which is powered by ChatGPT.\n\nInvestors seem to appreciate Alphabet's AI progress, because they have catapulted its stock to an all-time high this year and right into the $2 trillion club.\n\n5. Amazon: 5.33% of the Nasdaq-100\n\nAmazon is one of the most versatile AI companies. The technology powers the recommendation engine on its globally dominant e-commerce website, amazon.com, which learns what products customers like to buy and shows them similar ones in an effort to boost sales. Plus, it offers sellers a suite of AI tools to help them craft more engaging product descriptions, images, and advertisements.\n\nAmazon is also home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which designed its own AI data center chips, called Trainium and Inferentia; its own family of large language models (LLMs), called Titan; and even its own virtual assistant, called Amazon Q. Plus, Amazon invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic, which now uses AWS as its primary cloud provider and has committed to training its future models using Amazon's chips.\n\nAmazon hopes this will entice other start-ups and AI developers into the AWS ecosystem, giving it the edge over competitors like Microsoft Azure.\n\nAmazon's valuation surpassed $2 trillion just last week on the back of its surging stock, which currently trades near an all-time high. That momentum is likely to build as the company reaps more rewards from its aggressive expansion into AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy With Less Than $1,000",
        "content": "Buying shares of growing companies is one of the best ways to grow your money. The stock market has its down years, as investors were reminded of in 2022, but over many decades, companies that consistently grow can produce compounding returns that multiply a small sum into a sizable amount of money.\n\nAssuming you have some extra cash you don't need for paying bills or reducing debt, here are two outstanding growth stocks you can buy with less than $1,000.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThe semiconductor industry is a ripe field to look at for growth stocks. Every decade has seen new electronic devices that drive more demand for processors. But the increasing investment in large data centers to train artificial intelligence (AI) models will drive record revenue for leading chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nTSMC, as it is also known, is the leading manufacturer of the most advanced chips. Its customers include leading semiconductor companies like Nvidia, Intel, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Its expertise in developing cutting-edge chip technology has translated into a very profitable business. Last year, TSMC produced $27 billion in net profit on $69 billion of revenue.\n\nRight now is a particularly good time to consider buying shares because TSMC is just emerging out of a cyclical downswing in semiconductor demand. Despite recent weakness in smartphone chips, TSMC still delivered first-quarter revenue growth of 16% over the year-ago quarter. The company is targeting annual revenue growth between 15% and 20% through 2026 as the industry recovers.\n\nOne opportunity for TSMC is the exploding investment in data center infrastructure. The company is seeing strong demand for its most advanced 3-nanometer and 5nm chips, driven by AI-related applications. Management expects AI-related demand to grow at an annualized rate of 50% over the next five years.\n\nOver the last 30 years, TSMC has grown revenue and earnings at a 17% annualized rate. That growth would have turned a $10,000 investment into $585,000 including dividend reinvestment over that three-decade span. The stock is up 70% over the last year, beating the S&P 500's return of 25%, and should continue to outperform in the coming years.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nSoftware is another lucrative market to look at for long-term winners. Many people are familiar with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) consumer products like Windows and Office, but it's a major player in cloud services, which benefits from growing demand for AI services. The stock outpaced the broader market over the last year by rising 35%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn cloud services, Microsoft continues to gain market share of the cloud computing market, where it currently ranks No. 2 behind Amazon. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 23% year over year last quarter, as revenue from customer cloud migrations accelerated.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud business benefits from new AI services launched over the last year. The number of Azure deals valued at $100 million or more increased 80% year over year in the most recent quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's AI-powered Copilot tool is being widely adopted by enterprise customers. Companies find this tool incredibly valuable to speed up employee workflows and make faster decisions. Almost 60% of the Fortune 500 are using Copilot for Microsoft 365.\n\nMicrosoft has grown revenue and earnings at double-digit rates, and its innovation in AI software should keep that streak going. If Microsoft can grow its earnings at an annualized rate in the low teens, as Wall Street analysts expect, investors should expect that growth to triple their investment over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in July",
        "content": "A boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market at the start of 2023 kicked off just when tech stocks needed it most. Companies were dealing with the aftermath of an economic downturn the year before, which led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector to plunge 40% in 2022. However, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT seemed to breathe life back into the industry and reminded investors of the vast growth potential of tech stocks. As a result, the same index has soared 88% since Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nCompanies across tech have ventured into AI, an industry projected to hit close to $2 trillion in spending by the decade's end. The generative technology can potentially boost countless sectors as demand for AI services and the chips that make them possible soar.\n\nDespite this explosion of growth in the past 18 months, it's not too late to invest in the market and profit from its long-term development. Here are two AI stocks to buy hand over fist in July.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been slightly overlooked amid the rally in AI. While rivals like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) have seen their stocks rise 745% and 144% since the start of last year, Intel's share price has increased a more moderate 18%. A series of challenges over the last decade have made Wall Street weary, including lost market share in the chip industry and the end of a lucrative partnership with Apple.\n\nHowever, Intel has announced significant structural changes in its business model over the last year that could trigger a change in fortunes for the chipmaker. The company is shifting its focus to two high-growth markets: AI and manufacturing. Consequently, Intel unveiled its Gaudi 3 AI accelerators this year, which undercut Nvidia in price and offer similar performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is building chip plants throughout the U.S. as it works to retake the top spot in manufacturing and become the primary chip fab in the country. The move could allow Intel to profit from rising chip demand across the market as companies like Nvidia and AMD outsource their manufacturing. INTC PE Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, the data in the table above shows Intel's stock is a bargain compared to its competitors. Its considerably lower price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) suggests its stock offers far more value, making it a no-brainer this July.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nLike Intel, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock is trading at a significantly better value than its rivals. The company is in steep competition with cloud giants Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as AI has boosted the entire industry. Alphabet has the third-largest market share in cloud computing (after Microsoft and Amazon), yet is quickly catching up.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the chart below shows Alphabet's shares potentially offer far more value than its rivals. The Google company's lower P/E and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios suggest Alphabet could be one of the best-valued stocks in AI. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's revenue rose 15% year over year to $81 billion, beating analysts' expectations by nearly $2 billion. The company profited from a 14% spike in Google Services revenue and a 28% increase in Google Cloud sales. Alphabet's cloud revenue growth is especially impressive as it beat Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud growth for the quarter, with sales for those platforms rising 21% and 17% year over year.\n\nCloud computing has become a crucial growth area in AI as businesses increasingly use such services to integrate the technology into their workflows. As a result, Alphabet has invested heavily in expanding its AI offerings over the last year, introducing new tools to Google Cloud, adding generative features to Google Search, and improving its ad services.\n\nAlphabet hit $69 billion in free cash flow this year, only strengthening the argument for its stock. The figure suggests the tech giant has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and keep up with its rivals. That, alongside its bargain price point, makes Alphabet a stock to buy hand over fist this month.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Among Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top Stock Picks Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\n\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\n\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\n\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power.

        "title": "Salesforce, Inc. (CRM): Is Billionaire Phillipe Laffont Bullish On This Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\n\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\n\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\n\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high.

Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big.

In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\n\nA customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss believes that Salesforce\u2019s PEG ratio of 1.2 indicates that the market has yet to price in operational discipline and earnings growth sustainability and has therefore given it an Overweight with a $320 price target. Similarly, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Gregg Moskowitz states that the company still is well positioned to help customers in digital transformation but needs to prioritize profitable growth. The analyst reiterated his Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $300.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey, Fisher Asset Management is a prominent investor in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) holding 10.8 million shares valued at around $3 billion and Coatue Management holds 4.7 million shares worth $1.4 billion.\n\nHarding Loevner Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLeading software companies have the advantage of high switching costs and the ability to incorporate new features into products customers already use. For example, Microsoft has added its Copilot chatbot functionality to everything from search (Bing Chat, recently renamed to just Copilot) to coding (GitHub Copilot) and workplace applications (Copilot for Microsoft 365). Software sold by Microsoft and other companies such as\u00a0Salesforce, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:CRM), SAP, and\u00a0ServiceNow are also already deeply integrated into their customers\u2019 operations and workflow.\n\nAs large enterprises search for the right balance, Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud, a flagship offering, is designed to address a critical issue for them so they can make better use of AI tools. After a hectic buildout over the last few years of \u201cdata warehouses\u201d and \u201cdata lakes\u201d\u2014two types of repositories for storing and processing data\u2014across the various business units of large companies, many companies are left with what feels like islands of trapped data. Data Cloud solves this by creating a single platform to access and leverage all of an enterprise\u2019s data, eliminating the need to constantly duplicate large amounts of information across different platforms. Users are then able to apply generative-AI technology, such as Salesforce\u2019s Einstein tool, to a more comprehensive dataset, which enables them to better glean customers\u2019 intentions, personalize marketing messages, and automate the processing of customer-service requests. As users build these systems, Einstein\u2019s copiloting functionality helps their programmers work more efficiently so that IT departments with limited budgets and manpower can still develop the necessary tools. Salesforce\u2019s management projects that revenue and earnings will climb about 9% and 45%, respectively, in fiscal 2025, citing the company\u2019s operating leverage and cost discipline. We think these figures are achievable given the renewed focus on profitable growth, and so we added to the stock during the quarter.\u201d\n\nOverall CRM ranks 4th on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks. You can visit Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picksto see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar.

        "title": "Google\u2019s Emissions Shot Up 48% Over Five Years Due to AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s emissions climbed by almost half over five years, as the company has infused artificial intelligence throughout many of its core products \u2014 making it harder to meet its goal of eliminating carbon emissions by 2030, according to a new environmental report from the tech giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Powerful Storm Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada Strike S&P 500 Closes Above 5,500 in Record-Breaking Run: Markets Wrap \u2018Upflation\u2019 Is the New Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely\n\nThe annual report was released Tuesday and covers Google\u2019s progress toward meeting its environmental goals last year. The Alphabet Inc. unit said its greenhouse gas emissions totaled 14.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent throughout 2023. This is 48% higher than in 2019, the company said, and 13% higher than in 2022. Google said higher energy consumption at its data centers and emissions from its supply chain were to blame, and said its push to add AI to its products could make it more difficult to reduce emissions going forward.\n\n\u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google wrote in the report.\n\nFor several years, the Mountain View, California-based company has said it plans to eliminate such emissions from its operations by 2030.\n\nAI \u2014 and in particular generative AI, which takes in user inputs and spits out new content like text, images or songs \u2014 is extremely resource-intensive, as a recent Bloomberg News investigation showed. As the technology grows rapidly, more and more data centers are needed to build and run it, leading to surging power requirements.\n\nThe dramatic increase in power demands from Silicon Valley\u2019s growth-at-all-costs approach to AI threatens to upend the energy transition plans of entire nations as well as the clean energy goals of trillion-dollar tech companies. In some countries, including Saudi Arabia, Ireland and Malaysia, the energy required to run all the data centers they plan to build at full capacity exceeds the available supply of renewable energy, according to a Bloomberg analysis of the latest available data.\n\nGoogle is not the first major technology company to cite the rapid growth of AI as an obstacle to achieving environmental goals. In May, Microsoft Corp. said its carbon emissions climbed 30% since 2020, as the company increasingly invested in AI. The increase made that company\u2019s target of getting to below net-zero emissions by 2030 even harder than it was when it announced its carbon-negative goal.\n\nStory continues\n\nSasha Luccioni, climate lead at startup Hugging Face Inc., said the data show tech companies weren\u2019t anticipating the massive growth of AI when they set their environmental goals. \u201cThey couldn't have,\u201d she said. \u201cThe baseline year in that Google report was 2019 \u2014 definitely not anticipating it.\u201d Companies have been blindsided both by how much energy is required to build such technology, Luccioni said, and how much energy is required to run it.\n\nListen on Zero: Microsoft Wanted to be Carbon Negative. Then It Went Big on AI\n\n--With assistance from Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Steve Ballmer, who was once Bill Gates\u2019 assistant, is now richer than his onetime mentor",
        "content": "When Steve Ballmer joined Microsoft he didn\u2019t get a single company share. But now, his skyrocketing Microsoft holdings have made him richer than the company\u2019s founder.\n\nThe 68-year-old former Microsoft CEO squeaked by his onetime boss Bill Gates to become the sixth richest person in the world on Monday with a net worth of $157 billion. He is now richer than many well-known tech entrepreneurs including Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time that Ballmer\u2019s net worth has surpassed that of Gates, and one of the few times in history an employee has come to be richer than a company\u2019s founder. Ballmer is the only person with a net worth of $100 billion or more who made their money as an employee rather than a founder, as Fortune previously reported.\n\nBallmer\u2019s net worth was boosted by a rally in Microsoft\u2019s shares, which closed at an all-time high on Tuesday and have surged 22% since January. Shares of the company represent about 90% of his net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and Microsoft has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom fueling markets, thanks to its $10 billion investment in OpenAI.\n\nIn 2014, Ballmer left Microsoft with about a 4% stake worth $22.5 billion, according to Forbes. At the time, he said that he was holding on to his shares for the long term, Forbes reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to own Microsoft shares until I either give something to charity or I die,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, Gates has diversified his portfolio over the years away from the company he founded, with half of his holdings now managed through private investment firm Cascade Investment. He has a $21 billion stake in waste management company Republic Services through Cascade, Bloomberg reported.\n\nGiving away money\n\nGates\u2019 major philanthropic donations also factor in. As of 2023, Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates had donated $59.5 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, turning it into the one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations. In 2010, Gates also cocreated the Giving Pledge with French Gates and investor Warren Buffett, and has promised to give away most of his wealth during his lifetime.\n\nAlthough Steve Ballmer\u2019s holdings have made him one of the richest men in the world, when he joined as the company\u2019s 30th employee in 1980, he didn\u2019t get a single share. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he served as a quasi\u2013personal assistant to Bill Gates with the unimpressive title \u201cbusiness manager,\u201d Forbes reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, because Microsoft was looking to grow rapidly at the time, Gates and his cofounder, Paul Allen, agreed to give Ballmer 10% of the profit growth he generated on top of his $50,000 yearly salary.\n\nThat deal turned out to be key to Ballmer\u2019s future wealth. Soon, Microsoft was growing so fast that Ballmer\u2019s 10% cut no longer made sense financially for the company. When Microsoft reorganized as a corporation, Ballmer negotiated an 8% slice for himself in exchange for giving up his profit-sharing deal, while Gates and Allen kept 84% and another 8% was designated for other employees, Forbes reported. Although Allen was opposed to giving Ballmer such a large stake, Gates stepped in and said Ballmer\u2019s 8% cut could be funded by a drawdown of his own holdings, according to Forbes.\n\nWhile at the time Gates put his own money on the line for Ballmer, the two have since drifted apart.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft was kind of the thing that really bound us,\u201d Ballmer told Bloomberg Television in 2016. \u201cWe started off as friends, but then really got quite enmeshed around Microsoft. Since I\u2019ve gone, we really have drifted a little bit.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple Poised to Get OpenAI Board Observer Role as Part of AI Pact",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will get an observer role on OpenAI\u2019s board as part of a landmark agreement announced last month, further tightening ties between the once-unlikely partners.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Powerful Storm Beryl Aims at Jamaica After Grenada Strike S&P 500 Closes Above 5,500 in Record-Breaking Run: Markets Wrap \u2018Upflation\u2019 Is the New Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely\n\nPhil Schiller, the head of Apple\u2019s App Store and its former marketing chief, was chosen for the position, according to people familiar with the situation. As a board observer, he won\u2019t be serving as a full-fledged director, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public.\n\nThe move follows Apple\u2019s announcement in June that it would offer ChatGPT in the iPhone, iPad and Mac as part of a suite of artificial intelligence features. The board arrangement will take effect later this year, and Schiller hasn\u2019t yet attended any meetings, according to the people. Details of the situation could still change.\n\nThe board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer and its main AI technology provider. The job allows someone to attend board meetings without being able to vote or exercise other director powers. Observers, however, do gain insights into how decisions are made at the company.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple and OpenAI declined to comment.\n\nHaving Microsoft and Apple sit in on board meetings could create complications for the tech giants, which have been rivals and partners over the decades. Some OpenAI board meetings will likely discuss future AI initiatives between OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 deliberations that the latter company may want Schiller excluded from. Board observers often do oblige and exit meetings during discussions that are seen as sensitive.\n\nThough Schiller doesn\u2019t lead Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence initiatives, his veteran role as a steward of the company\u2019s brand makes him well-suited to the observer job. The 64-year-old stepped down as head of marketing in 2020, and his current title is Apple Fellow. In addition to overseeing the App Store, he still manages the company\u2019s product launch events. Outside of Apple, he\u2019s a director at medical technology company Illumina Inc.\n\nWith the OpenAI partnership, Apple is teaming up with the biggest and most influential AI startup \u2014 but also a business known for controversy and upheaval. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was briefly ousted last year over concerns that he wasn\u2019t candid enough with the board. The company also has drawn criticism for downplaying AI safety fears and using a digital voice that sounded similar to actress Scarlett Johansson without an agreement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe OpenAI integration is one component of Apple\u2019s overall AI strategy, which also includes in-house features. Its technology \u2014 called Apple Intelligence \u2014 summarizes articles and notifications, creates custom emojis and images, and transcribes voice memos. The effort also includes a revamped version of Apple\u2019s Siri digital assistant, but many of those enhancements won\u2019t arrive until next year.\n\nApple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI isn\u2019t a financial arrangement, at least for now. Instead of money changing hands, OpenAI is getting access to hundreds of millions of potential users. For its part, Apple gains a chatbot feature that many consumers are clamoring for. Users also will be able to access a paid version of ChatGPT on Apple devices, and that could generate App Store fees for the iPhone maker.\n\nApple remains in discussions with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and startup Anthropic about offering additional chatbots to customers. It\u2019s also discussing potential agreements with Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring its AI features to devices in China. Apple Intelligence will launch initially in American English before an international rollout.\n\nTop Apple executives frequently serve as directors of other companies, but joining the board of a high-profile partner is rare. Apple, did, however, briefly hold a board seat at DiDi Global Inc. after investing $1 billion in the China-based Uber rival.\n\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America The Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 AI Stock Winners Defying Tech Sector Turbulence",
        "content": "With the kick-off of the year\u2019s second half underway, investors may wonder if the same themes that outperformed in the first half will continue to work. Undoubtedly, AI chip stocks will still stand out as exciting growth bets for investors looking to play the technological revolution.\n\nGiven the likelihood that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will extend for many years, it\u2019s probably a tad too soon to dump your biggest AI winners just because the first half saw a slight uptick in volatility.\n\nIndeed, for long-term benefit growth in AI, investors will need to face volatility head on. This is not just on a weekly basis, but perhaps over a quarterly basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStaying invested in the top AI stocks will entail plenty of turbulence along the way. An example is the odd 15-20% correction like the one recently experienced by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Perhaps expect the near halving of a stock if fear becomes the main emotion on Wall Street.\n\nEither way, let\u2019s examine three stocks that have defied recent tech turbulence and could continue doing for 2024\u2019s second half.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nDespite posting a remarkably strong finish to the second half, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares still trailed the performance of the Nasdaq 100 year-to-date (YTD). With an explosive first day to the second half, with AAPL stock surging close to 5% on July 1, perhaps Apple could be in a position to lead tech higher.\n\nToday, AAPL shares are at new all-time highs, $220 per share, while NVDA stock is off more than 8% after running into a speed bump in June. Indeed, Nvidia was in the driver\u2019s seat of tech and AI in the first half. For the second half, I view Apple as having the better, perhaps less-appreciated catalysts. And these may fuel a second-half surge that could be tops for the Magnificent Seven.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the coming AI features on iOS 18 and the positive impact on iPhone sales, either. Apple seems to be catching a break in China for a change. A Bloomberg report recently noted that iPhone shipments rose 40% for the month of May. Prior discounts seem to have worked in a big way.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another tech titan that\u2019s stood tall in the face of slight turbulence. MSFT stock is at new highs of $458.79 per share, with June turbulence barely affecting the $3.4 trillion tech and AI behemoth.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives views Microsoft (as well as Nvidia) as driving the AI revolution. He\u2019s certainly not wrong. These two AI stocks are at the very top of their class right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIves sees Microsoft as driving a \u201cBugatti\u201d (a really, really fast car) at \u201c100 mph\u201d in the AI race, where most of its peers drive markedly slower cars. Specifically, Ives noted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) drives a mere \u201cminivan.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting analogy that tells the story of current happenings in AI.\n\nAs AI supercharges the Azure cloud business, Amazon may struggle to stay atop the cloud. Recently, Amazon Web Services (AWS) doubled the value of credits for startups, which may suggest worry over Microsoft\u2019s cloud momentum. In any case, Microsoft looks unstoppable and perhaps still somewhat affordable, even as the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio flirts with 40 times.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) stock has been holding strong after some late-June turbulence.\n\nOver the past month, HPE stock has risen more than 18%, marking an impressive finish to the first half, which saw HPE surge close to 25%. Shares are just 3% off their all-time highs, just shy of $22 per share. Perhaps the under-the-radar AI beneficiary is worth watching as the market faces critical tests in the second half.\n\nWith more investor focus shifting to data center plays, HPE stock looks as timely as it does cheap. The stock trades at just 15.45 times trailing P/E, quite a bargain for a firm that could soon feel the full force of AI tailwinds.\n\nTruly, HP Enterprises\u2019 partnership with Nvidia could pay major dividends as enterprise customers look to buy into the new service \u201cNvidia AI Computing by HPE.\u201d The HPE-Nvidia collaboration is a massive deal that could supercharge HPE\u2019s growth, putting it on the AI fast track.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Microsoft.

        "title": "Considering Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Ahead Of Earnings Report? Here's A Better Alternative",
        "content": "Considering Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Ahead Of Earnings Report? Here's A Better Alternative\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella has made the Redmond software giant the biggest beneficiary of the AI revolution thanks to his vision and strategy. In 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hardly anyone noticed. But when ChatGPT was launched and the floodgates of generative AI innovation opened, Microsoft was seen as the leader in the AI arms race. Microsoft\u2019s investments in OpenAI have now swelled to $13 billion. The company's long list of AI catalysts includes the revival of Bing Search, AI assistant Co-pilot, and AI PCs, among many others.\n\nIs MSFT Overvalued?\n\nHowever, some believe the stock has run too much and needs a breather amid Wall Street's growing concerns that just a handful of companies now account for most of the market gains. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett recently said in a note that the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, including MSFT, is poised to see \"radical deceleration\" in earnings growth, according to a report by Seeking Alpha. Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin calculates that Microsoft's sales growth in the second quarter will come in at 15%, down from 17% in the previous quarter, as per another report by Seeking Alpha. The company is expected to report earnings on July 23. As the company gets too much spotlight and AI expectations from the stock are too high, any decline in growth in the upcoming earnings could cause the stock to fall.\n\nThere are always undervalued players in the market for those who know where to look. Let's discuss an AI underdog that analysts believe has more upside based on its strong growth catalysts.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor: A Better AI Stock Than MSFT?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one of the world\u2019s most important and biggest semiconductor companies. Tweaktown reports that the company's long list of customers includes tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and Broadcom, among many others. The AI revolution is expected further to bolster Taiwan Semiconductor's demand and market share. According to Tweaktown's report, the company has a whopping 70% to 80% share of the 5nm semiconductor market and a 90% share of the 3nm chips market. Data from consultancy firm TrendForce shows that Taiwan Semiconductor had a 60% share of the global foundry market as of 2021.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's AI Revenue Growth Projections\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's chips are used in everything from smartphones to electric car sensors and PCs. However, the huge demand for high-end chips unlocked by the generative AI boom has made TSM a promising AI stock. During a first quarter earnings call, Taiwan Semiconductor's management said it expects revenue contribution from AI processors to double this year and account for low-teens percent of total revenue. Revenue from AI is expected to grow at a 50% CAGR over the next five years and account for over 20% of the company's total revenue by 2028.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's Moat in the Industry\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's moat in the AI chips industry is strong and wide. Firstly, the high-end chip manufacturing industry isn't easy to enter, even for major companies. Blackridge Research and Consulting firm reports that establishing a single 3nm fab could cost up to $20 billion. On top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor's real strength lies in churning millions of chips with almost no defects \u2014 the company's yield is over 95%, according to the Atlantic Council. Only Samsung is expected to come close to Taiwan Semiconductor's quality and manufacturing capability in the coming years amid its huge investments and plans to foray into the fab industry. Other than Taiwan Semiconductor, it has no formidable competitors.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nIs the China Threat Overblown?\n\nDespite its dominance in the AI chips industry, Taiwan Semiconductor's share price growth has been capped, and its valuation still looks attractive compared to its peers. The stock's forward P/E is 27.7 (47 for Nvidia and 46 for AMD). The biggest concern around TSM is a possible Chinese escalation against Taiwan since the company's major manufacturing operations are based in Taiwan. However, many analysts believe these concerns are overblown and the company has no short-term risks. They say China cannot afford to go into a direct conflict with the US. According to a report by the Hudson Institute, any disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry could result in a $1.6 trillion economic loss to the US. Taiwan Semiconductor's chip industry dominance is seen as a \u2018Silicon Shield' for Taiwan, which the country can use to deter attacks. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor's Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said that it's \"impossible\" to move chip manufacturing outside of Taiwan and that 80% to 90% of chip manufacturing remains in the country.\n\nWall Street Thinks AI Boom Will Benefit Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWall Street is also growing bullish on the company. Recently, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said that high-end phones and advanced nodes could result in Taiwan Semiconductor topping its 2024 guidance. The analyst thinks the company\u2019s data center revenue is growing as expected. Li increased his price target for TSM to $200 from $150. He expects Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue to increase by 25% and EPS by 28% in 2024. Earlier this month, BofA's Brad Lin also increased his price target for TSM to $180. Lin thinks new AI plans revealed by Apple and other companies at the Computex 2024 event would drive the on-device AI trend, benefiting TSMC, which the analyst called the \"key enabler\" of AI prosperity.\n\nThere Are Better High-Yield Opportunities\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "title": "3 High-Momentum Stocks That Are Way Cheaper Than Nvidia",
        "content": "Even with a slight early-summer correction on the books, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock still finished the first half of 2024 as one of the biggest and brightest winners, with a gain of around 152%. That\u2019s an amazing return in a six-year timespan, let alone a six-month one.\n\nUndoubtedly, Nvidia is no longer the world\u2019s largest company, but as shares look to regain their footing and power higher again, I\u2019d not bet against NVDA stock making another run for that top spot. Perhaps its next leg higher could leave Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) behind.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s hard to tell when the next leg for NVDA stock will be. For momentum investors, Nvidia isn\u2019t the only game in town. There are other booming stocks in the market, many of which trade at far lower valuation multiples.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this piece, we\u2019ll look at three cheaper high-momentum stocks, hoping to follow up on impressive first-half showings.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location with doors open)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) is having a powerful resurgence, with the stock soaring more than 111% year to date. Undoubtedly, apparel is a tough place to be these days, but Abercrombie has found a way to buck the trend and pull off one of the biggest comeback stories in all of retail.\n\nFor Abercrombie, the big top- and bottom-line beats keep coming in. Over the past two years, much-improved quarterly numbers have helped shares skyrocket close to 950%. Despite the parabolic surge, however, ANF stock still looks cheap at 21.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nGiven newfound sales momentum and a reinvigorated brand resonating with young crowds again, it\u2019s a mistake to bet against the firm as it may just be in a spot to take a bigger bite out of the apparel market. Undoubtedly, the turnaround strategy has been a profound success. Now, the big question is if Abercrombie can keep it up. As it tackles international markets, perhaps ANF stock\u2019s run still has legs.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) An image of the logo for Broadcom Inc (AVGO).\n\nSource: Broadcom\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an AI chip titan that may be worth checking in on after its June swoon. With AVGO stock now down 10% from last month\u2019s all-time high, the AI darling may have investors biting their nails as some seek to take profits after a remarkable first-half gain of around 50%.\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analyst Vivek Arya thinks the jitters over AVGO stock are not warranted. In fact, he\u2019s a huge fan of the company\u2019s \u201cdiverse growth drivers,\u201d strong management and the dividend. Indeed, Broadcom\u2019s AI potential is widely recognized by many. It\u2019s no longer a stealthy way to bet on the AI race. That said, I find it quite intriguing that the firm maintains a relatively attractive dividend payout.\n\nStory continues\n\nMr. Arya notes AVGO stock\u2019s above-average yield (currently at 1.31%) and dividend growth prospects are additional reasons to pay a premium price tag. I couldn\u2019t agree more. Broadcom offers unrivaled exposure to AI growth in addition to a very generous and \u201cgrowth-y\u201d dividend. At 27.4 times forward P/E, AVGO stock also looks much cheaper than NVDA.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nSticking with the AI theme, we have Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), which is up an impressive 37% year-to-date. There is decent momentum behind ORCL stock going into the second half, but it is far less explosive versus Nvidia, Abercrombie and Broadcom. Still, I view Oracle as boasting a strong growth profile that can sustainably support the stock\u2019s newfound momentum for a few years.\n\nWith an impressive data center growth profile and a new in-database large language model (LLM) in HeatWave GenAI launching last month, Oracle stands out as an AI play that could finish the year with a bang.\n\nAt the time of writing, ORCL stock trades at 22.7 times forward P/E, making it a relative value play in the red-hot AI scene. With a 1.12% dividend yield, the name also stands out as a great dividend growth play to play the AI revolution for the longer term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Microsoft.

        "title": "Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation",
        "content": "Ever since the Federal Reserve went on a crusade to increase interest rates and slow the progression of inflation at the beginning of 2022, investors have been cheering for a Goldilocks-type of economic soft landing. Last month, this narrative remained intact.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged +3.5% for the month, the technology-heavy NASDAQ rocketed +6.0% (fueled by NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other AI-related companies), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average a more modest +1.1% move thanks to the contribution of older economy stocks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nDespite the looming presidential election this November and the recent debate, the stock market has continued on a +56% bull market tear since the October 2023-low, eight months ago (see chart below). The not-too-hot, not-too-cold economic data have provided comfort to investors. For example, growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the broadest measurement of economic activity, was positive (+1.4%) during the first quarter and it is expected to modestly accelerate in the second quarter (+2.2%), as forecasted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nIn addition, the job and inflation stories are staying consistent with the soft landing plot line, as well. The unemployment rate has been creeping higher, but currently remains near multi-decade lows at 4.0%. Inflation also continued its downward trend as evidenced by last week's Core PCE inflation data (the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge), which came in at +2.6%, the lowest level since March of 2021 (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nGasoline and food costs are significant inputs to the overall declining inflation dynamics. The two largest crops in the United States are corn and soybeans, and with those prices down significantly year-over-year (see chart below), it should come as no surprise that consumers are finally seeing some relief in skyrocketing food prices. Declining gasoline prices have also chipped-in to the improving inflation outlook. Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nWith all these economic statistics harmoniously aligning with a soft landing scenario, investors are currently comfortable in forecasting one interest rate cut over the next six months, and three and a half interest rate cuts over the next 12 months (see chart below). Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource:Yardeni Research\n\nBut a bull market cannot survive on interest rate cut expectations alone. Over the long-run, stock prices generally follow the direction of corporate profits, and as the chart below indicates (red line), fortunately, the path of profits has been rising after a period of stagnation last year.\n\nStory continues Economic and Inflation Information Create Market Jubilation\n\nSource: Yardeni Research\n\nThe last eight months have been an exhilarating ride in the overall stock market, which has been propelled by the multi-trillion dollar technology companies participating in the A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) buildout revolution (i.e., NVIDIA, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet-Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), et.al.). However, neither trees nor stock markets can grow, uninterrupted, to the sky forever. The recent environment has been jubilant for investors, but party participants cannot go on forever without experiencing a hangover. The best advice is to celebrate responsibly, while managing the risk of your investment portfolio, because eventually the cops will arrive and the party will come to an end.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (July 1, 2024).\n\nDISCLOSURE: Sidoxia Capital Management (SCM) and some of its clients hold positions in individual stocks , certain exchange traded funds (ETFs), including NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, META, and AMZN but at the time of publishing had no direct position in any other security referenced in this article.

        "content": "Bill Gates Was The 'World's Richest Man' For A Record 18 Years. His Secret To Success? 'Saving Like A Pessimist, Investing Like An Optimist'\n\nBill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and one of the most influential figures in the tech industry, is renowned for his business acumen and unique approach to financial management. After dropping out of college at 19, Gates cofounded Microsoft with Paul Allen, transforming it from a small startup into a global tech giant.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? \u2013 How does it compare to the average? Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% \u2013 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nGates dominated the Forbes list of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals from 1995 to 2017, holding the top spot for 18 out of 23 years. This unprecedented run showcases his ability to accumulate wealth and maintain and grow it over an extended period despite market fluctuations and economic challenges.\n\nAt the heart of Gates\u2019 financial philosophy lies a seemingly contradictory lesson which author and psychologist Morgan Housel observed in a 2021 CNBC article: \"Save like a pessimist, invest like an optimist.\" This maxim encapsulates his balanced approach to money management, a cornerstone of his success.\n\nThe Pessimist\u2019s Safety Net\n\nGates\u2019 pessimistic approach to saving is exemplified by a practice he implemented in Microsoft\u2019s early days. He insisted on always having enough cash in the bank to keep the company running for 12 months, even if revenue dropped to zero. This conservative strategy ensured Microsoft\u2019s survival during potential downturns and provided a solid foundation for growth.\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose, Gates reportedly expressed his concerns and the reasons for maintaining a consistent cash reserve. He stated, \"I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, \u2018What if we don\u2019t get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?\u2019\"\n\nTrending: Want to invest in homes? $10 is enough on this platform that lets you cash out whenever you want.\n\nThe Optimist\u2019s Growth Mindset\n\nWhile maintaining a pessimistic approach to saving, Gates advocated for optimism in investments. He believed in the long-term potential of markets and technology, making bold bets that ultimately paid off. This optimistic outlook drove Microsoft\u2019s innovation and expansion, contributing significantly to its dominant position in the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nHousel noted Gates\u2019 approach is rooted in a deep understanding of market dynamics. He believes that long-term progress is the general trend while short-term setbacks are inevitable. By preparing for immediate challenges (the pessimist\u2019s view) while remaining confident in future growth (the optimist\u2019s perspective), Gates created a stellar strategy for sustained success.\n\nAnyone can apply this mindset to personal financial management:\n\nBuild an emergency fund (save like a pessimist): Aim to have 3-6 months of living expenses saved, preparing for unexpected challenges. Invest for the long term (invest like an optimist): Despite market fluctuations, maintain faith in the long-term growth potential of diversified investments. Balance risk and security: While taking calculated risks for growth, ensure a safety net to weather short-term storms. Continuous learning: Stay informed about financial markets and emerging opportunities, adapting your strategy as needed. Plan for the worst, hope for the best: Create contingency plans while working towards ambitious financial goals.\n\nBill Gates\u2019 financial philosophy offers a valuable lesson in balancing caution and ambition. This balanced strategy, proven successful by one of the world\u2019s most prominent business leaders, provides a road map for achieving lasting financial stability and growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nNo generation before Gen Z has had this investment opportunity \u2013 How successful Zoomers plan to retire in their 30's.

        "content": "International Business Machines Corporation IBM recently collaborated with Microsoft Corporation MSFT to strengthen cybersecurity operations. This collaboration represents a significant step in the tech sector as the two companies leverage their respective strengths in cloud computing and AI technologies.\r\n\r\nThrough the integration of IBM's industry-leading cybersecurity services with Microsoft's comprehensive security technology portfolio, the companies aim to provide their clients with the tools and expertise needed to simplify and modernize their end-to-end security operations.\r\n\r\nAs part of the service, IBM's Threat Detection and Response (TDR) Cloud Native service will integrate Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Cloud with IBM's AI-powered security technologies. The service has earned Microsoft MXDR verified solution status for its integration with Microsoft's Security platform.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging the full range of Microsoft's security portfolio, TDR Cloud Native service will enable IBM's global team of security analysts to provide 24/7 monitoring, investigation, and automated remediation of security alerts across clients' hybrid cloud environments. This will likely accelerate the speed and efficacy of threat detection and response efforts for clients.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to simplify cloud identity management challenges, IBM and Microsoft have devised a comprehensive solution that incorporates Microsoft Entra suite of tools, enhanced by IBM's range of automation, accelerators and deep industry expertise.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration aims to streamline the cloud journey, optimize complex digital landscapes, and reduce costs associated with running multiple identity tools.

        "content": "Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies. It's also the most valuable public company in the world at the moment at $3.4 trillion. In addition to providing cloud-computing services, market-leading operating systems, and productivity software, the technology giant is also at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nStrong earnings results and emerging opportunities in AI have helped power strong performance for the company's stock lately. The software giant's share price is up 34% over the last year alone.\n\nEven more impressive, the stock has delivered a return of more than 1,160% since Satya Nadella became the company's CEO in February 2014. That means that if you invested $1,000 on the day Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, your investment would now be worth more than $12,570.\n\nNadella has worked wonders at Microsoft\n\nWith Microsoft on a winning streak, it might be easy to forget that the company was facing some major challenges at the time Nadella took over in the CEO role. Due to some failed projects and unproductive strategic directions, the company and its stock had a rocky start to the 2010s. But Microsoft managed to deliver an incredible turnaround.\n\nNadella spearheaded a pivot to a new strategy that focused on subscription services. The company shifted Office and other software away from being one-time licensing purchases and instead started selling them on a subscription basis. This made the company's sales more dependable and also helped boost margins.\n\nHe also oversaw the strategic prioritization and growth of the company's Azure cloud infrastructure services. Azure has grown at an incredible rate over the last decade, and it currently stands as the second-largest player by market share -- trailing behind only Amazon's AWS.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business is generating strong sales, growing rapidly, and posting impressive profit margins. It's also helped the company tap into emerging AI-driven demand, and the best is likely still to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Tuesday, July 2, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), as well as a micro-cap stock EVI Industries, Inc. (EVI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+21.4% vs. +15.1%), reflecting continued gains from from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+36.1% vs. +15.1%). The company\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results benefited from the steady adoption of strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and OCI, as well as a recovery in cloud revenue growth.\r\n\r\nIts Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence (AI) clientele because of better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL\u2019s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the uncertain economy and competition in the cloud computing market weighed on demand for its cloud offerings. Stiff competition in the cloud market is slowing down the growth of its expansion efforts in the competitive market.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)\r\n\r\nT-Mobile shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+11.6% vs. +11.1%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. The acquisition of U.S. Cellular\u2019s wireless operation will enable TMUS to expand its fast-growing home broadband offerings and fixed wireless products by tapping into the additional capacity and coverage.\r\n\r\nLong-term contracts with the U.S. Navy will likely boost commercial prospects. Lower operating expenses are boosting its margin. Solid growth in free cash flow underscores efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives.\r\n\r\nHowever, the highly competitive and saturated U.S. telecom market affects its growth potential. Promotional offers and low-priced service plans to expand the customer base are putting pressure on its profitability. Soft demand for prepaid services is a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of EVI have underperformed the Zacks Industrial Services industry over the past year (-17.5% vs. -10.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $224.96 million is facing challenges which include declining profitability, higher operating costs and interest expenses, competitive pressures, and environmental regulations, impacting margins and growth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, EVI is well-positioned in the growing dry-cleaning and laundry services market, benefiting from urbanization, increasing disposable incomes, and demand from the hotel sector. EVI's revenues reached $263.4 million in the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, driven by price increases to counter rising costs, improving gross profit margins to 29.6%.\r\n\r\nThe \"buy-and-build\" strategy, exemplified by acquiring ALCO Washer Center, enhances market presence and service capabilities. EVI maintains a strong balance sheet, reducing long-term debt to $21.9 million and a current ratio of 1.53. Innovations in smart-laundry solutions cater to environmental and convenience demands.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on EVI here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Walmart Inc.

        "title": "7 Long Haul Stocks to Create Lasting Wealth",
        "content": "Creating long-term wealth in the stock market is fundamentally simple: Pick a time-tested strategy, stick to it, sell your losers and ride out the winners, be patient and keep investing. It sounds relatively simple and it is but the question of which long haul stocks are likely to create wealth still arises.\n\nHistory has shown again and again that identifying sure winners is not as easy as it appears. Simply consider the stocks of companies that dominated several decades ago that no longer exist or are nearly bankrupt. Radio shack comes to mind, and retailers like Kmart also deserve a mention.\n\nThe point is that the brands and stocks that appear to be long-term winners sometimes turn out not to be. That makes establishing a long-term position difficult when times get tough. Just remember, do your research and stick to your plan. Long-term wealth doesn\u2019t come from abandoning a plan when things get dicey. Then you\u2019re trying to time the market which rarely works.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best tech stocks to consider in the quest to build wealth for the long haul.\n\nOf course, we can simply look back at its performance over the past 10 years and use that to suggest that it will continue to win. It has returned an average of nearly 29% over the past decade so it\u2019s hard to argue against Microsoft. It has returned an even more impressive 36% over the past 12 months.\n\nThat increased rate of return is an obvious product of Microsoft\u2019s strength in relation to artificial intelligence. The company invested early and heavily into AI and has reaped the benefits. Those benefits appear especially in Microsoft\u2019s cloud division, Azure, where growth has outpaced top line results.\n\nThat\u2019s the overarching point here, and the reason investors should look to Microsoft as a long haul stock to create long-term wealth: Microsoft was already a behemoth and got that much more powerful as a result of the early AI surge.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cans\n\nSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has long been recognized as a long-term stock worthy of investment. However, I believe some investors may have begun to question the validity of that assertion as global tastes shift.\n\nWhat I\u2019m referring to specifically is the shift away from sugary, carbonated beverages toward healthier alternatives. Sugar is more demonized than it has ever been. In turn, Coca-Cola should logically be at risk.\n\nHowever, the company isn\u2019t at risk and that truth is borne out through a few simple metrics. If Coca-Cola were in trouble it would show in the company\u2019s gross margins. The company wouldn\u2019t be as capable of charging higher prices if demand were worsening and that would show up as weaker margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola\u2019s gross margins are just about exactly where they\u2019ve been for the past 10 years. Much higher than the majority of competitors and very steady overall. Coca-Cola is one of a few buy and hold stocks that will cause no heartache and continuously reward through dividend income. It\u2019s as easy a choice as ever.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) satisfies one of the oldest maxims of investing: Dividends reinvested create long-term, compounding wealth that rich stock investors love.\n\nThis recent article spells out an exact scenario in which O stock is held over the last 10 years. It lays out the returns under a dividend reinvestment plan and one on which dividends are collected as cash. Unsurprisingly, the dividend reinvestment plan yields greater returns overall. Yet, the returns while collecting cash are also strong.\n\nI\u2019d recommend following the dividend reinvestment plan especially given the fact that O stock pays a monthly dividend that increases the frequency of compounding opportunities. However, that cash in hand can be used to seek other long-term wealth building opportunities as well.\n\nThe company continues to thrive and recently raised its earnings and investment guidance. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was increased as well. That\u2019s where dividends are paid from in real estate investment trusts (REITs) including Realty Income. It all continues to look very strong for the company as an investment.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a 10X stock. That\u2019s true of the shares of the last decade during which it has provided average annual returns of 26.4%. That means that $1,000 invested in Apple a decade ago is now worth more than $10,000.\n\nWe aren\u2019t living in the past though and the markets are forever forward looking. Until very recently, those markets were not particularly fond of Apple and its stock. That changed when Apple delivered good news at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nThe company unveiled its much anticipated take on AI, Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be more pragmatic and geared toward user experience primarily. That is in opposition to other tech firms where a land grab approach has dominated early on.\n\nThe addition of AI to the iPhone is particularly important to Apple and its stock. It is expected that updated, AI capable iPhones will revive slumping sales of late. Even if AI doesn\u2019t spike iPhone sales immediately, they will return as the economy improves on rate cuts later this year.\u00a0Apple has proven to be a winner for the long haul through its ability to create products that have mass appeal and create a cult like following.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are dozens of things to potentially talk about in relation to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock and its long-term outlook. Let\u2019s focus on its strength versus other U.S. Oil Majors and how the company is approaching the energy transition. Both of those factors, when combined, suggest that Exxon Mobil is an excellent long-term wealth building investment.\n\nMost energy investors are going to go one of two ways when it comes to overall strategy: They\u2019ll invest in green-leaning European energy firms or side with fossil fuel dominated American firms. Those who find more appeal in the latter category will likely whittle their choice down to Exxon Mobil and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). I\u2019d suggest choosing XOM because the company is far better at investing capital than its competitor. That ability to reap a higher return on invested capital than cost is referred to as \u2018value creation\u2019. Exxon Mobil excels in that regard.\n\nThat suggests to me that Exxon Mobil is particularly adept at reading market trends over time and investing appropriately. I can only imagine that the company will be better than its competition as it relates to directing capital during the energy transition as well.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is the best-positioned of the major tobacco stocks for the next 10 years. For that reason, I believe it\u2019s also the best choice to deliver long-term wealth to investors.\n\nAll of the major tobacco stocks are undergoing a massive, transitory period during which cigarette smoking has fallen and these companies have been forced to pivot.\n\nHowever, it is Philip Morris that has handled the transition best. Over the past five years its share prices are up 32%. That\u2019s not great when compared to the broader market but it is much better than Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), both of which have fallen during the same period.\n\nPhilip Morris has introduced products that meet changing consumer demand profiles including the incredibly popular Zyn nicotine pouches. The company can\u2019t even keep up with demand for the product.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the broader narrative suggesting that Philip Morris is a great buy and hold stock. It provides a strong dividend and is managing the tobacco transition very well.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) stock has certainly been much stronger in the past. The company is facing issues from multiple angles and currently trades for less than $260 per share after beginning 2024 at $297.\n\nWhether it\u2019s boycotts related to the Middle East or claims of rampant price gouging, McDonald\u2019s has certainly seen better days. McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t expect the effects of those boycotts to worsen demand further but also expects no improvement until the war ends. Some believe the war to be unwinnable and that a peace accord could soon materialize as a result.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s also recently released its popular $5 value meal that includes a McDouble or a McChicken, a four piece nugget, small fries, and a small drink. The company is running the promotion in response to claims that it had gotten too expensive during the ongoing inflationary period. Its release should spike sales and are expected to produce profits at the same time.\n\nThose factors suggest McDonald\u2019s should rebound in the short term. It still plans to grow rapidly in the near future and the company wants to reach 50,000 global locations by 2027. If McDonald\u2019s achieves that goal it will be the fastest period of expansion in company history.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing in growth stocks is compelling, especially if one can handle the volatility associated with such assets compared to more conservative options. With recent data indicating a softening in inflation, the Federal Reserve is gearing up for a rate cut in the latter half of this year. This potential shift is the right time to closely monitor the growth stocks to watch, as a broader market surge would favor such dynamic investments.\n\nWall Street analysts have identified three stocks that should experience impressive growth. These three stocks are among the best investment opportunities for any savvy investor as they are ideal for delivering high returns because of their strength in their respective industries. This excellence also enhances their prospects of outperforming the market competition.\n\nGiven that the financial structure is in a transitional phase, these are the three growth stocks to watch for explosive growth. This makes it an ideal time to capture the uptrend.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is greatly advancing in futuristic fields like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, making it a stable choice among other growth stocks. AI is completely integrated into all its services and has revamped its functioning significantly, especially in its Azure cloud business.\n\nThis division reported a solid 31% revenue growth in the third quarter of 2024, drawing more sizable enterprises to its platform. Notably, over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies now utilize Azure\u2019s AI models. Thus, I believe Microsoft will continue outperforming its cloud industry competitors.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft reported a 17.1% increase in revenue and a 20% upswing in net income year-over-year. Additionally, with an astounding 35.5% net profit margin, Microsoft demonstrates a perfect harmony of growth and operational efficiency.\n\nWall Street analysts further bolster Microsoft\u2019s robust position, with a consensus \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating and an expected 10% price boost. This sentiment highlights confidence in Microsoft\u2019s ongoing momentum and market leadership.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is enhancing its e-commerce platform to offer more robust services to businesses of all sizes. The company\u2019s multifaceted revenue streams, including subscriptions, payment processing and shipping labels have fueled rapid growth.\n\nShopify surpassed revenue expectations in Q1 with a stellar $1.9 billion, a 23% bump YOY. This includes $1.4 billion from Merchant solutions and the rest from subscription services, which is quite balanced as Shopify targets mainly e-commerce merchants.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also marked a significant change in the company\u2019s financial status, where the operating income went up from negative $193 million to $86 million annually. Although the 4.5% margin is modest, it represents a crucial step towards making a profit.\n\nWall Street analysts are upbeat about Shopify\u2019s prospects, offering a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and projecting a remarkable 15.6% upside potential. Considering the stock\u2019s double-digit dip in the past six months, now presents a golden opportunity for investors to acquire shares at a lower price.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is changing the face of consumer finance and payment systems. Having evolved remarkably from a simple fintech firm, the company has achieved great milestones in the blockchain space, thus attracting Wall Street\u2019s attention.\n\nDespite its post-pandemic performance challenges, analysts are optimistic and predict a mind-boggling 40% surge from its current value.\n\nThe company showed superb performance and flexibility in Q1 2024. As for the peer-to-peer payment application Cash App, gross profit increased by 25% YOY and clocked in at $1.26 billion. Also, Square\u2019s merchant solutions were up 19% to $820 million, which shows steady growth in user adoption and usage of the products.\n\nFurthermore, Block\u2019s financial position has improved drastically, with net income escalating more than fourfold to $472 million in the previous year and adjusted EBITDA almost doubling to $705 million. This impressive turnaround positions Block as a top contender among growth stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We all know that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top choice among for investors looking at chip stocks in this market. However, this company is far from the only company that stands to benefit from AI-related tailwinds and surging long-term demand expectations.\n\nPlenty of other chip stocks have emerged as beneficiaries of the recent hype. And as AI technology improves daily, more infrastructure is needed to support the developers and corporations building the applications.\n\nFor those looking at mega-cap chip stocks, and other related companies that could benefit from these trends, examine three stocks worth keeping an eye on now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a leader in IT solutions for AI, Cloud, Storage and 5G/Edge, is expanding in Silicon Valley to meet rising demand for liquid-cooled data centers. The goal of the company\u2019s new campuses is to streamline global delivery of plug-and-play liquid-cooled solutions. This will enhance AI workload capabilities while cutting energy use and operational costs significantly.\n\nThe management team continues to emphasize SMCI\u2019s cutting-edge generative deep learning and AI inference platforms, enhanced by liquid-cooled technology. With rising interest in energy-efficient Direct Liquid-Cooled solutions, Super Micro Computer to innovates with its modular systems for AI and HPC industries. The company foresees liquid-cooled data centers increasing from historically minimal levels to 15%\u201330% of all installations within two years. This will position SMCI as a leader with superior efficiency and lower operational expenses versus conventional air-cooled setups.\n\nThe company saw its stock price soar nearly fourfold in the past year on strong growth in data center products. In Q3 of 2024, revenue reached $3.9 billion and net income $402 million. For Q4 of 2024, the market expects a $5.1 billion revenue, with a full year revenue projection of $14.7 billion.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) An AMD sign on a CPU package. AMD Stock\n\nSource: Tobias Arhelger / Shutterstock.com\n\nChallenging Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) comes in second in the AI chip market. AMD is also turning into a giant AI semiconductor company. It is gaining trust from other big tech companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This led to an 80% increase in data center revenue last March. The growth stems from an emerging AI product lineup.\n\nRecently, AMD launched its MI325X AI accelerator chip, offering 30% more bandwidth and double the memory of comparable Nvidia products. AMD plans to match Nvidia\u2019s pace in releasing next-gen AI tech.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf tempted to buy shares of this underappreciated growth company, down over 30% from its March high, analysts support your choice. With a consensus price target of $190.02\u201420% above the current price\u201435 of 49 analysts rate it a strong buy. Expect volatility and potentially more downside, but the company\u2019s long-term potential remains promising. I think at current levels, AMD stock presents a significant opportunity.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother crucial AI player is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The company has enabled Nvidia to produce powerful chips. In fact, Nvidia\u2019s Hopper uses TSM\u2019s 4N process and its Blackwell AI processors will use the 4NP process. Aside from that, IntelCorporation (NASDAQ:INTC) plans to use TSM\u2019s 3mm line for their notebook processes.\n\nUnlike Nvidia, INTC manufactures its own chips. But, it has fallen behind in developing advanced ones, thus relying on TSMC. Advancing toward 2nm process nodes, Taiwan Semiconductor continues to see high demand from Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm and other mega-cap tech companies. This demand continues to spur high factory utilization rates. Further, it\u2019s likely continue to do so over the long-term.\n\nThe market expects more growth from TSM stock, projecting a 21% increase by 2029. The company\u2019s earning per share growth estimates are very optimistic, with analysts expecting a 23% and 25% increase for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Given the big potential in AI, Taiwan Semiconductor is a company long-term investors may want to consider right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nIn the first half of 2024, stocks leapfrogged the wall of worry to deliver another solid set of six-month returns, leading the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to a respectable 14.5% gain and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to an even loftier 18% win.\n\nIf history is a guide, stock seasonality still favors the bulls in July. In fact, the Nasdaq has closed green in 10 of the past 11 Julys.\n\nThis bullishness extends into full-year results as well.\n\nLooking back to 1928, there have been 29 years when the S&P 500 was up 10% or more at the halfway mark. By year-end, the average gain was 24%. S&P 500 Monthly Returns When January to June Up More Than 10%\n\nIn each of the prior 12 instances of strong starts to the year going back to 1988, the second half of the year closed positive.\n\nAnd across all years in the group going back to 1928, the second and third quarters combined were up an average 6.1% (9.6% median) \u2014 and were green 76% of the time.\n\nAmid all these bullish results, two October stock market crashes \u2014 one in 1929 and one in 1987 \u2014 paved the way for the two worst-performing second halves of the year in the set, down 21.7% and 18.7%, respectively.\n\nWhile July sports a respectable 1.4% average return (2.3% median), the percentage of years with positive returns drops to 59% from 83% the month prior.\n\nThe monthly seasonal pattern turns from lackluster in August \u2014 with a 0.4% average gain and 52% loss rate \u2014 to outright negative average returns in September and October (though median results remain positive).\n\nFinally, after three months of roughly sideways tendencies, bullish tailwinds reaccelerate from November into year-end \u2014 just in time for the Santa Claus rally.\n\nIn general, historical seasonality patterns only account for up to a third of price returns. Big, unexpected catalysts can quickly tip the scales the other direction \u2014 so we can only outline tendencies. But it so happens that stock seasonality studies have generally worked well in this bull market, despite the AI moment seeming sui generis. S&P 500 Seasonality \u2014 1928 to 2023 First 10 Days and Last 10 Days of Each Month\n\nSeparately, BofA studied the first and last 10 trading days of each month going back to 1928 and found that the beginning of July has the highest average of any period (up 1.5% with positive results 69% of the time), another pattern to watch for this month.\n\nPutting it all together, we might expect some more strength in early July before the traditional election market patterns take over.\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

While most dividend-paying corporations raise their dividends\u00a0each year, some of those growth rates regularly exceed inflation. Luckily, it\u2019s been getting easier to beat inflation.

On top of that, some of these same corporations end up outperforming the stock market in the long run.\u00a0It pays to beat inflation, and you\u00a0don\u2019t have to invest in speculative assets to achieve that objective.\n\nWondering\u00a0which stocks are beating inflation with their dividends?

The average price target suggests\u00a0that the\u00a0stock can gain an additional 12% from current levels.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s financials suggest the dividend can continue to grow for a long time. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal\u00a02024 while net income jumped by 20% year-over-year.\u00a0Microsoft Cloud is driving more than half of the company\u2019s growth, but it also has respectable growth in\u00a0segments like\u00a0gaming, social media, advertising, and business software.\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0only has\u00a0a 0.67% yield,\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years.\u00a0Last year, Microsoft\u00a0raised its quarterly dividend from $0.68 per share to $0.75 per share, marking a 10.3% year-over-year increase. Microsoft is due to announce another dividend hike this September.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is just one of the credit and debit card issuers\u00a0that you\u00a0will find on this list.\u00a0Few companies are as well positioned to beat inflation\u00a0as\u00a0credit and debit card companies.\u00a0As inflation rises, people will spend\u00a0a little\u00a0more money on their cards. Companies like Visa collect a small percentage of every transaction. If transaction sizes increase due to inflation, Visa\u2019s earnings also increase due to inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have seen this trend play out for several quarters, including\u00a0in\u00a0Q2 FY24 results. Visa reported 10% year-over-year growth rates for revenue and GAAP net income in that quarter. GAAP earnings per share increased by 12% year-over-year to\u00a0reach\u00a0$2.29 per share. Visa also allocated $3.8 billion to stock buybacks and dividend distributions in the quarter.\n\nThe fintech firm offers a 0.79% yield and a double-digit growth rate.\u00a0Visa\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share\u00a0near the end of 2023. That\u2019s\u00a0a 15.6% year-over-year increase that comfortably exceeds the rate of inflation.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) serves more than one million businesses which gives it plenty of revenue streams. The company also offers an essential service\u00a0\u2014\u00a0business supplies and safety equipment. Many businesses need safety equipment and supplies to operate smoothly and remain compliant. If a business lacks these resources,\u00a0it\u2019s possible that the business cannot\u00a0operate.\n\nDividend growth and long-term returns haven\u2019t been an issue for this firm. Cintas hiked its quarterly dividend from $1.15 to $1.35 per share last year, representing a 17.4% year-over-year increase.\u00a0Cintas made that dividend hike last year,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0due to announce another one this month.\u00a0Shares are up by 18% year-to-date and have almost tripled over the past five years.\n\nCintas recently delivered 9.9% year-over-year revenue growth and a 22.0% jump in net income in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024.

It\u2019s only using a small percentage of retained earnings to reward investors.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts like what they see with the stock.\u00a0The average price target suggests a 19% upside. Mastercard stock\u00a0is currently rated\u00a0as a\u00a0Strong Buy among 24 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share\u00a0suggests\u00a0that Mastercard can gain an additional 25%.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc.

        "title": "Microsoft\u00a0AI Deal With UAE\u2019s G42 at Risk Over National Security Fears",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- In May, Microsoft Corp. and G42, the United Arab Emirates artificial intelligence firm, announced plans to spend $1 billion on projects in Kenya, including a massive geothermal-powered data center. The deal was negotiated with input from the US and UAE governments and coincided with a summit meeting in Washington between President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDemocrats Weigh Mid-July Vote to Formally Tap Biden as Nominee Trump Immunity Ruling Means Any Trial Before Election Unlikely Beryl Becomes Earliest Ever Category 5 Hurricane in Atlantic \u2018Upflation\u2019 Is the Latest Retail Trend Driving Up Prices for US Consumers Trump Isn't Going to Like the Supreme Court's Immunity Decision\n\nProponents of the Kenya project see it as a potential blueprint for similar government-business partnerships that could help the US expand its political and economic clout in the Global South \u2014 emerging markets in Africa and Central Asia where China is already firmly entrenched. Microsoft and G42 have pledged to team up on multiple projects in coming years, leveraging the UAE\u2019s regional ties.\n\nBut already there\u2019s growing concern in Washington that relying on Microsoft, G42 and the Emirati government could imperil national security \u2014 and without US officials on board, the firms won\u2019t be able to get the technology they need to make their partnership a success.\n\nThe linchpin of the two companies\u2019 relationship is an agreement, blessed earlier this year by the Biden administration, for Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in the UAE firm in exchange for G42\u2019s agreement to cut ties with Chinese companies. Pentagon officials are skeptical G42 will entirely uncouple from China, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s chronic cybersecurity failures, enumerated recently in a scathing government report, also have stoked fears that foreign powers could access sensitive US networks. Other officials wonder if it\u2019s a good idea shipping advanced AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\n\nThe most immediate question is whether to approve shipments to the Middle East of Nvidia Corp.\u2019s H100 chips, semiconductors used in AI data centers. Some officials have come to see the issue as tantamount to nuclear proliferation, with Nvidia chips as the most desired weapon in an AI arms race.\n\nWhile the Biden administration hashes out a broader regional strategy, it has slowed license approvals for high-volume AI chip shipments to the entire Gulf. It\u2019s unclear whether those approvals will be granted, but US officials are hoping to reach a consensus in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe resistance to the G42-Microsoft deal could hinder the administration\u2019s efforts to help US companies grab a global lead in the development of artificial intelligence, which is already emerging as the next front in Washington\u2019s Cold War with Beijing. US officials want to make sure that American firms \u2014 not their Chinese rivals \u2014 benefit from Gulf states\u2019 ambitions to fund and build big AI projects. By dangling the promise of access to American technology, they hope to persuade Middle Eastern states to sever ties to Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the National Security Council and Department of Commerce, and US national security will continue to be a principal priority,\u201d Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Pentagon, Commerce and G42 declined to comment. The NSC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe US government has long partnered with big business to extend America\u2019s geopolitical reach. And the Biden administration is no exception \u2014 touting a series of so-called economic corridors that promise local jobs and investment.\n\nSo far, these efforts mostly pale in comparison to Chinese investments in developing countries. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, US officials have gone all but silent on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor \u2014 an effort to link the emerging industrial powers of South Asia with Europe. Biden also has trumpeted the Lobito Corridor, a rail project through the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Angola, but the policy has been criticized for echoing Chinese efforts and focusing on resource extraction rather than sustainable business.\n\nOf the various efforts so far, the deal that Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo worked on with the Emiratis, Microsoft and G42 holds the most promise \u2014 if Washington can find a way to get comfortable with it. The UAE has the money and ties to the Global South. Microsoft has the technology and, in President Brad Smith, a kind of corporate secretary of state who has developed relationships around the globe. G42\u2019s Khazna division, a subsidiary that has built data centers in the UAE, is now expanding across Africa and Asia.\n\nKenya is a logical place to establish a foothold. With its fast-growing, youthful and increasingly tech-savvy population, the East African nation has emerged as a rival tech hub to Nigeria and South Africa. Nicknamed Silicon Savannah, Kenya has a vibrant startup ecosystem and is home to M-Pesa, a thriving fintech company that provides mobile financial services.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Smith says the nation reminds him of Southeast Asia in the early 1990s. \u201cYou see this enormous potential,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important to the United States. China recognizes that as well.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Biden named veteran tech executive Meg Whitman US ambassador to Kenya. The former Hewlett-Packard chief quickly established herself as a bridge between Kenyan officials and US tech leaders, last year accompanying President Ruto on a tour of Silicon Valley, with stops at Google and Apple Inc. In May, Google announced plans to build an undersea fiber-optic cable connecting Australia to Kenya and six other African nations.\n\nStill, operating in Kenya is challenging. Last month, protests forced Ruto to withdraw a law that would have raised taxes to help stabilize the country\u2019s finances. Kenyans stormed the National Assembly, chanting \u201cRuto Must Go,\u201d and as many as two dozen people were killed when the police opened fire. Ruto\u2019s reversal means Kenya will now struggle to balance its budget and pay its creditors.\n\nCorruption is endemic. Money laundering is an issue. And the US Treasury recently sanctioned a number of Kenyan entities for their links to terrorist funding. The country is also struggling to build out its physical infrastructure, including adequate roads and transport systems, water and power capacity. A State Department spokesperson said the US is working closely with the Kenyan government to \u201ccreate a business-friendly environment,\u201d and encourages companies to embrace opportunities there.\n\nCompeting with China, let alone dislodging it, won\u2019t be easy. As part of Beijing\u2019s Digital Silk Road effort, Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. have long targeted the Global South, dangling state-backed loans, discounted hardware, training and technical help. Huawei has played a key role in helping to build and fund a $14.5 billion \u201csmart city\u201d in Kenya called Konza Technopolis.\n\nMany African nations have based their IT systems on Chinese standards for digital data, a regulatory environment Microsoft could struggle to navigate, according to Olena Borodyna, a senior geopolitical risks advisor for ODI, a global affairs think tank. The company also could be outmaneuvered by Chinese firms that have spent years doing business there. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like selling a Tesla in Kenya or Uzbekistan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see Chinese cars. You don\u2019t see many Teslas. It\u2019s the same story in digital infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe key advantage the US has over China \u2014 for the moment \u2014 is a distinct lead in cloud computing and the large language models undergirding AI. But much will depend on Washington\u2019s willingness to deploy the technology.\n\n\u201cIn a place like the UAE, where you have G42 working very closely with Huawei, for example, we have an interest in changing that picture,\u201d Tarun Chhabra, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for technology, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in late June. \u201cWe see the effort to work with Microsoft as an alternative to Huawei as generally a positive development \u2014 and one that we want to encourage.\u201d However, he also said it will take time to transition from \u201can untrusted vendor.\u201d\n\nThe US curbed the sale of advanced chips and semiconductor equipment to China in 2022, and added much of the Gulf region to that framework last year. Commerce Department officials have been talking with their counterparts in the UAE and other affected countries about the export license process for high-end chips including Nvidia\u2019s, as well as strategies to safeguard sensitive technology, people familiar with the situation have said. G42\u2019s chairman, UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, discussed the matter during a visit to Washington and Seattle in early June, other people said.\n\nThe US government\u2019s licensing decision hinges in part on how well Microsoft and G42 can secure the chips once they\u2019re in the data centers. One possibility is that Microsoft will put the most sensitive technology in a restricted-access area, something the company has done before. Others have thrown out ideas like putting a kill switch on the Nvidia chips, according to several people familiar with the conversations, or having the entire operation remotely controlled from the US. Microsoft has also pledged to follow so-called know-your-customer rules to determine who is using its data centers, and won\u2019t allow Chinese customers to train their models.\n\nAll of this is predicated on G42 removing Chinese gear from its supply chains. In recent months, the company hired a third-party auditor to determine whether it\u2019s abiding by those terms, several people said, prompting some US officials to worry that the large sum G42 is paying amounts to a conflict of interest. Asked how the US will enforce such agreements, the NSC\u2019s Chhabra said it will \u201cvary by context.\u201d That could mean direct diplomatic talks, he said, or it might include a push from a \u201cUS vendor that itself is going to want those assurances \u2014 because they generally want to continue working with the US government.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a growing feeling on Capitol Hill that the Microsoft-G42 deal needs congressional oversight. Several bipartisan staff delegations have visited the UAE in recent weeks, according to a House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican staffer who was briefed on the trips, with more outreach to come. The goal, the staffer said, is to make the UAE cognizant of growing concerns in Washington \u2014 and make clear that they need to honor their commitments, whatever they may be.\n\n--With assistance from Loni Prinsloo, Michelle Jamrisko, Kate O'Keeffe and Olivia Solon.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before Online Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America Japan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The market for clinical software alone is expected to increase by $2.76 billion from 2023 to 2028, according to Technavio.\n\nPractitioners, meanwhile, are preparing for the potential technological revolution.\n\nSneha Jain, a chief fellow at Stanford University's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, said that AI has the potential to become as integrated with the healthcare system as the internet while also stressing the importance of using the technology responsibly.\n\n\u201cPeople want to err on the side of caution because in the oath of becoming a doctor and for healthcare providers, it\u2019s first: Do no harm,\u201d Jain told Yahoo Finance. \u201cSo how do we make sure that we first do no harm while also really pushing forward and advancing the way AI is used in healthcare?\u201d\n\nPotential patients seem wary: A recent Deloitte Consumer Health Care survey found that 30% of respondents stated they \"don't trust the information\" provided by generative AI for healthcare, compared to 23% a year ago.\n\nThe fear: 'Garbage in, garbage out'\n\nPatients seem to have reason to doubt AI's current capabilities.\n\nA study published in May evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs), which interpret media like images and videos, found that AI models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4V performed worse in medical settings than random guessing when asked questions regarding medical diagnosis.\n\n\"These findings underscore the urgent need for robust evaluation methodologies to ensure the reliability and accuracy of LMMs in medical imaging,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nDr. Safwan Halabi, vice chair of imaging informatics at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, highlighted the trust issues surrounding the implementation of these models by comparing the use of AI in healthcare without testing to the use of self-driving cars without conducting proper test drives.

If a model was trained using health data about Caucasians in Northern California, he said, it may not be able to provide appropriate and accurate care to African Americans on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n\"The data is only as good as its source, and so the concern is garbage in, garbage out,\" Halabi told Yahoo Finance. He added that \"good medicine is slow medicine\" and stressed the importance of safety tests before putting the technology into practice.\n\nBut others, like Dr. John Halamka, president of the technology initiative Mayo Clinic Platform, emphasized AI\u2019s potential to leverage the expertise of millions of doctors.\n\n\u201cWouldn't you like the experience of millions and millions of patient journeys to be captured in a predictive algorithm so that a clinician could say, 'Well, yes, I have my training and my experience, but can I leverage the patients of the past to help me treat patients of the future in the best possible way?'\u201d Halamka told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCreating guardrails\n\nFollowing an executive order signed by President Biden last year to develop policies that would advance the technology while managing risks, Halamka and other researchers have argued for standardized, agreed-upon principles to assess AI models for bias, among other concerns.\n\n\u201cAI, whether predictive or generative, is math not magic,\" Halamka said. \"We recognize the need to build a public-private collaboration, bringing government, academia, and industry together to create the guardrails and the guidelines so that anyone who is doing healthcare and AI has a way of measuring: Well, is this fair? Is it appropriate? Is it valid? Is it effective? Is it safe?\u201d\n\nThey also stressed the need for a national network of assurance laboratories \u2014 spaces to test the validity and ethics of AI models. Jain is at the center of these discussions, as she's starting one such laboratory at Stanford.\n\n\"The regulatory environment, the cultural environment, and the technical environment are ripe for this kind of progress on how to think about assurance and safety for AI, so it's an exciting time,\" she said.

The company, through its partnership with OpenAI, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence rally that has powered the US stock market higher.\n\nMore than 90% of Ballmer\u2019s $157.2 billion net worth is in Microsoft shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Gates, meanwhile, has diversified his $156.7 billion fortune: About half his wealth is held through Cascade Investment, which was created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. He also owns a $21 billion stake in waste-management company Republic Services Inc. through Cascade.\n\nGates, 68, has been slowly reducing his fortune through philanthropy. Along with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates and his friend Warren Buffett, Gates has funneled billions of dollars of his personal money to build up the $75 billion Gates Foundation, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world.\n\nSince they started the foundation more than two decades ago, Gates and his former wife have given almost $60 billion from their personal fortunes. French Gates recently stepped down as co-chair of the foundation and received $12.5 billion to use for her own charitable purposes.\n\nIn 2010, Gates, French Gates and Buffett also founded the Giving Pledge, an organization that encourages the world\u2019s richest people to give away the majority of their fortunes in their lifetimes or their wills. Ballmer, 68, who has not signed the Giving Pledge, has his own philanthropic work but nowhere on the scale of Gates.\n\nGates founded Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in 1975 and led it until 2000, when Ballmer \u2014 one of the company\u2019s earliest employees \u2014 replaced him as CEO.

        "content": "Budget-friendly stocks are increasingly hard to find as top-performing mega-caps edge ever closer to overvaluation. And, as we\u2019ve seen with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) over the past week, even moderate underperformance can be devastating when so much of the wider market hinges on their performance.\n\nBut a handful of budget-friendly stocks are floating in the ether, even if we must reevaluate how we define those budget-friendly stocks. In some cases, they\u2019re purely undervalued \u2014 even if per-share pricing seems high. In other cases, they\u2019re cheap enough to fall within penny stock territory without all the baggage associated with penny stocks. Of course, the sweet spot for budget-friendly stocks is right in the middle: priced low enough that buying a handful of shares won\u2019t break the bank while also offering some material undervaluation, whether based on current fundamentals or projected future performance.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY)\n\nSource: Nintendo\n\nNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) is perennially on my list of budget-friendly stocks for a handful of reasons. Primarily, the Japanese company does business better \u2014 in my mind \u2014 than most public American companies. Specifically, while most U.S.-based public companies fight quarter-to-quarter, Nintendo always keeps the long game in mind rather than squeezing every cent of profit from customers on a short-term basis that ultimately proves devastating long-term. Perhaps that\u2019s why Nintendo has been around since 1889 and continues thriving!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor proof of the company\u2019s commitment to long-term excellence, look at its balance sheet \u2014 Nintendo consistently keeps ton of cash on hand with zero debt, providing it a sizable war chest to weather economic uncertainty and take advantage of new opportunities. In fact, a massive cash balance is one of the reasons Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) execs saw Nintendo as ripe for acquisition in 2020. While the buyout didn\u2019t pan out, Microsoft clearly saw Nintendo as one of the best budget-friendly stocks in the market. Little has changed since then, inroads into greater intellectual property utilization that could be yet another cash cow for the budget-friendly gaming stock.\n\nPSQ Holdings (PSQH) The fa\u00e7ade of the New York Stock Exchange is decorated for the listing of PublicSq (PSQH) via a SPAC with Colombier Acquisition Corp.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the much more speculative side of the equation, PSQ Holdings (NYSE:PSQH) trades in penny stock territory at around $3.75 per share and a market cap of just $110 million. But the former SPAC\u2019s small size shouldn\u2019t dissuade you \u2014 PSQ Holdings is at the forefront of emerging eCommerce trends, which I think will be huge over the next few years.\n\nStory continues\n\nPSQ Holdings\u2019 primary property is the digital PublicSquare marketplace, which affirms a commitment to \u201chelp consumers \u2018shop their values\u2019 and put purpose behind their purchases.\u201d For now, don\u2019t let the company\u2019s conservative leanings factor into the equation, no matter which side of the political spectrum you fall on. Instead, look to what PSQ\u2019s ethos represents and how that could transform eCommerce.\n\nSocial media\u2019s increased atomization of our online experience means we\u2019re often trapped in a similarly-minded networked ecosystem \u2014 if you want to be charitable \u2014 and an echo chamber if not. It only makes sense that many would prefer to shop the same way: by picking an eCommerce market that aligns with their values, no matter what they are, and that they can feel good supporting. Factor in the fact that Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) offerings are of increasingly poor overseas quality, and many find PublicSquare\u2019s emphasis on American-made goods even more appealing.\n\nUltimately, I think PSQ Holdings stands out among budget-friendly stocks for what it represents as much as its cheap per-share pricing. Considering it\u2019s a relative newcomer to stock exchanges, I see lots of upside in the company\u2019s future.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike PSQ Holdings, I see Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of our budget-friendly stocks because of its long-term potential rather than its current pricing or valuation. First, of course, is the \u201ckey man\u201d issue negation as Musk\u2019s pay package panned out. This, of course, cements his focus on Tesla and, no matter how you feel about the man, means that Tesla will benefit from increased personal emphasis on its performance.\n\nThat\u2019s already evident just weeks after the decision as we\u2019re seeing Musk shift his AI emphasis back toward Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is building a massive GPU warehouse to position more than 50,000 Nvidia GPUs in a bid to realign AI development under the Tesla umbrella. This comes on the heels of Tesla\u2019s announced $3 \u2013 $4 billion AI hardware expenditure, showing that Musk and Tesla are serious about asserting their position as AI leaders. Improved AI will go a long way toward addressing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d which, in turn, is effectively the last remaining hurdle toward full self-driving car capability.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) saw a surge in viewership last week, drawing a diverse audience for the Presidential Debate. The platform\u2019s ability to attract viewers interested in both the debate and their favorite pundits\u2019 opinions sets it apart from alternatives like YouTube. Likewise, its unique user base and content moderation outlook make Rumble a standout among budget-friendly stocks for similar reasons to PSQ Holdings: it captures increased atomization of the Internet. It capitalizes on the trend of scaling the \u201c1,000 True Fans\u201d marketing theory that\u2019s increasingly taking hold among forward-looking companies.\n\nWhile Rumble is not yet a major competitor to YouTube, its growth trajectory is promising. Despite a slight dip in first-quarter monthly active users compared to 2023 highs, Rumble maintains a steady global MAU count above 50 million.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Rumble posted a $0.14 loss per share per share, outperforming analyst expectations of a $0.22. Additionally, Rumble has boldly filed an antitrust lawsuit againstGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The lawsuit accuses Google of unfair online advertising practices that favor YouTube over competitors like Rumble. Although the lawsuit\u2019s uncertain outcome makes it a risky move, it also positions Rumble as a formidable underdog among budget-friendly stocks.\n\nStem (STEM) Illustration of robot hand reaching for the letters \"AI\" with tech symbols around it.

Financially, the company reduced total debt by 15%, saving costs in today\u2019s high-interest-rate environment.

        "content": "Retirement stocks are something every investor needs to look into, and when deciding on which retirement stocks to buy, you can never go wrong with Dividend Kings, S&P 500 index constituents that have raised their dividends every one of the previous 25 straight years.\n\nDividend growers had 11.7% compound annual returns from 1986 to 2016, while dividend payers had 9.9%. Dividend stocks are more resilient, so this outperformance is even greater during market volatility. This is great, since the markets are still not in full on recovery mode; persistent inflation means there is only one rate cut this year, further demonstrating where we sit.\n\nHowever, recent evidence confirms dividend stocks\u2019 better performance. Dividend stocks exceeded bonds in absolute gains during the last decade. The iShares Select Dividend ETF (NASDAQ:DVY) has returned 8.66% annually, compared to the aggregate bond index\u2019s 1.5%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, a limited handful of highly performing mega-cap stocks\u2014often driven by industries like technology\u2014have made major contributions to the larger market. Look no further than Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) going pastMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable company thanks to an AI boom.\n\nDividend companies, especially those in the value range, provide a convincing prospect for investors as the earnings growth difference between these leaders and the rest of the market closes. More importantly, they also give you a valuation advantage when researching retirement stocks.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend King AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has raised rewards over the last 52 years. It is one of the best healthcare retirement investments. Its dividend of 3.53% is substantially higher than the 1.5% average for the health industry, even with the loss of its Humira patent.\n\nHumira and its purchase of Botox producer Allergan are AbbVie\u2019s most well-known products. Humira lost its U.S. exclusivity last year, but AbbVie is making up for the revenue loss with the addition of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\n\nOn top of this, AbbVie started a Phase 3 trial for the multiple myeloma therapy ABBV-383. This experimental medication targets BCMA, found in plasma cells from multiple myeloma.\n\nAdditionally, under a worldwide licensing agreement with FutureGen Biopharmaceutical, AbbVie is developing FG-M701, a next-generation TL1A antibody for inflammatory bowel disease. This collaboration highlights the immunology and autoimmune therapy development of AbbVie.\n\nFor several cancer treatments, Elahere was granted full FDA clearance; for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, it was given an Epkinly Priority Review. Good outcomes were obtained for atopic dermatitis with Rinvoq in the SELECT-GCA trial and the LEVEL UP trial comparing Rinvoq to Dupixent.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the financial front, citing operating progress, the business increased its 2024 adjusted diluted EPS estimate from $10.97-$11.17 to $11.13-$11.33. Up 285% since 2013, AbbVie has paid a $1.55 cash dividend per share, continuing on its legacy of shareholder value, placing it well among retirement stocks.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in retirement stocks generally begins with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Seniors wanting a dependable income may consider the company\u2019s medicines, medical devices, and consumer health products activities, particularly because shares are down more than 8% since the start of the year due to a mixed quarterly report and narrower full-year expectations.\n\nHowever, analysts expect JNJ to rebound. Most analysts rank the business \u201cModerate Buy,\u201d with a $176 12-month target. Strategic purchases like Ambrx Biopharma and Shockwave Medical suggest a 20% gain.\n\nJohnson & Johnson acquired clinical-stage biopharma company Ambrx Biopharma. The purchase boosts J&J\u2019s oncology pipeline, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ADC research.\n\nJ&J acquired intravascular lithotripsy leaderShockwave Medical to treat complicated calcified arterial disease. Due to J&J\u2019s position in high-growth nations with unmet requirements, the transaction may improve revenue.\n\nFinancially, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s first-quarter revenues grew 2.3% to $21.4 billion; improved MedTech and Innovative Medicine fostered this rise. The business also announced regulatory clearances for TECVAYL, RYBREVANT, and DARZALEX.\n\nEssential Utilities (WTRG) the interior of a water utility processing plant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is down around 7% over the past year, with the latest quarterly earnings report contributing to the somewhat dampened sentiment; WTRG topped analyst estimates of $0.77 with $0.97 EPS. With quarterly revenues of $612.07 million, the firm fell short of its $750.08 million projection. Regulated natural gas operating income were below projections due to warmer-than-average temperatures.\u200b\n\nMostly in controlled water, the company intends to invest $1.3 to $1.4 billion in 2024 and $7.2 billion by 2028 in infrastructure.\n\nFor 79 years the corporation has paid quarterly dividends; in 32 years, the payment has been raised 33 times. In June, WTRG announced a $0.3071 quarterly cash dividend, 7% more than the prior year.\n\nEssential Utilities is expanding by buying other businesses. WTRG is signing six agreements for new wastewater systems in Pennsylvania and Illinois, serving more than 215,000 people. WTRG is also buying DELCORA for $276.5 million, a sewer authority serving 198,000 people in Philadelphia. The business wants to buy more businesses, which could bring in another 400,000 people.\n\nFinally, Essential Utilities\u2019 aims to cut Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035 are significant as ESG investment grows.

        "content": "The\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average has undergone many changes since its lengthy history. The index has been tracking 30 companies for more than a century, and recent changes have strengthened it. The Dow Jones has recently been kicking out underperforming stocks and replacing them with big tech companies.\n\nConcentrating on the Magnificent Seven stocks has been a winning formula for several years. There is a fund called the\u00a0Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS) that only has the Magnificent Seven stocks. It\u2019s up by 40% year-to-date and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this list will feature Magnificent Seven stocks. You don\u2019t have to fix what isn\u2019t broken. However, some non-Magnificent Seven stocks in the Dow Jones are worth your attention. These are some of the top Dow stocks to buy that patient investors should monitor for long-term returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been regularly crushing the stock market as it expands into numerous verticals. Shares are up by 22% year-to-date and have gained 238% over the past five years. Microsoft\u2019s recent gains come as the company perfectly positions itself for AI tailwinds. Copilot has strengthened Microsoft\u2019s product line and makes it easier to explore new industries. Microsoft Cloud is also a beneficiary of artificial intelligence since the technology requires significant computing power and storage.\n\nRevenue increased by 17% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Net income jumped by 20% year-over-year during the same timeframe. While Microsoft has many business segments, cloud computing is the most important component. Microsoft Cloud generated over half of the company\u2019s total revenue and grew by 23% year-over-year.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts are bullish about the stock\u2019s long-term prospects. Microsoft is rated as a\u00a0Strong Buy with a projected 11% upside from current levels.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another Magnificent Seven stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is worth your attention. The tech conglomerate makes up roughly 3.25% of the price-weighted Dow Jones. Shares have picked up momentum recently and are up by 32% year-to-date. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and briefly touched a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company is also primed to benefit from cloud computing through Amazon Web Services. This segment generated $25.0 billion in revenue,\u00a0up 17% year-over-year. Amazon accumulated $143.3 billion in\u00a0Q1 2024 revenue,\u00a0which\u00a0is 13% higher than last year\u2019s revenue. Online marketplace sales achieved double-digit growth rates in domestic and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is a leader in multiple verticals that should continue to grow.\u00a0Advertising, streaming, gaming and\u00a0grocery shopping\u00a0are some industries in\u00a0which Amazon is a top player.\u00a0The tech conglomerate has multiple ways to expand its revenue.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is the only stock on this list that isn\u2019t a member of the Magnificent Seven. The fintech firm still holds its weight with a 21% year-to-date gain and an 85% 5-year gain. Unlike most fintech firms, American Express still trades at a reasonable valuation. Shares are valued at a 19 P/E ratio and have a 1.23% yield. American Express has regularly maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years, suggesting that cash flow will continue to grow.\n\nThe financial company is poised to withstand economic uncertainty since people always use their credit and debit cards for expenses. These cards are more convenient than cash and come with great rewards, such as cash or points back on every purchase. Revenue and earnings growth are still strong, with those metrics improving by 11% and 34% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter.\n\nMore than 60% of new account openings came from millennials and Gen Z consumers, indicating that American Express is winning over younger generations. Appealing to the next generations is a critical component of companies that survive and thrive for decades and eventually centuries.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT and AMZN.

        "content": "I\u2019ve got a surprising fact for you:\n\nNew technologies are often astonishingly S\u2026 L\u2026 O\u2026 W\u2026 to take off.\n\nIn 1950, there were only 25 million registered vehicles in America, or one for every six people. Though Henry Ford had introduced the Model T more than four decades earlier, many families still saw no reason to buy a car.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s because, besides \u201cworking,\u201d cars \u2014 like all new technologies \u2014 needed three other ingredients to succeed:\n\nInfrastructure. Cars need roads, gas stations and service centers. Culture. People must want to drive. Incentives. Car-friendly regulations need to be in place.\n\nIn the automobile\u2019s case, the technology required the National Highway System expansion of 1955, suburbanization and a rise of American car culture before it could truly take off. By 1970, there were 118 million cars on the road. By 1990, almost 200 million.\n\nThe automobile also illustrates how these three ingredients develop in phases. The Official Microsoft Blog calls December 20, 1922, \u201cThe Day the Horse Lost Its Job\u201d after New York City\u2019s last horse-drawn fire wagon was replaced with a motorized engine. Streetcar usage declined soon after, when motor cars began clogging up streets. It would take several more decades for railways to eventually succumb; between 1967 and 1972, six major railroads went bankrupt after competition from trucks and other intermodal transport options ate into profits.\n\nThe same was true for the fax machine, the personal computer and \u2026 even the internet. Infrastructure, culture and incentives are built in stages. That\u2019s why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u201cbeat\u201d booksellers decades ago, yet still has trouble competing against fresh grocers and big-box stores like Costco (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nToday, the same battle is taking shape with artificial intelligence.\n\nSome businesses will survive for decades against this new technology. Surgeons, structural engineers and hang-gliding instructors all work with life-or-death situations. So, while AI might enhance the jobs in the near term, it would take significant cultural and regulatory shifts to replace these positions with AI.\n\nBut other companies are already beginning to struggle. These firms are finding themselves on the wrong side of history\u2026 and are failing to mount a counteroffensive.\n\nThis week, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com consider three categories of firms \u2013 and nine stocks among them \u2013 that are especially exposed to \u201closing their job\u201d in these early days of artificial intelligence\u2026\n\nLow-End Content Creation: Where AI Will Hurt the Most A photo of a person's hands on a laptop keyboard. Several notebooks are on a desk surrounding the laptop.\n\nSource: Undrey / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lowest-hanging fruit for an AI takeover may be generic content creation \u2013 the stock imagery, clickbait articles and other low-quality content you see online.\n\nThat\u2019s because AI already has the three ingredients to compete:\n\nInfrastructure. AI-generated content is now often indistinguishable from generic human-created stuff. Culture. Consumers are becoming more accepting of low-quality AI-generated content. Incentives. Regulations around AI-generated content is lax, so companies have an incentive to cut costs by using AI.\n\nNBC, for instance, found it wise to launch an AI version of announcer Al Michaels to read sports recaps from the Paris 2024 Olympics. Similarly, here are three companies that could soon see their content-producing \u201cjobs\u201d replaced by AI:\n\nShutterstock (NYSE:SSTK). This week at InvestorPlace.com, Thomas Niel notes that Executive Chairman Jonathan Oringer is selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of shares into strength \u2013 a big red flag in his book. The company specializes in stock images and footage, which are at risk of being replaced by AI-generated content. IZEA Worldwide(NASDAQ:IZEA). InvestorPlace Chief Investment Analyst Luke Lango previously turned bearish on this content creation firm\u2026 in 2021. He saw how much trouble the firm\u2019s influencer-marketing-as-a-service was running into. Now, at InvestorPlace.com, we note how the firm is missing on earnings and revenues \u2013 a bearish sign of more losses to come. Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). In April, Ian Bezek noted that there were good reasons to be skeptical of Fiverr, an online marketplace for freelancers offering their services. He notes that AI will be able to perform many rudimentary tasks offered by Fiverr in coming years. A recent 20% price spike now gives investors an ideal window to take profits.\n\nMidtier Services: The Next to Fall A stack of open textbooks on a table in front of a chalkboard background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nProfessional services will be the next area to worry about. This segment still lacks some of the infrastructure required to turn AI into usable products. (Data collection remains a fragmented and incomplete industry, making it difficult to train specialized AI.) There\u2019s also a culture issue of relying on AI to do important (though nonessential) tasks. The IRS will probably reject \u201cAI did my taxes\u201d as a reason to waive tax penalties.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI grows \u201csmart\u201d enough to compete. Our analysts find two companies that are already seeing earnings drop as a result.\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG). Louis Navellier and his team note that Chegg is facing some critical problems due to the rise of artificial intelligence. Generative AI platforms are able to help students \u2013 and even do work for them \u2013 cutting into demand for the homework assistance and online tutoring services that Chegg provides. Earnings are expected to slide 8% this year. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU). Muslim Farooque warned in January that online education firm 2U was struggling with mounting debt costs and continuous cash burn. Shares have fallen 82% since that article. The rise of AI is now compounding this issue, because chatbots are increasingly able to tutor and help with homework. This month, 2U announced it will do a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which is a historic sign of more losses to come.\n\nCrowding Out: The Small Become Smaller a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, the rise of AI will favor larger tech companies with access to data and enough computing power to use it. To borrow the same automobile example from earlier, it\u2019s like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM) using its dominant positions in the 1920s and 1930s to develop more powerful and efficient engines, crowding out smaller players like Brewster, Durant Motors and hundreds of others.\n\nThat puts smaller firms at a disadvantage, as the writers at InvestorPlace.com note this month. AI is already consolidating some fragmented markets, and the trend will only continue as artificial intelligence widens this gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots.\u201d\n\nVeritone (NASDAQ:VERI). Muslim Farooque observes that this AI-powered media and advertising company is at the mercy of Amazon. Veritone relies on the tech giant for 30% of its sales, and its data intelligence offerings could be quickly eclipsed if the tech giant horizontally expands into the space. Viktor Zarev goes further and calls Veritone another generic AI service provider with no competitive moat. BigBear.ai Holdings (NYSE:BBAI). Ian Bezek writes how this AI data mining and analytics firm is losing significant contracts at a time when larger rivals are growing. \u201cStop and think about that for a minute,\u201d he notes in a recent update. \u201cIn the midst of the biggest imaginable AI boom possible, BigBear.ai\u2019s revenues plunged 22% over the past 12 months.\u201d The company competes directly against public cloud firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have far greater financial resources. SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN). Tyrik Torres calls SoundHound an overhyped stock to sell before it crashes and burns. He notes that the the company\u2019s product is \u201cnot very unique\u201d from what is already on the market, which puts it in direct competition with better-funded firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung, which have their own top-tier vocal-recognition software. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Finally, Louis Navellier and his team observe this week that Intel continues to fall behind rivals. \u201cAI and foundry growth revival is far from a near-certainty for INTC,\u201d they say. They see shares falling into the mid-$20s by 2025. Analysts predict the firm will only grow its research and development (R&D) budget in the low single-digits through 2027, right as rivals are upping their R&D spending by 60% or more annually.\n\nThe Internet\u2026 but 10X Bigger\n\nThe AI developments I\u2019ve been describing are exactly what happened with the internet in the early 2000s. Poorly run firms without the ability to adapt were the first to get wiped out. Service providers like travel agencies were next. Finally, smaller tech players disappeared as large internet firms took over.\n\nAnd almost all new technologies follow this same arc.\n\nBut major technologies and the investing mania that follow them don\u2019t come around very often\u2026 maybe once every generation. In fact, Louis Navellier is predicting that AI will be the last major financial mania that he or anyone over the age of 50 will see in time to capitalize on it.\n\nLouis talks about all that \u2013 plus what \u201cfinancial mania\u201d could lead to the rise of a \u201cNew America\u201d that\u2019ll be almost unrecognizable to anyone from our generation \u2013 in more detail in his brand-new special event, Prediction 2024.\n\nYou can check out that free event by going here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung owned shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Up 18.9% YTD on Cloud Strength: Time to Buy?",
        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has seen its stock price climb 18.9% year to date, outpacing the Zacks Computer \u2013 Software industry and S&P 500 index, which have returned 15.2% and 14.7%, respectively. This impressive performance can be largely attributed to the company's strong positioning in two key areas \u2014 cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\r\n\r\nMSFT projects a 15.2% net sales increase for fiscal 2024 that showcases the strength of its cloud-centric strategy. Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure, server products and enterprise services, generated a robust $26.7 billion in revenues, in the fiscal third quarter, marking a 21% year-over-year increase.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft expects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. Our model estimate for Intelligent Cloud revenues is currently pegged at $28.5 billion, indicating 19% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, we expect cloud services and AI innovations to remain a key growth driver for Microsoft.\n\nMSFT Stock Outperforms Industry & S&P 500 Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft's Cloud Engine Azure Propels Growth in Competitive Market\n\nAzure continues to be a major growth driver, demonstrating the sustained demand for cloud services across industries. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Azure and other cloud services revenues grew 31% year over year (up 31% at cc), including roughly 7 points from AI services.\r\n\r\nIn the global cloud infrastructure market, Azure has solidified its position as the second-largest provider, reaching a record 25% market share in the first quarter of 2024, according to Synergy Research Group. This narrows the gap with market leader Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (31%) while outpacing Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud (11%). The \"Big Three\" now control 67% of the expanding cloud sector.\r\n \r\nAzure Arc, Microsoft's hybrid cloud offering, has been a key differentiator among competitor offerings. It allows its customers DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods and World Bank to run Azure services across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up more than twofold year over year.\r\n\r\nMSFT\u2019s strategy of developing industry-specific cloud solutions, such as Azure for Healthcare and Azure for Financial Services, has proven effective in penetrating key verticals.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has become the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L\u2019Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure.\r\n\r\nBeyond Azure, Microsoft's cloud dominance extends to its analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric, which has attracted over 11,000 paid customers. The integration of Fabric with Azure AI Studio and Power BI showcases Microsoft's comprehensive approach to cloud services, now serving more than 350,000 paid customers across its ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAs digital transformation accelerates and demand for AI, machine learning and secure cloud solutions grows, Microsoft's Azure platform is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends, driving continued growth and innovation in the cloud computing space. In Azure, MSFT expects revenue growth at cc between 30% and 31% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAzure Leads Microsoft's AI Revolution\n\nMicrosoft's Azure platform is spearheading the company's AI-driven growth strategy. The integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 into Bing and Edge showcases Azure's capabilities in delivering advanced AI experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Azure OpenAI Service has become a pivotal tool for developers, facilitating the incorporation of generative AI across diverse applications. The collaboration with OpenAI on an advanced data center project further cements Azure's position as a leader in AI infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn the fiscal third quarter, the company reported impressive adoption of Azure AI, boasting over 53,000 customers, with more than a third being new to Azure in the past year. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service.\r\nMSFT continues to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open-source models, including large language models and small language models.\r\n\r\nMore than half of Azure AI customers use the company\u2019s data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB, with deep integrations with Azure AI.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's launch of AI-powered copilot templates for retailers demonstrates Azure's versatility in creating industry-specific solutions. These developments highlight Azure's central role in Microsoft's AI strategy, driving innovation and market expansion.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the promising long-term prospects, maintaining a position in Microsoft, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) appears prudent at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT\u2019s fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $244.41 billion, indicating 15.3% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $11.77, which has moved up by a penny in the past 60 days, indicating 20% growth year over year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMoreover, MSFT is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 13.59X compared with the industry\u2019s 9.42X and higher than the median of 11X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nMSFT\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHence, investors looking to buy the stock should rather wait for a better entry point.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A tough on the eyes presidential debate might've left viewers with more concern than confidence (or questions than answers), but there are still plenty of reasons investors should remain bullish on red-hot tech darlings such as Nvidia (NVDA).\n\n\u201cFrom a tech perspective, the political environment won\u2019t change that much under either [candidate],\" Goldman Sachs portfolio manager Brook Dane told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his \u2018Opening Bid\u2019 podcast (see video above or listen here).\n\nDane says a combination of ingrained bullish sentiment around tech stocks, and their strong outlook for profits and cash flow should deflect election concerns. AI companies are particularly shielded from political worries given how fast they are expanding, Dane added. President Joe Biden, right, and Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, left, during a presidential debate hosted by CNN, Thursday, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFormer president Donald Trump and current president Joe Biden left debate watchers stunned last week, with the former spewing falsehoods and the latter appearing frail and out of touch.\n\nPressing topics like tech regulation and the rising influence of AI remained on the back burner.\n\nTech investors noticed the lack of attention on said hot-button issues, and continued to stick with mega cap winner, largely because of the facts Dane laid out.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) recently climbed to a $3.34 trillion market cap, making it the world's most valuable company. Shares traded mostly sideways after the contentious first debate.\n\nApple (AAPL) shares barely budged \u2014it's only down slightly from its 52-week high of $220.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) held firm as well; it's down a hair from the record high it closed on June 27.\n\nRegardless of who wins, Dane acknowledges an environment of tighter scrutiny around social media companies and the relationship between the US and China.\n\nBut AI names could still do well. \u201cI think Washington in general is lagging behind understanding how profound this change is and how structural it is,\u201d he said.\n\nCalls from experts like Dane will be put to the test again soon.\n\nThe election cycle's next events include the Republican National Convention scheduled for July 15-18 in Milwaukee, the Democratic National Convention from August 19-22 in Chicago, and another presidential debate on September 12.\n\nIn the meantime, tech companies promise to show us we haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\n\n\u201cWhat we are going to see from these tools over the next two to five years is incredibly profound,\u201d Dane said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fundamentally change the way people work and interact with technology.\u201d\n\nBradesco's head of equity strategy Ben Laidler also thinks the election is a non-event for investors in the medium-term.

        "title": "Who finance pros say should replace Biden if the president steps aside",
        "content": "Stock market watchers quickly made their own lists of possible replacements for Joe Biden after the president delivered a debate performance last Thursday that amplified concerns about his fitness for a second term.\n\nThey range from the obvious \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 to less-obvious but more business-friendly choices such as Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThese names being floated by these finance pros share many similarities with lists being circulated by those in the political world.\n\nBut there are also some differences that are instructive about the current state of the Biden administration\u2019s relationship with corporate America \u2014 and which of Biden\u2019s allies have made inroads among C-suites.\n\nWhat those in the business world overall say they want is stability and a replacement that wouldn\u2019t unsettle markets this year as well as in 2025 and beyond.\n\nFor his part, Biden and his close allies have repeatedly and forcefully said in recent days that he has no intention of stepping aside. That has only minimally tamped down the speculation after his halting performance.\n\n\"There's not a clear replacement at hand,\" Clayton Allen, Eurasia Group director for the United States, said in a Yahoo Finance Live appearance on Friday, noting that any choice risks turning off \"big parts of the Democratic coalition.\" President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden step off Air Force One upon arrival at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey on June 29 for campaign fundraisers. (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) (MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images)\n\nThe 81-year-old president has delivered a series of more forceful speeches in the days since the debate that tamped down some of the concerns, as did supportive messages from figures like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.\n\nBiden is at Camp David until Monday evening for a pre-planned visit with family where, according to multiple reports, he is having discussions about the next steps for his campaign.\n\nOutreach to CEOs\n\nA name near the top of lists of both political and financial professionals is Harris. The vice president is clearly in a strong position as Washington\u2019s current number No. 2 with the support of many wings of the Democratic coalition.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, AGF Investments chief US policy strategist Greg Valliere called Harris \"not necessarily a shoo-in for the nomination\" given a list of weaknesses but called her nonetheless \"the early favorite to replace Biden\" if the president chooses to step aside.\n\nThe mentions for Harris are an indication of her strong position within the party but also, to some extent, her outreach to CEOs. Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at an event at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington with Kenyan President William Ruto and US Ambassador to Kenya Meg Whitman on May 24. (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) (BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images)\n\nIn March, Harris had lunch with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon as part of a regular series of meetings with business leaders she has been conducting.\n\nStory continues\n\nThen then Harris visited the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington in May, where she met with a series of business leaders including Mastercard (MA) CEO Michael Miebach and Microsoft (MSFT) Vice Chair and President Brad Smith.\n\nIn a deeper look at her CEO \"charm offensive\" published just a few days before the debate, Bloomberg described Harris as \"offering an olive branch\" to a community wary of Biden.\n\nAnother Biden-world figure garnering at least a few mentions is Raimondo, the secretary of the Commerce Department.\n\nThe former Rhode Island governor has outlined to Yahoo Finance in the past just how much time she spends on the phone taking the temperature of the business community. She says it's an essential part of her role as Commerce secretary.\n\nRaimondo has also garnered praise for her stewardship of key Biden economic programs, especially the implementation of the 2022 CHIPs and Science Act that is in the process of sending billions to revamp the semiconductor industry.\n\n\"A lot of businesses like her,\" noted Renaissance Macro\u2019s Steve Pavlick in a Yahoo Finance live appearance.\n\nHer name has also popped up on other lists, including New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof who described her as one of the figures who \"would be in a good position to defeat Trump.\"\n\nRaimondo was prominent on the list of candidates compiled by the Economist and even above other names more often mentioned in political circles, like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo speaks at an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Summit in England last November. (TOBY MELVILLE/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) (TOBY MELVILLE via Getty Images)\n\nWhat is perhaps being overlooked are the criticisms Raimondo would likely take among the Democratic base for being too friendly with business.\n\nAs just one example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has sent Secretary Raimondo a series of letters in recent months around issues like Big Tech and trade that have often raised concerns about whether Raimondo (who had a career in finance before entering politics) was too open to business concerns.\n\nThere is a name recognition issue.\n\nRaimondo may be well known in C-Suites but a recent poll from Blueprint 2024 found that 85% of Americans have no opinion of her one way or the other, making her one of Biden\u2019s cabinet members with the least national name identification.\n\nIn a note Monday, Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer highlighted that a key hurdle for Raimondo and Whitmer (as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttegieg) face is that \"they\u2019re all only modestly popular and untested on the national stage.\"\n\nOthers names\u2014and new pledges by Biden to stay in the race\n\nThe business world lists also include a range of figures top of mind to the political world as well.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is clearly in contention but observers note he is currently facing a contentious budget debate in California that could hamper his chances. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after speaking to reporters following the CNN presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in Atlanta. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) (Andrew Harnik via Getty Images)\n\nTwo other battleground state governors, Michigan's Whitmer as well as Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, are also often mentioned. As is Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and others.\n\nAll of this speculation is of course moot if Biden stays in the race as he has repeatedly pledged to do.\n\nHis political allies and family members \u2014 not to mention nearly every Democratic elected official as well as candidates being listed to replace him \u2014 have repeatedly this week tried to excuse last week's debate performance and blame other factors.\n\nAs for the president\u2019s discussion at Camp David this weekend, a New York Times report painted a picture of conversations with family members who are urging him to fight on.\n\nAnd as Harris herself put it during a CNN appearance immediately after the debate, Biden had a \"slow start\" but \"a strong finish.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Excellent Stocks That Can Beat the S&amp;P 500",
        "content": "We all want to beat the market. It's easier said than done, but doing your homework can give you an edge on the standard portfolio of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) these days. Here are three stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 that I think can do it again over time.\n\n1. Apple\n\nAn investment gem for years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was in the news a few weeks ago for becoming more valuable than Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). The company has outpaced the S&P 500 by 234% over the last five years.\n\nIt is one of Warren Buffett's favorites, and for good reason. Its products have lots of utility, and the phone and computer businesses have a significant barrier to entry. You need deep pockets and infrastructure to get involved in this game. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNaysayers to my Apple pick will likely point to last year's 2.8% decline in revenue and the weak first quarter of 2024. What I think is being missed here is the potential demand that Apple could create from the integration of AI-based programs into its products.\n\nMost recently, the chatter around Apple has been its announcement of Apple Intelligence, its planned AI business, and potential partnership with Meta Platforms on generative AI. This could be exactly what Apple needs to gain the momentum seen by stocks such as Nvidia, whose semiconductor chips are essential to AI-based businesses.\n\nI like Apple as a play on this burgeoning business, since it stands to be a new source of demand for the tech company. It has the product lineup necessary to implement AI in a way that will appeal to its large consumer base. As I said before, Apple's devices offer a lot of utility. Integrating AI into them only stands to increase that advantage.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) is a blue chip gem. The discount king creates consistent annual growth and earnings for shareholders, and its low-price strategy positions it well in our inflationary economy, where consumers are looking for the best deals.\n\nCharlie Munger, Warren Buffett's late partner, loved Costco, and it's easy to see why. It has outpaced the S&P 500 by 134% over the last five years, using a strong member base that drives comparable store sales (comps). In the first 16 weeks of the company's fiscal year, total comps increased by 4.7%, with a 12.6% increase in e-commerce. May sales results showed comps gained 6.4%, with e-commerce sales gaining 15.3%.\n\nThose figures don't match Nvidia's, but the key here is consistency and profitability over time, and a business model that is beneficial to consumers at any time. Costco has averaged double-digit revenue growth over the last five years, just a part of years of revenue and net earnings increases, and there seems to be little sign that the story will change.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Cava\n\nWish you could go back and buy into Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) before it was Chipotle? Cava Group(NYSE: Cava) just might be your shot.\n\nThe latter restaurant chain operates very similarly to its Mexican counterpart but focuses on Mediterranean cuisine. I'd challenge you to find many competitors of scale in the Mediterranean space, and Cava might be a great long-term play.\n\nHaving gone public only last year, Cava shares have beaten the S&P 500 by roughly 100% in that time. The restaurant chain has seen significant growth as it pushes to create a similar story to Chipotle. First-quarter revenue increased 30.3% year over year to $256 million, while its total number of restaurants increased 22.8% year over year, to 323 locations.\n\nFor being such a young company, and a quintessential growth stock, Cava has found profitability particularly early, making $13.28 million last year. To be fair, that's not significant on a per-share basis, amounting to a mere $0.12 per diluted share, but compared to a loss of $1.30 the year prior, I like seeing a company focused on profitability early.\n\nFull-year guidance is looking for comps growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, with net new-store openings of 50 to 54. To be clear, this is an investment fully focused on growth. Earnings are not the primary thing that will drive the share price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

ServiceNow exceeded guidance in the\u00a0first quarter by reporting $2.6 billion in revenue. That\u2019s a 24% year-over-year increase. More than $2.5 billion of the company\u2019s Q1 revenue was recurring.\n\nServiceNow enables digital workflows and helps companies become more efficient.

While AWS reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased by 28.4% year-over-year to reach $9.57 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only highlight from\u00a0Alphabet\u2019s first quarter results. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year while net income surged by 57% year-over-year.\n\nNet income growth is a big highlight,\u00a0since it prompted the tech conglomerate to offer its first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet reported a 29.4% net profit margin to close out the quarter, and if\u00a0cost cutting\u00a0measures continue, the firm can\u00a0end up with\u00a0elevated gains in the future.\n\nAlphabet still trades at a reasonable 28 P/E ratio.\u00a0It\u2019s the\u00a0online advertising leader and also one of the leaders in\u00a0cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\u00a0Wall Street analysts believe\u00a0that Alphabet\u00a0shares can\u00a0gain an additional 9% from current levels.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers hardware and software products, but its software segment has been the main growth driver. Cloud services and license support\u00a0made up\u00a072% of the firm\u2019s revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\u00a0This segment increased by 9%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0while Oracle\u2019s other segments reported slight\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0declines.\n\nCloud computing is the defining element of Oracle\u2019s investment thesis.\u00a0Q4 cloud revenue \u2014 IaaS and SaaS \u2014 increased by 20% year-over-year to reach $5.3 billion. Overall\u00a0revenue only inched up by 3% year-over-year to reach $14.3 billion.\n\nArtificial intelligence tailwinds should help Oracle\u2019s cloud platform generate\u00a0a higher percentage of\u00a0total revenue. This development should result in growth acceleration since the lagging segments won\u2019t have as much of an impact.\n\nOracle shares are up by 36% year-to-date and have gained 138% over the past five years.

The stock is currently rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and has a projected 11% upside. Long-term momentum has played a role in bullishness. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech conglomerate offers exposure to many industries: artificial intelligence, advertising, gaming, business software, social media and others. However, none of those segments are as\u00a0important\u00a0as Microsoft Cloud.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud platform generated $35.1 billion in\u00a0Q3 FY24 revenue, which is a 23% improvement compared to the same quarter last year. Microsoft also reported 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the board and grew its net income by 20%\u00a0year-over-year.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot allows the company to expand into numerous industries and presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Copilot is slowly\u00a0being integrated\u00a0across Microsoft\u2019s software products like LinkedIn and other places.\n\nCopilot\u00a0also has a cybersecurity division that\u00a0should increase Microsoft\u2019s presence in that vertical.\u00a0Artificial intelligence and cloud computing both present long-term growth opportunities for Microsoft.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

        "content": "Microsoft Corp has closed its authorised bricks-and-mortar stores in mainland China, according to three local distributors, as the US technology giant restructures its retail operations in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nThe company on Monday told local media that it decided to \"integrate [all distribution] channels in mainland China\", although consumers can continue buying products and services through its website and certain retail partners. The company also runs online storefronts on Taobao and JD.com.\n\nThe operators of authorised bricks-and-mortar Microsoft Stores on the mainland earlier received a notice from the company that their contracts had been terminated and that their shops must shut down by June 30, according to the three local distributors who declined to be identified.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nWhile Apple operates its own bricks-and-mortar stores in China and maintains ties with local resellers across the country, Microsoft had relied solely on independent third-party retailers to set up a network of branded franchise shops on the mainland. It is not known how many such local partners are affected.\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\n\nMicrosoft's consumer sales in mainland China will now be solely conducted via the company's website and other online retail platforms. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Microsoft's consumer sales in mainland China will now be solely conducted via the company's website and other online retail platforms. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nA Beijing-based distributor of Microsoft products, Qian Feng, said the retail landscape on the mainland has changed, with authorised stores losing relevance.\n\n\"The Chinese market is too small for Microsoft,\" Qian said. \"If they keep all the stores, they will lose money.\"\n\nThe exit of bricks-and-mortar Microsoft Stores on the mainland reflects the strategic change in retail operations that the Redmond, Washington-based company had announced on June 26, 2020.\n\nThe software giant said at the time that it will only keep Microsoft Experience Centres in London, New York City, Sydney and at its Redmond campus. The closing of Microsoft Store physical locations resulted in a pre-tax charge, including asset write-offs and impairments, of about US$450 million that was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts China-based retail network was not affected at the time because the mainland Microsoft Stores operated under a franchise business model.\n\nMicrosoft vice-chairman and president Brad Smith speaks during a hearing in Washington, DC, on June 13, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Microsoft vice-chairman and president Brad Smith speaks during a hearing in Washington, DC, on June 13, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg>\n\nAt a US congressional hearing last month, Microsoft vice-chairman and president Brad Smith said that China only accounted for around 1.5 per cent of the company's global revenue.\n\nSmith also confirmed that Microsoft is offering to relocate overseas its 700 to 800 employees in China. The Post reported in May that some Microsoft employees on the mainland, including those from its Azure cloud computing unit, were offered the option to move overseas to the US, Australia and Ireland.\n\nSome distributors in China expect to maintain their status as third-party independent retailers for Microsoft based on the domestic operations they have built up over the years.\n\nAuthorised Lenovo Group distributor Steven Li, who had served as a manager for a Microsoft Store in Shenzhen, said he will continue to sell Microsoft laptops and tablets with after-sales services. He said the only difference is that he can no longer promote his business as an \"authorised retailer\" for Microsoft, and this could drive some customers away.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 weekly preview: Tech stocks could rise 15% in 2H24",
        "content": "U.S. stocks edged lower on Friday as traders reacted to new economic data signaling slowing inflation and better-than-expected consumer sentiment.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.41% to close at 5,460.48, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.71% to 17,732.60. Both indexes hit new intraday highs earlier in the session before retreating. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 45.20 points, or 0.12%, ending at 39,118.86.\n\nAll three major indexes advanced in June, marking their seventh positive month in eight. The Nasdaq led with a nearly 6% monthly gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow rose 3.5% and 1.1%, respectively. For the week, the Nasdaq added 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow edged down by less than 0.1%.\n\nMay inflation slowed to its lowest annual rate in over three years, according to the Commerce Department. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1% for the month and 2.6% year-over-year, matching Dow Jones estimates.\r\nThe core PCE is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure.\n\nThe headline PCE, including food and energy, remained flat month-over-month and increased 2.6% annually, also meeting expectations.\n\nWith the Q1 2024 earnings season wrapped up, the market\u2019s attention this week will mainly center on upcoming economic data releases, most notably the ISM manufacturing index on Monday, the JOLTS job openings report on Tuesday, and the nonfarm payrolls (NFP) report on Friday. Moreover, the minutes from the June FOMC meeting will be published on Wednesday.\n\nFor Friday\u2019s employment report, Goldman Sachs economists expect that non-farm payrolls rose by 140,000 in June.\n\n\u201cBig Data measures continue to indicate a below-normal pace of job creation during the spring hiring season, and our layoff tracker is also edging higher from low levels,\u201d they said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe also assume a 50k drag from payback effects, because the longer-than-usual May payroll month likely pulled forward reported job growth into last month\u2019s report.\u201d\n\nEconomists also project that the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4%, reflecting rising household employment offsetting a 0.1 percentage point rebound in labor force participation to 62.6%.\n\nIn addition, there are several speaking engagements from Federal Reserve officials scheduled for this week, including Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday and New York Fed President Williams on Wednesday and Friday.\n\nBofA: S&P 500 poised for a strong second half after positive 1H\n\nBank of America strategists forecast a strong second half for the S&P 500 (SPX) following a positive first half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe benchmark equity index rose 14.48% in the first half, marking the 16th-best first-half performance since 1928. Historically, when the index rallies in the first six months, it tends to perform well in the latter half, being up 74% of the time with average and median returns of 5.70% and 6.56%, respectively.\n\nThe first half of 2024 marks the 26th time the SPX has gained between 10% and 20% in the initial six months. This pattern suggests a positive outlook, with the index historically rising 88% of the time in the second half, averaging a return of 8.58% and a median return of 10.13%.\n\nIn Presidential election years, a strong first half further boosts the SPX's prospects for the latter half, with an 88% chance of gains, BofA highlighted. However, the expected average and median returns are slightly lower at 6.98% and 5.47%, respectively.\n\nOverall, during the last six months of all Presidential election years since 1928, the SPX has risen 83% of the time, with average returns of 7.26% and median returns of 6.12%.\n\n\"When the SPX rallies over the first six months of the year, the index is stronger over the rest of the year and is up 74% of the time on average,\" BofA strategists said in a note.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBTIG: \u201cAs we enter the second half of the year, we are left with more questions than answers. Namely the breadth expansion that was occurring in late '23 fizzled out and was never able to find its footing despite cooling inflation and lower long-term rates. The equal-weight S&P 500 (SPW) has underperformed the SPX by nearly 10% over the first six months, one of the worst such stretches on record back to 1990 and by far the worst 'first six months' of the year. If small-caps are going to work, we think they have to start soon or they become the 'canary in the coalmine' rather than a rotation opportunity. At this point small-cap growth (IWO) looks better than value, but it's still in a 'show me' state.\u201d\n\nWedbush: \u201cWe believe NASDAQ has another strong 2H ahead as tech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand. On the enterprise AI front Nvidia/Microsoft will drive this while Apple/Meta/Google now unleash the consumer AI Revolution heading into year-end with iPhone 16 the beginning of this AI driven smartphone era. The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been the stars of the AI Party on the disco dance floor along with Nadella and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the enterprise AI tidal wave of spending has just begun with the Street now laser focused on who the winners are in this next wave of AI driven spend. Looking into 2H24 we believe a massive broader tech rally is ahead as the AI Revolution now accelerates.\n\nGoldman Sachs: \u201cThe first presidential debate shifted prediction market probabilities in favor of an Trump victory. The debate window generally saw modest upward moves in US equities and bond yields and mixed performance across FX. Shifts in asset prices were small relative to the shifts in election outcome probabilities.\n\n\u201cEquity and bond shifts were comparable to our fundamental estimates, but we ultimately expect clearer and broader USD strength from a shift towards a Republican presidency than what we saw in FX markets.\u201d\n\nDeutsche Bank: \u201cAs we noted last week, we see conditions in place for an equity market breather in the near term with diminished support from all three elements of our demand-supply framework: there is little room for positioning to rise after a sharp but narrow jump to elevated levels; inflows are likely to ease as risk appetite declines from stretched levels; and buybacks diminish temporarily as blackout periods ramp up. This suggests a sideways market in the near term, but one that is vulnerable to negative shocks with plenty of potential catalysts geopolitically as well as in domestic politics.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFOXA, GLBE, and SNOW added to Goldman's Americas Conviction list; 2 stocks removed\n\nSpirit Aero to be broken up as Boeing agrees $4.7 billion stock deal\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com \u2014 Despite the continued outperformance in the tech space, the market saw a broadening of the rally into more areas of the market over the last few weeks. In fact, the advance-decline ratio (also known as the market breadth indicator), which measures the number of positive stocks against the number of negative ones, hit a 15-month high just last week.\n\nBut were you able to bank on that trend, or are you still buying the same stocks that already rallied in the first half of the year?\n\nThose following our state-of-the-art AI-powered stock strategies for less than $7 a month as part of our exclusive summer sale are in that first bucket.\n\nJust to give you an example: While NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) - part of both Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies for June - kept on gaining, it was far from the top performer in our list, which had stocks such as Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) (+25% in June) and Autodesk Inc (NASDAQ:ADSK) (+22.75% in June) posting much better numbers.\n\nNot only that, more than a handful of stocks from our list outperformed Nvidia in June, showcasing our AI's impressive ability to pick winners otherwise obscure for most retail investors.\n\nThis has helped both our AI's Tech Titans and Beat the S&P 500 strategies beat the benchmark S&P 500 again in June. See below:\n\nTech Titans: +6.9% Beat the S&P 500: +3.7% S&P 500: +3.5%\n\nThese numbers have pushed Tech Titans year-to-date performance to an incredible +34.9%. That compares with a much-smaller 14.48% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nOur predictive AI didn't have to rely on stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for its top performance either. The real secret behind its top-level performance is that it finds stock picks before they get too expensive.\n\nNo late-momentum buying, no emotions. Only state-of-the-art AI-powered financial modeling.\n\nIn fact, to keep the freshness of its picks for the shifting H2 environment, our predictive AI has run one of the greatest updates in its history TODAY.\n\nDon't miss out on the July winners list!

        "content": "This article will list world's best company according to the media.\n\nTransforming the Media Landscape: Challenges, Growth, and the Influence of Major Corporations\n\nMany people ask what a media company is and why their opinions matter. Media companies produce and distribute content through traditional and digital channels, influencing public opinion and shaping narratives via their broad reach and credibility. Knowing that the media sector encompasses a wide array of activities including advertising, broadcasting, networking, and news, we cannot ignore their impact on the market. Such firms operate across diverse fields, catering to end customers ranging from individuals to large enterprises. This list highlights major media corporations, providing insights into their operations and offerings.\n\nWhile digital media is faring considerably well, the same cannot be said about traditional media. In fact, the year 2022 saw losses from traditional media companies amounting to $5 billion on streaming services-except for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Paramount, are all some big entertainment conglomerates that are a part of the traditional media downfall in one way or another. Factors such as a weak advertising market, rising production costs, and declining revenues in traditional media have all been responsible for their demise.\n\nAn Accenture survey of 6,000 consumers highlights additional challenges by revealing their media consumption behaviors. The survey reveals 55.9% of those surveyed expressing frustration over paying at multiple platforms to access content, 65.5% finding it inconvenient to enter personal information repeatedly, and more than half complaining that recommendations provided did not match their interests. Moreover, as many as 30% of consumers now spend over 10 minutes searching for new content, a\u00a0 figure that has since doubled from the past. As a result of many of these problems, linear TV viewership has dropped by 26% since last year, while Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) has surged by 57%. Additionally, consumers have significantly increased their usage of social media (52%), social video (52%), and video games (50%)\u2014areas where traditional media companies have minimal presence.\n\nThe media industry has experienced a profound transformation with the successful expansion of the subscription model, presenting new growth opportunities amid substantial declines in advertising revenues. Leading this shift, Amazon and Netflix have both achieved remarkable increases in revenue and audience numbers. Moreover, companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing in diversified revenue streams such as gaming, streaming, and even live sports. These revenue streams give them a \u201csafety net\u201d, something that pure play companies lack.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, media firms have considerable influence over buyers, and their earnings place them at the top of the list.\u00a0 The companies on the Forbes 2023 list of the top 100 companies collectively represent 61 different countries, $51.7 trillion in sales, $4.5 trillion in income, $238 trillion in assets, and $88 trillion in market value. As such, the ranking of the world's largest publicly traded firms currently leans heavily towards the United States, marking a shift since the 2008 financial crisis. Bagging the top spot in Forbes top companies is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a market capitalization of $580 billion as of June 2024. This American multinational finance company is one of the most valuable companies in the world. The number two spot is taken by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) , an American multinational conglomerate holding company. Companies such as chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also gaining considerable traction owing to AI, having moved up more than a 100 spots on Forbes\u2019 list. However, when talking about the best companies according to the media, the results may not tally with Forbes lists. world's best company according to the media\n\nImage by Igor Karimov from Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nThe compilation of the best firms by media began with lists published by media companies. In this regard, Forbes conducted extensive research, compiling multiple major rankings of the most valuable corporations, largest companies, top employers, and leading technology firms. Their methodology ranks the world's largest firms based on four metrics: sales, profitability, assets, and market value. To identify the top employers, they surveyed over 170,000 employees from international corporations and organizations across more than 50 countries. We also referred to Fast Company's list of the most innovative companies, top 100 tech companies, and Visual Capitalist's list of the most valuable brands. We compared these lists with previous years' rankings to determine which firms consistently appeared. It's important to note that these lists encompass both media companies and companies associated with media brands, too. This is how our compilation of the world's 30 best companies according to the media, as recognized by the media, was formulated.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nBased on our study, this is the world's best company according to the media.\n\n1. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6\n\nLiving under a rock would be the only way to remain unaware of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its profound influence across various sectors and industries. Originally established as a software company, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) has evolved into a tech powerhouse, offering a diverse array of products and services including operating systems, cloud services, game consoles, and AI technologies. Since its inception in 1975, Microsoft has made an indelible impact on the global stage, culminating in record-breaking revenue exceeding $62 billion USD in the second financial quarter of 2024. As of 2024, Microsoft's market capitalization stands impressively at $3.12 trillion USD, which is why is Microsoft on the top of the list of world's 30 best companies according to the media.\n\nCheck out our complete list of World\u2019s 30 Best Companies According to the Media.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most hated brands to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields.

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock is now in treacherous waters: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.\n\nIn life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.\n\nSure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.\n\nTrust me, it's not \u2014 and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.\n\nThis same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nI know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.\n\nOver the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.\n\nFor perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.\n\nSome folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my \"Opening Bid\" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.\n\nAll of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.\n\nBut if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.\n\nNvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.  Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. \"In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,\" Krinsky said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nSimilar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to \"in-line\" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.\n\nAnd I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.\n\n\"When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that\u2019s a bad sign \u2014 a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\nOthers don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!\n\n\"But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,\" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.\n\nSpeaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Many investors flocked toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past years to capitalize on the growth of generative AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT. That bullish stampede drove many tech stocks higher -- even as inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds battered other less-resilient sectors.\n\nBut as the first half of 2024 ends, some investors might be wondering if the historic AI rally will run out of steam. I think investors should be a bit more selective with their AI stocks, but three of the most obvious plays -- Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- are still worth buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the largest producer of discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world. It once generated most of its revenue from the PC gaming market, but its data center GPU sales skyrocketed over the past two years to become its largest business segment.\n\nThe growth was entirely driven by the rapid expansion of the AI market since Nvidia's high-end GPUs are widely used to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. All of the world's top generative AI companies -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google -- currently use its GPUs.\n\nNvidia now controls 88% of the discrete GPU market, according to JPR, and the market's demand for its chips continues to outstrip its supply. As a result, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 98% and 109%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next January). Its stock still looks reasonably valued at less than 50 times forward earnings and could head even higher as the AI market expands.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer, also known as Supermicro, carved out its own niche by producing high-performance, liquid-cooled servers for demanding tasks. That's why it wasn't too surprising when Nvidia partnered with the company a few years ago and granted it access to its high-end data center GPUs before many of its larger competitors.\n\nNvidia's support enabled Supermicro to claim a 10% share of the dedicated AI server market. Bank of America expects it to grow its slice to 17% over the next three years as the broader market expands 150%.\n\nSupermicro already generates about half of its revenue from AI servers, but that percentage should keep rising as it gains ground against bigger server makers and diversifies its business with new AI servers powered by Advanced Micro Devices' cheaper chips.\n\nFor 2024, analysts expect Supermicro's revenue and earnings to grow 110% and 102%, respectively. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at just 23 times forward earnings, so it could still have plenty of room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft became a growth stock again over the past decade as it expanded its cloud-based services and Azure -- which became the world's second-largest cloud infrastructure platform after Amazon Web Services (AWS). It also became the largest investor in OpenAI and subsequently integrated the start-up's generative AI tools into Azure, its Bing search engine, and its other cloud-based services.\n\nThe expansion of that AI ecosystem boosted Azure's growth and widened its moat against Google in the search and advertising markets. It also acquired Activision Blizzard last year to strengthen its Xbox gaming business and lock more gamers into its subscription-based Game Pass and Cloud Gaming ecosystems.\n\nMicrosoft's broader diversification makes it a balanced way to profit from the growth of the cloud, AI, and gaming markets. Analysts expect the company's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 14% and 13%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 (which ends next June). Its stock might not seem cheap at 34 times forward earnings, but its strengths should justify its higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Better Semiconductor Stock: Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices",
        "content": "In the battle for chip supremacy, two of the top companies battling it out are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD). Over the past five years, both stocks have been strong performers. AMD is up over 433% during that stretch, which is outstanding. However, that return pales in comparison to the over 3,000% gain in Nvidia's stock.\n\nNvidia has been the better stock during the past five years, but which stock will likely outperform over the next five?\n\nNvidia vs. AMD\n\nAt the moment, the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure benefits both companies, given the demand for the graphic processing units (GPUs) needed to power large language model (LLM) training and artificial intelligence (AI) inference. This insatiable demand for GPUs led Nvidia's data center segment to post $22.6 billion in fiscal 2025 Q1 revenue (for the quarter ending April 28, 2024), an incredible 427% year-over-year increase. AMD's data center segment, meanwhile, saw its fiscal 2024 first-quarter revenue soar more than 80% year over year to $2.3 billion.\n\nNvidia has become the clear leader in the AI chip space, which can be seen with its data center segment generating nearly 10 times the amount of revenue that AMD's data center segment produced. The company's GPUs have become the primary ones used, due to its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, which developers have long been trained on to program the chips. This, in turn, has helped create a wide moat for the company's GPUs, giving it more than about 80% market share.\n\nHowever, the segment is still growing nicely for AMD as its GPUs become an alternative to Nvidia's chips, which are in tight supply. Enterprises often like to have multiple suppliers so they don't become dependent on just one.\n\nAMD is making some inroads. Last month, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) announced that it would offer clusters of AMD's MI300X chips through its Azure cloud computing service as a Nvidia alternative. In addition, AMD recently said it has had serious inquiries about building an AI cluster with over 1 million GPUs. Given that AI training clusters are typically built with a few thousand GPUs, this would be a huge win for AMD if it ever came to fruition.\n\nWhile Nvidia's results are dominated by its GPU products and data center segment, the data center only accounted for 43% of AMD's total revenue, while it was 87% of Nvidia's revenue. At the same time, some of AMD's other segments struggled, which led to total year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter of only 2%, compared to 262% for Nvidia.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhich stock is the better buy?\n\nDespite Nvidia's strong stock performance, the two stocks actually trade at nearly identical forward price-to-earnings (P/E) valuations. Nvidia trades at a forward P/E of 45.6, compared to AMD at 44.8. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWith the valuations so similar, the question of which is the better stock to own going forward should come down to which company will perform better operationally over the next few years.\n\nWorking in AMD's favor is that its data center segment has a much smaller base, compared to Nvidia. As the smaller company, it has the opportunity to take market share away from Nvidia. If the company can become a viable second source of GPU chips, it should see a lot of continued growth in the segment.\n\nMeanwhile, looking five years out, the company's gaming segment, which has been a big drag, should see a huge improvement starting in 2027 or 2028. Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch its next-generation gaming console in 2028, while Sony is expected to launch its PlayStation 6 console in 2027 or 2028.\n\nBack in 2022, AMD revenue related to the Sony PlayStation 5 (PS5) was nearly $3.8 billion, representing 16% of its revenue. Console sales typically peak their third year after launch, and the PS5 was introduced in 2020.\n\nWorking in Nvidia's favor is the moat it has created with its CUDA platform. Developers have already learned on its platform, and it takes time and training to work with other GPUs, which costs money. This should allow the company to keep its lead.\n\nMeanwhile, AMD has started rapidly pushing innovation by developing next-generation architecture GPU platforms that will be backward compatible with its existing architecture. This should help drive huge demand from customers looking to stay at the cutting edge of AI capabilities.\n\nIf AI is still in its early innings and the data center buildout is just beginning, then Nvidia is my preferred stock to buy between the two chipmakers, given the moat it has created. However, I think AMD could also be a very solid investment, especially ahead of a gaming console refresh cycle in the next few years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the state with the most national historic landmarks in the US. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 20 States with the Most National Historic Landmarks in the US.\n\nDifferent buildings, museums, parks, districts, and monuments play an important role in preserving culture and tradition in any country. In 1938, America took its first step in this effort by preserving the Salem Maritime historic site. The historic site covers nine acres along the Salem waterfront and includes twelve historic buildings and a downtown visitor center.\n\nThe USA is home to over 2,600 national historic landmarks, with almost 25% located in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York. Three cities, namely Philadelphia, Boston, and New York City each have more national historic landmarks than 40 of the 50 states individually.\n\nInitially, the Interior Secretary was responsible for managing properties of national historical significance. In 1960, this authority was transferred to the National Register of Historic Places and officially formalized.\n\nThe importance of preserving historic sites and landmarks has grown over time, with 100 ships and shipwrecks from various states now designated as national historic landmarks. The National Park Service also recommends maintaining and promoting these historic landmarks for the future as they help boost the economy, promote tourism, and maintain cultural traditions.\n\nSince 2022, the National Park Service has allocated significant funding to expand its collection of landmarks, aiming to cover a broader range of American narratives. Currently, only a small portion of national historic sites reflect histories that hold significance for communities, such as Black Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos. As of 2022, only about 40 landmarks directly relate to the histories of women, Black Americans, and Asian Americans. This highlights the ongoing need for further efforts and improvements in this area.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is collaborating with various organizations on technological innovations for historical preservation. The company is working with heritage activists to digitally document cultures across the world. Microsoft AI uses advanced algorithms and computing power to quickly create detailed 3D models from thousands of photos.\n\nHere\u2019s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nStory continues The State with the Most National Historic Landmarks in the US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 states with the most national historic landmarks in the US, we referred to the database of the National Park Service.

Factors like geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and tightened monetary conditions have been slowing down the recovery process. One of the biggest problems that the world is battling with currently is inflation. However, a few recent developments hint towards a brighter future with headline inflation levels declining to prepandemic levels in some economies. By the end of 2023, global inflation fell to around 2.3% which was a significant decrease from the peak of 9.5% witnessed in the second quarter of 2022. But this progress is limited to a few developed economies like the U.S., China, and Germany. These are the most powerful countries in the world by economy, with GDP levels of $28.8 trillion, $18.5 trillion, and $4.6 trillion, respectively, as of 2024 - we have discussed them in detail in 20 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy.\n\nOne of the countries that have led this post pandemic recovery is the United States. The country has been capable of preserving its status as the leading global economy. According to the IMF, the GDP of the US was $26.95 trillion in 2023. The value for real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The United States is expected to continue climbing at this trajectory as the country is projected to have a real GDP of $32 trillion by the year 2040. For developing countries, however, it is a completely different story. These economies have been recovering but the recovery is quite slow, with inflation in the last quarter of 2023 standing at 9.9%. You can refer to 25 Countries with Developing Economies but Slow Growth Rates, to read about some of these economies in depth. Saudi Arabia and Poland are two of such economies with slowest growth rates amongst the developing economies with GDP levels of $1.07 trillion and $842.2 billion, as of 2023.\n\nWhile these macroeconomic trends provide us with a broader picture of the economy, the role of major corporations and industry giants in the rebuilding of the economy cannot be overlooked. Among other factors, businesses across major economic regions are driving the growth globally. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the most valuable companies in the US. With a market capitalization of $3.311 trillion, as of 13th June 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest player in the technology sector. As of 2024, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) installed base of active devices has exceeded 2.2 billion globally. Apple reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 on February 1, 2024. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion while earnings per share of $2.18 beat the consensus estimates by $0.08 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global technology firm with a market capitalization of $3.283 trillion, as of 13th June 2024. According to the quarterly financial reports released on January 30, 2024 for the second quarter of 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million.

From the values of the latest year, 2023 and the base year, 2022, percentage change in real GDP was calculated. The states were then arranged in descending order based on their GDP growth rates and the state with the highest percentage change in GDP was picked.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

North Dakota\n\nPercentage Change in GDP: 5.87%\n\nReal GDP 2023: $58,015 million\n\nReal GDP 2022: $54,799 million\n\nWith a percentage change in GDP of 5.87% over the period 2022-23, North Dakota is the U.S. state with the fastest-growing economy.\n\nNorth Dakota has been enjoying a robust economy, characterized by a flourishing energy development sector, in addition to strong agriculture, real estate, and government sectors. North Dakota experienced the highest growth in real GDP among all 50 states in the first quarter of 2023, surging by 12.4%, according to North Dakota Governor\u2019s Office. In 2023, the real gross domestic product (GDP) of North Dakota was 58.02 billion U.S. dollars.\n\nYou can see the full free list by going to the 20 U.S. States with the Fastest-Growing Economies.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Brad Gerstner is Bullish on This Tech Stock Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks.\n\nGerstner is Bullish on Tech in 2024\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\n\nGerstner Thinks Now is the Right Time to \u00a0Invest in Tech\n\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and\u00a0addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\n\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\n\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $694,133,306\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is among Brad Gerstner's top 5 stock picks. The stock accounts for nearly 11% of Altimeter Capital's 13F portfolio. The company's overall growth in the quarter was driven by the demand for Microsoft Cloud, which logged $35 billion in revenue, up by 23% year-over-year. Microsoft Azure remained a top pick among customers. Over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies and more than 30,000 organizations use Azure OpenAI Service and more than 30,000 organizations use Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for their organization's needs. The number of organizations using Copilot grew by 175% quarter-over-quarter.\n\nMicrosoft introduced Phi-3 in April, the company's family of small language models measuring 3.8 billion parameters, that perform better than large models. It is available in the Microsoft Azure AI Model Catalog and on Hugging Face. Phi-3 models will also be available as an NVIDIA NIM Microservice that is capable of being deployed anywhere. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to launch additional models to the Phi-3 like Phi-3-small, measuring 7 billion parameters, and Phi-3-medium, measuring 14 billion parameters.\n\nAzure Arc, a hybrid multi-cloud management tool, now has over 33,000 customers, increasing twofold year-over-year. The company saw an 80% increase for its $100 million Azure deals year-over-year. $10 million deals, on the other hand, doubled in the same time frame. Its next-gen analytics platform, Fabric, has over 11,000 paid customers.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2024, 293 hedge funds held stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with total positions amounting to $88.16 billion. Mar Vista Investment Partners is also bullish on the stock because of its strong position in the digital landscape. Here are comments from Mar Vista Investment Partners\u2019 Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes. Microsoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 5th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. You can visit 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner to see the other tech stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Microsoft is US$415 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$447 suggests Microsoft is potentially trading close to its fair value Our fair value estimate is 15% lower than Microsoft's analyst price target of US$490\n\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Microsoft\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$68.7b US$77.7b US$92.7b US$109.0b US$131.4b US$148.0b US$162.3b US$174.3b US$184.6b US$193.6b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x25 Analyst x26 Analyst x15 Analyst x6 Analyst x5 Est @ 12.70% Est @ 9.60% Est @ 7.44% Est @ 5.92% Est @ 4.86% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%  US$64.2k US$67.9k US$75.7k US$83.2k US$93.8k US$98.8k US$101.2k US$101.7k US$100.7k US$98.7k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$886b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$194b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.3t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.3t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$2.2t\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.1t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$447, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.998. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Microsoft\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Reduced liquidity, greater volatility, and more sensitivity to bad news and market moves also make trading lesser-known tech stocks riskier than buying blue-chip counterparts.\n\nOf course, at the same time, that\u2019s what makes buying these tech stocks all the more rewarding. Here are a few to consider:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPhotronics (PLAB) PLAB stock: Electronic board, pen, processor on the background of schematic circuit diagram and photomask for manufacture of printed circuit boards.\n\nSource: Mentor57 / Shutterstock\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is a key player in today\u2019s cutting-edge technology landscape with immense potential for future growth. Unlike other semiconductor stocks, Photronics specializes in the development of semiconductor photomasks. This technology is intricate but has profound implications for the future.\n\nFirstly, Photronics\u2019 photomasks are crucial for ensuring the precision and accuracy required in microchip manufacturing. These photomasks facilitate the advancement of artificial intelligence and quantum computing by enabling the creation of increasingly complex circuitry with greater precision. Additionally, they play a pivotal role in shrinking transistors and components, essentially driving Moore\u2019s Law forward. This combination of precision and cost-effectiveness positions Photronics at the nexus of current and emerging technologies, making Photronics a strong candidate among lesser-known tech stocks.\n\nTrading at just 12x earnings, Photronics is attractively priced for a tech stock. Its income is steady, if not spectacular, indicating solid financial health. Although relatively young in the semiconductor industry, Photronics stands to benefit significantly from the growing reliance on semiconductors across various sectors.\n\nYext (YEXT) A Yext (YEXT) banner hangs on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou\u2019ve probably encountered Yext (NYSE:YEXT) or its diverse marketing products, perhaps without realizing it. With extensive market penetration, Yext\u2019s platform is utilized by corporate giants like Samsung and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). However, its potential as a standout among tech stocks goes mostly unnoticed.\n\nYext provides an all-encompassing suite of digital marketing tools, including SEO, content management, reputation and review management, social media, and deep analytics to drive strategic decisions. As internet marketing grows increasingly complex, developing in-house expertise for all these demands becomes prohibitively expensive. Yext\u2019s platform aggregates these essential services, offering a vital solution for navigating the digital marketing landscape. Moreover, Yext\u2019s platform has inherent \u201cstickiness\u201d that fosters client loyalty, as the costs of switching to another system are high once integrated into Yext\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings report was strong, highlighting significant AI integrations. While AI is now widespread, it remains underutilized in digital marketing, a gap Yext is effectively bridging. Yext\u2019s recent per-share performance of $0.05 contrasts sharply with the previous year\u2019s loss of $0.03. Despite this positive outlook and earnings beat, shares have declined this year, presenting an excellent entry point for investors. Yext offers a promising opportunity to invest in the future of AI-driven digital marketing and to gain a stake in lesser-known tech stocks.\n\nStem\u00a0(STEM) An image of a man charging an electric car with icons for renewable energy sources in the background; renewable energy grid\n\nSource: petovarga/Shutterstock\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) stands out in the sustainable energy sector by merging renewable energy solutions with artificial intelligence. At the core of Stem\u2019s offerings is Athena, a sophisticated control system that integrates and optimizes resources from generators, grid power, solar farms, and battery storage. Athena uses AI to make real-time decisions based on factors like weather and energy pricing, delivering a self-managing, efficient energy solution for large-scale enterprise clients.\n\nDespite its current penny stock status, Stem has ambitious growth plans, with leadership aiming for a tenfold increase in value. The company\u2019s strategic vision, outlined in its \u201cAI and the Future of Energy\u201d white paper, details how AI integration will drive efficiency and growth in sustainable energy markets.\n\nLike many speculative tech stocks, Stem faces challenges such as a lack of profitability and cyclical sales that introduce variability. However, the company has progressed beyond its pre-revenue phase and has a growing portfolio of completed projects. Stem represents a promising long-term investment opportunity in the sustainable energy sector, particularly for those looking to capitalize on the emerging influence of AI within green infrastructure. Adding Stem to your portfolio could be a strategic move to benefit from the ongoing integration of AI in renewable energy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment and in this article, we will talk about TheTop MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment.\n\nDeclining College Enrollments\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that college enrollment decreased by nearly 14.6% in the US between 2010 and 2021. Particularly, enrollments at 4-year private for-profit colleges decreased by about 54%. Declining enrollments in colleges is an indication that many high school graduates are either struggling to cope with the financial difficulties that come with a conventional career path or simply failing to see the value of investing in a college degree. According to a survey published by HCM Strategists, 64% of survey respondents who did not wish to attend college did so because of financial reasons. 38% were not willing to attend college due to fears about the cost of college and amassing debt. The remaining 26% believed it was more important to work and earn money in the short term.\n\nIn times past, it was quite common for American students to utilize educational loans in order to secure their future. However, BankRate reveals that 24% of Americans believe that borrowing too much for their education is their biggest financial regret. Consequently, even those capable of obtaining student loans are skeptical about whether or not a college degree is worth the debt. Moreover, increasing interest rates on federal student loans are likely to shake confidence in student loans even further. Recently, the Education Department announced that as of July 1st, the interest rate on new federal student loans would be rising to 6.53%, in comparison to 5.5% currently. In addition, rates on graduate and professional loans will be rising to 8.08%.\n\nDue to the increasing impracticality of college education, many individuals are choosing to supplement their CVs with comparatively affordable and flexible alternatives. One such alternative that has become quite popular is digital education platforms such as Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY) and Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR). While such courses are unable to unlock doors in the same manner as a college degree, they can be used to learn useful skills. Moreover, several renowned companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) now offer professional certifications online through Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), allowing users to showcase their skills proficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nMBA Enrollment Trends\n\nDeclining enrollments in colleges isn\u2019t exclusively an American phenomenon. Whilst some countries around the world are currently experiencing an increase in college enrollments, research from GMAC reveals that business school applications are experiencing a decline worldwide. In a survey of nearly 250 business schools, it was revealed that applications to all business school programs fell by almost 5 % in 2023, following a 3.4 % decline in 2022.\n\nThe statistics are even worse for MBA program applications, which fell by 6.5% and 4.9% during 2022 and 2023 respectively. MBA is arguably the most prestigious graduate accreditation offered by business schools. Apart from allowing individuals of non-business backgrounds to pivot their careers towards a management path, an MBA can be a catalyst for career growth. In fact, in 2022, GMAC estimated that MBA graduates working at US companies earn a median annual salary of $115,000. In comparison, those with a bachelor's degree earned a median salary of $75,000.\n\nConsidering this, it might be surprising why fewer and fewer people are inclined to enroll in an MBA, even in comparison to other business school degrees. However, much like college education in general, the financial requisites of an MBA, as well as the risks associated with student debt, have resulted in a decline in MBA enrollment. While the cost of an MBA depends greatly on the institution of study, Education Data Initiative estimates that an average MBA in the US costs $56,850. For top-tier B-schools, this figure is well over $200,000. In addition, most MBA students also have to deal with the financial impact of having to relocate and/or give up work for the course of their degree.\n\nThus, despite the many benefits of an MBA, it has become an unfeasible career path for many working-class Americans. However, much like alternatives that are offered by Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), many high-ranked universities now offer online MBA degrees that are both affordable and flexible to the needs of working-class Americans. In addition, most of these degrees can be completed without forgoing your existing job.\n\nOnline MBA: An Alternative to Conventional MBA\n\nAn online MBA degree from the Jack Welch Management Institute at Strayer University has an estimated cost of $35,000, just 62% of an average MBA. It is worth noting that this particular degree was featured in the list of Top 10 Online MBA Programs by both The Princeton Review and Poets & Quants. Strayer University is a subsidiary of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA), Inc., a company dedicated to providing innovative educational services.\n\nIn late April, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) announced its Q1 2024 financial results. During the period, the company achieved a YoY increase in revenue of 13.1% to $290.3 million. The majority of revenue was generated through the company\u2019s U.S. Higher Education (USHE) Segment, which comprises of Strayer University and Capella University. The segment yields a revenue of $219.2 million, which was an 11.3% increase from the same period in 2023.\n\nImproved margins in the USHE segment yielded an overall adjusted net income of $26.8 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.11. In Q1 2023, the company posted an adjusted diluted LPS of $0.09, primarily caused by significant losses in its Australia/New Zealand segment, which has since turned profitable. Currently, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock has a forward P/E ratio of 23.15 and is priced at approximately $109.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock and its potential to generate returns, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAlthough online MBA is an affordable alternative to in-person MBA programs, the quality of in-person learning is difficult to emulate in an online environment. Thus, individuals looking to enroll in the best MBA programs might find that the highest-paying MBA programs are ones that offer in-person, full-time instruction. One method of figuring out what are the most profitable MBA degrees is to calculate whichMBA school has the best ROI. With that in mind, join us as we look at the top MBA programs with the highest return on investment. The Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nThe Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment, we initially picked out the most highly rated MBA programs in the US. We used rankings from sources such as QS and Fortune to develop a shortlist of 50 universities. To ensure the schools were comparable, we focused only on full-time, two-year MBA programs, which is the most common structure for MBA degrees. Further research was narrowed down to these only.\n\nAmong these highly rated MBA programs in the US, we calculated the average expense using the cost of attendance data provided by each school. To calculate each program\u2019s return we used the median base salary based on the latest available employment reports. Using an expected increase in salary of 3% per year, we calculated each program\u2019s return on investment during the first 5 years of employment. The top 15 institutes were chosen as the top MBA programs with the highest return on investment.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nHere is the top MBA program with the highest return on investment:\n\n1. The University of Texas at Austin - McCombs School of Business\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 10\n\nTotal Cost of Attendance: $177,610\n\nMedian Base Salary: $175,000\n\nROI: 423%\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. In 2023, the school\u2019s MBA graduates achieved the highest average base salary in its history of $157,735 and a median salary of $175,000. The estimated 2-year cost of attendance of the program is $177,610, the second lowest on our list.\n\nAccording to the institution\u2019s website, McCombs facilitated 80% of job opportunities through internships, recruiting through Texas McCombs corporate partner ecosystem, alumni and staff networking, or other UT Austin resources. Approximately 69% of MBA graduates secured employment in Southwest US, while 43% of all graduates ended up in the consulting industry.\n\nTo learn about other top MBA programs with the highest return on investment, you can check out our detailed report on the 15 Top MBA Programs with the Highest Return on Investment.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best online ESL courses to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has told more than a dozen state agencies and public universities in Texas that Russian state-sponsored hackers accessed emails between them and the software giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGavin Newsom Is Ready for the Biden Emergency Biden\u2019s Disastrous Debate Accelerates Doubts Over Candidacy The Question on Democrats\u2019 Minds: How to Replace Biden? Supreme Court Overturns Chevron Rule in Blow to Agency Power \u2018I Was Afraid of This\u2019: Biden Debate Debacle Rocks US Allies\n\nThe attackers were able to gain access to the communications through a breach of Microsoft, disclosed in January, in which they stole emails from some of the company\u2019s executives. The agencies that Microsoft warned of exposure in the attack include the Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Workforce Commission, Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, Texas General Land Office and the Texas State Securities Board, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\n\nMicrosoft has blamed a hacking group it calls Midnight Blizzard, which is tied to Russian intelligence services, for the attack.\n\nThe state and Microsoft are still examining the effect of the breach. An official with the Texas cybersecurity agency, Steve Pier, acknowledged on Friday the exposure of state emails, but said that so far they appear to be only routine administrative communications.\n\nNews of the Texas agencies being impacted by the Microsoft hack offers a fuller view of the range of the compromise, and it raises concerns about a US adversary potentially accessing sensitive information about employees, financial matters or critical infrastructure in one of the country\u2019s most populous and economically important states.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, the state of Texas was not breached. Microsoft was breached, which has involved some state of Texas emails,\u201d Pier, of the Texas Department of Information Resources, said in a statement. He said his agency first heard about the exposures from Microsoft this week and is still assessing the number of affected entities.\n\nMicrosoft declined to say which customers were receiving notices about the attack. \u201cWe will continue to coordinate, support and assist our customers in taking mitigating measures,\u201d a company spokesperson said Friday.\n\nMicrosoft told the General Land Office on Monday that the hackers got hold of 11 of its emails to the technology giant, according to Kimberly Hubbard, a spokesperson for the Texas agency, who said the messages were mostly about technical support.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThere was nothing in those emails that contained sensitive or confidential information or information that a threat actor could leverage to attack us,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cWe have not seen any signs of system access or subsequent attacks to our network related to this Microsoft incident.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Workforce Commission, Sarah Fischer, said Microsoft told the agency on Wednesday that its \u201cemail systems were impacted\u201d but didn\u2019t say what the hackers may have accessed.\n\nRepresentatives of the Department of Transportation and Securities Board didn\u2019t respond Friday to requests for comment. A Department of Motor Vehicles spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIn January, Microsoft announced that hackers had stolen senior leaders\u2019 emails that they were using to try to break into customers\u2019 communications, including those of government agencies. The company this week told additional customers that their emails were accessed by the hackers, and began providing previously notified clients with details of what was taken.\n\nThe company pinned the breach on a group that US and UK authorities have said is part of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Midnight Blizzard is also referred to as APT 29 and Cozy Bear.\n\nIt remains unclear how many other Microsoft clients were exposed. In April, US federal agencies were ordered to analyze emails, reset compromised credentials and work to secure Microsoft cloud accounts amid concerns that the hackers may have accessed correspondence.\n\nThe fallout from the breach is coming into fuller view as the Redmond, Washington-based company is facing a series of high-profile and damaging security failures that have drawn strong condemnation from the US government.\n\nIn April, a government review board issued a scathing report that criticized Microsoft for having an \u201cinadequate\u201d security culture and cited Midnight Blizzard as evidence that the company hadn\u2019t yet fixed the problem. Microsoft is now in the middle of its biggest security overhaul in decades.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Larger companies are sometimes perceived as having less upside potential than smaller ones. That's one reason some people might hesitate to invest in stocks with market caps above $1 trillion.\n\nBut tech giants Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have a new secret weapon that could allow them to deliver solid returns in the medium term: artificial intelligence (AI). Even beyond that, Microsoft and Meta Platforms have numerous qualities of \"forever stocks.\"\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft was partly responsible for kick-starting Wall Street's recent obsession with AI, which began when ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Microsoft has been an investor in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nSince the initial craze that made the AI chatbot famous, the two companies have amended their collaboration, with Microsoft doubling down and boosting its stake in the privately held AI specialist to 49%. The partners also offer services that allow other companies to build their own generative AI platforms, which Microsoft offers through its cloud computing arm, Azure.\n\nAccording to Microsoft's management, more than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI services. Those services look particularly promising for the company, not least because cloud computing was already its most important growth driver. Management says that Azure continues to gain market share partly thanks to AI.\n\nThat is helping Microsoft deliver solid results. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, revenue increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, and net income rose 20% to $21.9 billion.\n\nIts recent results have been strong, but what makes Microsoft a forever stock? At least three things: First, it is an incredibly innovative company, an important factor for it to stay relevant and successful over the long run.\n\nSecond, the company has solid competitive advantages stemming from several sources. Its computer operating system benefits from high switching costs, and it has one of the most valuable brand names in the world.\n\nAnd third, it has attractive opportunities and a long runway for growth in several industries, especially in AI and cloud computing. Income seekers should also find what they want with this stock: Microsoft is arguably the most attractive dividend stock among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe company has increased its payouts by almost 168% in the past decade, and reinvested dividends can substantially boost investors' long-term returns. That's another excellent reason to hold on to the stock for good.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nLast year, Facebook parent Meta Platforms released Llama, a large language model that has become popular in its own right. It has since introduced several newer versions of Llama in an open-source capacity.\n\nLlama is the backbone of Meta AI, a virtual assistant the company recently debuted. Meta Platforms has also implemented various other related initiatives to boost its business. AI algorithms on Facebook and Instagram that help encourage users to watch Reels for extended stretches of time are helping bolster the company's advertising revenue.\n\nThat being said, AI doesn't contribute much to Meta's revenue and earnings yet, but that could change, considering the company is setting itself up to be a leader in the field.\n\nIn the meantime, it still has one of the largest digital ecosystems -- perhaps the largest -- of any company worldwide. It ended the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users. When ad spending dropped a couple of years ago, it navigated that storm, and has now rebounded, partly thanks to its vast user base. In the first quarter, revenue increased by 27% year over year to $36.5 billion. Its net income more than doubled to $12.4 billion.\n\nAnd the company benefits from the network effect. A website like Instagram becomes more valuable as more people use it -- the more people who are on it, the more useful it will be to them, and the more that people on the outside looking in will tend to want to join it. The same applies to Facebook. Meta Platforms has also proved to be an innovative company beyond AI. It is one of the leaders in virtual reality.\n\nInnovation, an economic moat in the form of the network effect, and growth potential in fields such as AI and online advertising make Meta Platforms an excellent forever stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "European Union's competition boss signals fresh AI scrutiny for Microsoft-OpenAI deal and Google",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The European Union is escalating its scrutiny of the artificial intelligence industry, including taking a fresh look into Microsoft's multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI, a top EU official said Friday.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, started reviewing the deal last year to see whether it broke EU merger rules but dropped it after concluding Microsoft hadn't gained control of OpenAI, Margrethe Vestager, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI over the years,\u201d she said \u201cBut we have to make sure that partnerships like this do not become a disguise for one partner getting a controlling influence over the other.\u201d\n\nShe signalled that the commission would take another tack to examine the deal, and the industry more broadly. It's using the bloc's antitrust rules, which target abusive behavior by companies that have a dominant market position.\n\nThe commission sent information requests in March to big AI players including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and TikTok, reviewed those replies and is \u201cnow sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI,\u201d Vestager said.\n\nThe EU wants \u201cto understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,\u201d she said.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said, \u201cWe appreciate the European Commission\u2019s thorough review and its conclusion that Microsoft\u2019s investment and partnership with OpenAI does not give Microsoft control over the company. We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have.\u201d\n\nOpenAI didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThe stepped-up scrutiny highlights how European Union regulators have been pacesetters for the global push to rein in big tech companies, including the major AI players. The EU's led the field with its AI Act, which is set to take effect soon and is the world\u2019s first comprehensive set of regulations for AI.\n\nVestager said the bloc was also concerned about consumer choices for foundation models, which is the technology that underpins generative AI systems like chatbots.\n\nShe said EU regulators have sent information requests \u201cto better understand the effects of Google\u2019s arrangement with Samsung\" to pre-install Gemini Nano on some devices from the South Korean tech company. Gemini Nano is the smallest version of Google's Gemini AI foundation model.\n\n\"And we have a number of other preliminary antitrust investigations ongoing into various practices in AI-related markets,\" she added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe commission is also examining so-called \u201cacqui-hires,\u201d where a company buys another one mainly for its talent, such as Microsoft's hiring of Inflection AI's founder Mustafa Suleyman, and other top staff.\n\n\u201cWe will make sure these practices don\u2019t slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\u201d she said.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of the\u00a0Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\n\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?\n\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is the biggest holding of the QQQ ETF, which is overbought based on the fund\u2019s RSI, according to BTIG research. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0RSI is 71.81, worse than 95.24% of 2921 companies in the Software industry.\n\nHowever, many Wall Street analysts are still bullish on the stock.\u00a0New Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.\n\nMicrosoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Growth continued in the first quarter, with revenue 5% higher and adjusted operating profits up 22%.\n\nWhere the garbage hauler shines is with its dividend. Although it yields a relatively low 1.5% annually, Waste Management has raised the payout at a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% for the past decade. Its dividend is sustainable because it has grown its free cash flow (FCF) at a healthy 4.4% annually over the same period (and at an even healthier 7.2% rate over the last five years).\n\nWaste Management\u2019s FCF payout ratio stands at 62%, slightly elevated but within its historical average, meaning plenty of cash is available for future dividend hikes.\n\nPool (POOL) Yellow pool float, ring floating in a refreshing blue swimming pool\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nAs its name suggests, Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) is a swimming pool supply and equipment company. Although the stock is down 22% year-to-date as economic conditions cause people to refrain from spending on new leisure time activities, there remain significant long-term growth opportunities.\n\nThe U.S. population is moving south to warmer climates. The U.S. Census Bureau says southern states saw their populations grow by more than 1.3 million people in 2022, up 1.1% from the prior year, making it the fastest-growing region in the country. That means more homes are being built there. Over 5 million new single-family homes were built in the U.S. between 2020 and mid-2023, most of them in southern and western states.\n\nAlthough a tough economy causes fewer people to splurge, it also means they will staycation at their homes more often. Adding a swimming pool adds value and leisure time activity. It\u2019s why Pool has seen sustained growth in sales and profits for the past decade.\n\nThe pool also rewards its shareholders with a rapidly rising dividend. The payout yields 1.6% annually but has increased at a 19% CAGR for the last 10 years. At the same time, FCF has grown 25% annually. With a very low 20% FCF payout ratio, Pool offers investors tremendous dividend growth opportunities.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the third stock to get rich from. Its fiscal third-quarter performance was particularly impressive as revenue grew 17% while net income surged 20% year-over-year. The advent of artificial intelligence supercharged Microsoft\u2019s business, turning this massive tech company into a growth stock once again.\n\nThat\u2019s no small feat for the most valuable stock on the market, worth $3.38 trillion. With AI suffused throughout all its products and services, Microsoft has a new lease on life. Particularly in its Azure cloud services business, where sector revenue jumped 20% from last year, the tech leader is attracting more and bigger companies to its platform. Almost half of all Fortune 500 companies use Azure AI models, and Microsoft now has 53,000 Azure AI customers.\n\nThough tech stocks aren\u2019t typically known for their dividend payments, Microsoft readily breaks the mold. Sure, the starting yield is a paltry 0.7%, but Microsoft has raised the dividend at a 10-year CAGR of 10%. Free cash flow has grown at nearly a similar rate, keeping the payout ratio at an easily manageable 33%. It also has a 22-year history of raising dividends, making Microsoft stock one to buy now if you want to get rich.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI could face an EU antitrust investigation as regulators singled out their exclusivity clauses while Google's artificial intelligence deal with Samsung also triggered scrutiny.\n\nEU antitrust regulators will seek additional third-party views, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday.\n\nThe moves underscore the unease among regulators worldwide on Big Tech leveraging its dominance into the new technology, echoing the companies' market power in other sectors.\n\nVestager in March sent questionnaires to Microsoft, Google, Meta's Facebook and ByteDance's TikTok as well as other big tech companies related to their AI partnerships.\n\n\"We have reviewed the replies, and are now sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI. To understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,\" she told a conference.\n\nReuters was first to report that EU regulators were building a case that could lead to an investigation into the partnership between the two companies.\n\n\"We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI will not be subject to EU merger rules because of the absence of control, Vestager said.\n\nWhile OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake.\n\nVestager also cited concerns about Big Tech blocking smaller AI developers from reaching users and businesses.\n\n\"We are also sending requests for information to better understand the effects of Google's arrangement with Samsung to pre-install its small model Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices,\" she said.\n\nGoogle in January reached a multi-year deal with the South Korean company to embed its generative artificial intelligence technology in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones.\n\nVestager also said she was looking into \"acqui-hires,\" where one company acquires another mainly for its talent, as exemplified in Microsoft's $650-million acquisition of startup Inflection in March that allowed it to use Inflection's models and hire most of its staff.\n\n\"We will make sure these practices don't slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this software maker have returned +9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.77 points to a change of +20% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.18 indicates a change of +12% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Microsoft.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for MSFT _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $64.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.2%. The $244.41 billion and $278.17 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.3% and +13.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMicrosoft reported revenues of $61.86 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. EPS of $2.94 for the same period compares with $2.45 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $60.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.02%. The EPS surprise was +4.63%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Simple Trading Strategies: 5 Rules for Buying Great Stocks",
        "content": "For the sophisticated investor, trading strategies involve technical analysis, exhaustive investment research and years of experience in the stock market. But there\u2019s no reason that everyday investors just looking to plan for retirement or protect their 401(k) investments have to feel like second-class citizens on Wall Street. Investing money in mutual funds or stocks is a serious business, but that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be overly complex.\n\nYes, online stock trading can be affected by a host of variables. And yes, all trading strategies need to adapt to the current stock market conditions. But by following these five simple rules for buying stocks, you can dramatically improve your chances of success. After all, simple trading strategies can sometimes be the most effective.\n\n1. Buy What You Know\n\nEach investor forms their own trading strategies and rules for buying stocks based on their personal goals and risk tolerance. And similarly, each investor buys and sells stocks and mutual funds based on what makes sense to them, right?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNot necessarily. The problem is that many investors fall victim to the latest fads on social media and dubious advice on investment websites, and they\u2019re eager to buy the stocks everyone else is talking about. This is how traders got taken for a ride by the dot-com bubble, as folks piled into stocks that hadn\u2019t yet turned a profit and that had no realistic way to make money.\n\nRemember Flooz.com, which pitched a kind of online currency that would serve as an alternative to credit cards?\n\nIt sounds like a crazy concept, but the company raised somewhere between $35 million and $50 million from investors and enlisted a few retail giants such as Barnes & Noble to join in. But at its core, Flooz was a glorified gift card company with limited partners. Three years after going public, Flooz was bankrupt \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t have surprised anyone who took a hard look at the company\u2019s business model.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, take Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a maker of semiconductors for electronics. Thanks largely to its revolutionary AI chip, Nvidia grew its revenue by 262% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. It also looks like the demand for AI chips will outpace supply for at least several months, so Nvidia is unlikely to drop anytime soon.\n\nNever underestimate the power of your personal experience. If you notice consumer trends or new products with big potential, chances are other folks will, too. This will help you anticipate investment trends and profit from them instead of chasing other people\u2019s stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Buy Stocks Great Investors Own\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a pitfall to relying on personal tastes alone. It\u2019s always valuable to have an outside perspective on your stocks to make sure you\u2019re on the right track. And if you want a second opinion, why not go right to the top and pick the brains of the best traders on Wall Street?\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Warren Buffett is a bit of a rock star to individual investors: His trading strategies and ways to invest money seem almost superhuman. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) makes timely and very profitable investments.\n\nIn May, Berkshire Hathaway came out on top again in a powerful earnings report. Its operating profit grew 39% from the previous year, and it reached a record-high cash hoard. How can individual investors enjoy similar success? Simple: Buy what Buffett buys.\n\nWhile it may be impossible to reproduce Warren Buffett\u2019s investment strategy \u2014 and it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll ever get the chance to pick his brain for stock tips, many of Buffett\u2019s investments are public record. Berkshire Hathaway must report its holdings quarterly; investments in equity securities are a regular feature of BRK holdings. And any stock that sees an influx of cash from Warren Buffett and company has trouble keeping it a secret due to the insatiable appetite for all things Buffett.\n\nTake Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of Buffett\u2019s longtime favorite stocks. Although he has occasionally sold off portions of his Apple holdings, Buffett has overall increased his shares over the past several years. By the end of 2017, Buffett held roughly 162.6 million shares in the company. By 2024, he held a staggering 905.6 million shares.\n\nAs for Apple\u2019s stock performance? While there have been some peaks and valleys, its growth has generally trended upward. On June 17, 2024, it reached an all-time high closing price of $216.67.\n\nThere is, of course, a danger to groupthink \u2014 and even Warren Buffett gets it wrong sometimes. It\u2019s worth noting that while Buffett may be America\u2019s favorite investor, there are a host of others with investment strategies worth watching. George Soros and Peter Lynch have been highly successful, and any investor could learn something from them.\n\n3. Buy Stocks for the Future, Not the Past\n\nSifting through quarterly reports and past performance for a company can provide insight into the health of a prospective investment. But it\u2019s important to realize that these numbers are lagging indicators. When you look for the best stocks to buy, you should put a premium on future growth trends over previous successes.\n\nConsider shifting demographics and evolving geopolitics, such as the fact that China became the top automobile sales market in the world in 2008. This was thanks to an emerging middle class in the People\u2019s Republic and lagging consumer confidence in the United States during the recession.\n\nChina\u2019s automotive industry is still the largest in the world, partially because the industry easily adapts to market trends; in recent years, China has been working on developing electric cars and cars with advanced safety systems.\n\nThat trend has led to rising stocks in the automotive sector. The most notable is BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), a Chinese manufacturer with a focus on electric cars. While it\u2019s had a few dips along the way, BYD is largely a growth stock \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t hurt that Warren Buffett is an investor, either.\n\nIf investors could tell the future, it would be easy to play the stock market. But there is no crystal ball that will provide answers as to which companies will see success and which ones won\u2019t.\n\nStill, you can increase your chances of sizable returns by doing your research. Remember that the stock market doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and real-world events can (and often do) inspire drastic changes. Ultimately, if you want to invest wisely, your rules for buying stocks should include focusing on future trends more than past successes.\n\n4. Buy Stocks With Great Leadership\n\nThe success or failure of a company relies in large part on the leadership and vision of its top executives. Growth comes from the top, not from random successes at a smattering of stores that trickle upwards. When you buy a stock, you have to realize that you\u2019re buying its management too.\n\nConsider the successes and failures of Apple over the last three decades. In the early 1990s, Apple was considered a second banana to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Windows rolled out cheaply and on a massive scale as Apple clung to high profit margins and a controlling, proprietary outlook.\n\nOn July 9, 1997, after three years of poor stock performance and crippling financial losses, the Apple board of directors placed Steve Jobs at the helm as CEO and began restructuring the company\u2019s product line.\n\nWhat followed over the next 10 years was a parade of Apple successes \u2014 the iMac, the iPod, iTunes, Apple retail stores and the iPhone. Apple took that popularity and ran with it, and its newfound success was almost entirely because of its new leadership. Steve Jobs may no longer be Apple\u2019s leader, but his legacy has shaped the company\u2019s C-suite and helped continue Apple\u2019s success.\n\nSure, there are stocks that succeed because they manage to cut costs and boost margins. But such a strategy can not keep a stock healthy and growing for long. If you want to invest intelligently, make sure your simple trading strategies include investing in smart leadership with a proven record of success and a willingness to challenge industry norms to get ahead.\n\n5. Buy Stocks With a Clear Plan to Sell\n\nYou might think that the best plan when buying a stock is simply to sell it for a profit, but many investors run out and buy \u201cgreat stocks\u201d without a clear plan for what their investment goal is and when they want to sell.\n\nThis practice can be brutal on your portfolio. After all, what is a great stock? Footwear manufacturer Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) was a great stock to buy in early 2007 at $23 a share \u2014 but only if you sold by October of that same year when prices were pushing $70, locking in your 200% gain.\n\nIf you held on a little longer, things didn\u2019t look as cheery: Crocs stock dropped to $10 around 2010. But if you decided to hold CROX until 2024, you would have been pleased. Currently, it trades for a much higher $154.74. Whether CROX was a great stock or not depends on your investing horizon and what you expected to get out of the stock.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a general sense of your investment timeline, you\u2019ll be stuck in an endless loop of uncertainty. You might be afraid to sell at a peak because you want to see if the stock rises more \u2014 and then find out that you waited too long. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you might rush to sell the stock at a peak and then see it continue to grow after you sell.\n\nShort-term traders who get greedy and refuse to sell can be just as bad as buy-and-hold investors who panic and sell too quickly. Many traders who sold off their stock when the market crashed in March 2009 not only locked in historic low valuations for the equities they sold but missed out on one of the biggest rallies in the market\u2019s history in mid-2009.\n\nWhatever your tactics \u2014 simple trading strategies or not \u2014 keep your goals clearly in mind before making any purchase. Set a reasonable price target or holding time for any asset, and use this investment strategy to color your decision. Simply knowing that a company is a great stock provides little consolation if you sell your shares too early or too late to make any money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sarah Edwards did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After a couple of rough years during which the sector underwent extensive restructuring, smart investors are once again paying attention to metaverse stocks.\n\nDue to higher spending and focus on AI, investors tend to ignore the metaverse, but the market is too substantial to ignore, expected to be worth about $116.74 billion in 2024 and $669.96 billion by 2029, growing at a rate of 41.83% per year. McKinsey & Companyestimates a $5 trillion metaverse economy by 2030.\n\nPart of the allure of metaverse stocks is that the concept has several use cases; for example, the U.S. military and government are studying metaverse applications, including augmented reality training simulations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the same time, for companies, the metaverse concept is still relevant post-pandemic, considering the secular growth in the work-from-home trend; roughly 12.7% of full-time employees globally work from home and more remote work means the metaverse can be crucial to future workflow management.\n\nHowever, since this is still a developing sector, it\u2019s best to select metaverse stocks with solid analyst ratings, healthy financials, diversified portfolios, and healthy upside potential.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a pick-and-shovel play for those interested in purchasing metaverse stocks, commanding a dominant 88% market share in the discrete GPU market.\n\nNVDA powers virtual and augmented reality, and its diverse operating model gives investors peace of mind; NVDA is a \u201cstrong buy\u201d stock with a 25% upside.\n\nBesides the hardware Nvidia is offering, Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse software helps create and test virtual environments in real-time. Recent Blender and Adobe integrations provide Omniverse\u2019s functionality to millions more users. Blender supports USD, and Adobe\u2019s Substance 3D simplifies material changes.\n\nNVIDIA has also teamed up with several big names to promote metaverse technology. For instance, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) practices wildfire response using Omniverse. Omniverse helps SHoP Architectscollaborate on building plans in real-time and create gorgeous visualizations.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA leads neural graphics, which blend AI with traditional images to speed up and improve virtual environments. Instant NeRF and other breakthroughs convert 2D images into 3D scenes, speeding up metaverse material creation.\u200b\n\nUltimately, due to its speed and low power consumption, RTX technology is easier for design, visualization, and AI-accelerated tool professionals. For example, the RTX 4000 SFF GPU from NVIDIA lets AR and VR apps draw and visualize at unparalleled speeds for compact computers, giving investors an additional point to invest.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox\u2019s (NYSE:RBLX) new creator roadmap covers ways to make creating simpler and more immersive, containing new features and capabilities to improve platform development and user experience, making it a good pick among metaverse stocks, with a 15% potential upside.\n\nIn addition, Roblox released its Q1 2024 financial figures, which showed that its sales rose 22% year-over-year to $801.3 million. There were 19% more bookings, for a total of $923.8 million. Roblox recorded a net loss of $270.6 million, which is a little more than the same time last year, even though sales went up. However, the results mark the third time in a row RBLX went past Wall Street estimates, displaying post-pandemic robustness.\n\nIn addition, Ikearecently announced a new concept for employing virtual workers in its Roblox metaverse shop. In \u201cThe Co-Worker Game,\u201d virtual laborers work in the caf\u00e9 and showroom. London online jobs cost \u00a313.15 per hour. This method aims to engage younger people and provide them with a digital shopping experience.\n\nThe NHL has also digitally constructed the 2024 All-Star Game in Roblox, the first major sports league to do so. Fans may engage with the game in a 3D virtual environment, improving the viewing experience and attracting more fans to the sport and Roblox.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background..

        "content": "This article looks at the most expensive place to live in the US. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 26 Most Expensive Places To Live in the US.\n\nAmerican consumers are facing the burgeoning impact of rising prices like never before. The cost of living in the United States has increased significantly since the pandemic, with goods and services that cost $100 before the coronavirus now worth around $120, according to a report in Bloomberg in November 2023. Prices over the last 3-4 years in the country have risen nearly as much as in the decade before the pandemic.\n\nA 2023 survey by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) revealed that more than two-thirds (67%) of the employees felt that inflation was rising at a quicker pace than their income, which reemphasized the stressful impact of the cost of living crisis on American citizens. The figure was up from 58% in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s last survey held in 2022. To tackle inflation and ensure the financial wellness of its employees, the company last year announced to raise its minimum wage from $22 to $23 and has plans to increase it further to $25 by 2025, which would ensure that all Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) employees make at least $48,000 per year.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) too has been actively making cost of living adjustments to wages of its employees amid increasing cost of living. Last September, it raised the hourly wage of its delivery and warehouse workers to $20.5 per hour from $19. The company has been striving to enhance the financial well-being of its employees for quite some time now, beginning first in 2018, when Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) declared a minimum wage of $15, which was then twice the amount of the federal minimum wage in the United States. While announcing the raise, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s executives also stated that they would engage policymakers nationwide to increase the minimum wage within their jurisdictions, at both the federal and state level.\n\nHaving said that, while some companies can increase wages, most others are not able to due to the financial challenges ahead of them. One example of that is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which after doubling the merit increases for certain employees in 2022, held back on raising the salaries of full-time employees in 2023 citing business priorities and corporate challenges. The freeze in raises has continued for well over a year now at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nLayoffs have also been on the rise in the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the last couple of years, following growing pressure from investors after recording its slowest revenue growth (2%) in six years during the last quarter of 2022. Since then, the company\u2019s stock price has increased 87% from $236.6 per share on January 3, 2023, to its current level of $442.47. Its diluted earnings per share (EPS) also marginally increased from $9.65 in 2022 to $9.65 in 2023. Workforce reductions and a freeze on merit increases have likely contributed to an improvement in the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) last year decided to slash the salaries of its employees between 5-25% depending on their position, due to a lower forecasted sale and loss of market share. Wages of hourly workers remained unaffected. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\u2019s CEO Pat Gelsinger was among those whose salaries got cut.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered consensus methodology to rank the 26 most expensive places to live in the US by averaging city cost of living index scores on two sources: Numbeo and Best Places. The most expensive places to live in the US are ranked in ascending order of their average cost of living index scores, with New York City set as the benchmark to compare against. We have also referred to other sources such as Expatistan, RentCafe, and Payscale for various statistics related to the cost of living for each city, which you will be reading in the lists section.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). The Most Expensive Place to Live in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nThe most expensive place to live in the US is San Francisco!\n\n1. San Francisco, California\n\nAverage Cost of Living Index: 118\n\nSan Francisco is the most expensive place to live in the US, with the median house prices hovering around $1.3 million within the city. According to Payscale, the overall cost of living in the city is 79% more than the national average, with housing being a staggering 207% more expensive. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to see people moving out of the city or looking for accommodation in San Francisco\u2019s outskirts due to the high cost of living.\n\nTo learn about other places with a high cost of living, check out our detailed report 26 Most Expensive Places To Live in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the cost of living to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are announcing new AI-enabled services. This truly historic event opens up new growth potential for investors looking for AI stocks.\n\nEvery day, new growth and value stocks are emerging, most of them relatively unknown. A key metric used to find these companies is analyst growth predictions. These include increasing EPS predictions and high price targets. It also includes financial analysis. This includes analyzing gross margins, cash flow, and other financial data in context with the company\u2019s operations at the time. Another key factor is the analysis of growth catalysts. This range from the introduction of new products and services, to mergers, new deals, etc.\n\nAll this information allows us to decently estimate growth stocks, and the three companies discussed today fit this perfectly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) is a relatively new company engaged in the market for autonomous food delivery robots. Its products work primarily in dense, urban environments such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The stock spiked on June 21, rising 7.53%, but analysts predict growth multiple times that.\n\nSERV is currently still starting out; it has an operating margin of -814.55%. While it is currently making a loss, analysts are bullish about this company for a few key reasons. One such reason is that SERV has seen year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 2,252%. It has also strong leadership changes, with new roles being created in order to fill the needs of a growing company. It also has industry-wide backing, with a combined 44.27% of outstanding shares being held by institutions or insiders. The company also enjoys the support of UberEats, Nvidia, and 7-11, among others.\n\nA wide corporate backing, great growth, and an analyst growth estimate of over 2000% make this stock an immediate buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), often known as the \u201cGoogle of China,\u201d is a Chinese tech company specializing in AI and internet services. It invests in AI technologies like autonomous driving, voice recognition, and cloud services through initiatives like Baidu Apollo and Baidu Brain. It also holds a significant position in China\u2019s search engine market.\n\nBIDU stock is currently trading at $88.22 with a market cap of $31.1 billion. The company has seen steady revenue increase over the past four years, increasing by 25% from $107 billion in 2020 to $134.6 billion in 2023. The company has seen positive profit and operating margins of 14.77% and 17.40%, and has also consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past four quarters by a huge margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu has products in a number of industries, which proves it immune to an industry slump. Several financial institutions rated the company as \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cpositive.\u201d. Strong financials, a diverse product base, and investor confidence make BIDU on of the strongest undiscovered AI stocks.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides an end-to-end automation platform with robotic process automation (RPA) solutions across the U.S., Romania, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and globally. It offers software to build, manage, run, engage, measure, and govern automation within organizations.\n\nPATH stock is currently trading at $12.22 with a market cap of $7 billion. PATH is down 48.66% year-to-date, and I expect this negative trend to reverse anytime. While PATH\u2019s financials do raise some red flags, such as its negative profit and operating margin of -6.41% and -14.76%, the company is poised for growth in the future. Analysts have set an average price target of $16.00 for the stock, indicating a potential increase of 31.00% \u2013 suggesting the stock is underpriced.\n\nThe company issued its Fiscal Year 2024 Impact Report last week, resulting in an 8.91% increase in its stock.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 industries in the world in 2024and in this article, we'll shed light on the top one.\n\nNavigating the Global Economic Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities in 2024\n\nThe global economy has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, particularly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery efforts. In the decade leading up to the pandemic, the global economy experienced steady growth, averaging around 3.8% annually.\n\nThe world saw its worst economic fall since the Great Depression as a result of the outbreak. The global GDP shrank by 3.0% in 2020, which was a sharp contrast to the 2.8% increase in 2019. The decline of international trade was one of the main causes of this economic crisis. The epidemic led to a sharp reduction in global trade, which made the general downturn in economic performance worse. Due to the interconnectedness of the global economy, disturbances in one area of the world could have a cascading effect on other regions and sectors, creating a series of economic issues.\n\nIn 2024, the OECD projects a severe slowdown in global economic growth, with rates of decline below historical averages. The growth rate is predicted to decrease to 2.7% in 2024 from 2.9% in 2023. The IMF also predicts a slowdown, with 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024\u2014both significantly below the historical average of 3.8%.\n\nA more upbeat forecast for the world economy in 2024 is provided by Goldman Sachs Research, which projects 2.6% GDP growth. They anticipate steady income growth, declining inflation, a strong labor market, and a revival of manufacturing. Interest rate reductions by central banks are expected to act as a buffer against recession. Most major economies, including the US, are predicted to do well as they transition from managing inflation to reducing the danger of recession.\n\nIn 2024, there will be possibilities and challenges in the global industrial market for several different industries. The US industrial sector is expected to gain a great deal of legislative help. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has caused investment in the manufacturing of semiconductors and clean technologies to nearly triple since 2021. More than 75,000 new employees, $88 billion in investments, and approximately 200 new clean technology manufacturing sites have resulted from this. The industrial sector's yearly construction spending as of July 2023 was $201 billion, up 70% from the previous year and suggesting promising growth in 2024.\n\nInternational trade markets also continue to be robust. A $500 billion growth in trade in services illustrates adaptability despite a predicted 5% downturn. Geopolitical reasons are driving the integration of developing economies, such as Mexico and East Asian countries, into global supply chains.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith 18 of the 20 fastest-growing trade routes, Asia continues to dominate the global economy, accounting for over 50% of trade value. This trend is particularly evident in trade between China and the UAE, where non-oil commerce is expected to reach $72 billion in 2022, representing an 18% growth, and overall bilateral trade reaching $99.3 billion.\n\nBiggest Companies Revolutionizing the Global Economy\n\nBiggest companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron, JP Morgan, Visa, and Johnson & Johnson, among many others, have been making trends in the global economy. For Example, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational technology company that plays a significant role in the global economy through its diverse range of products and services, substantial economic contributions, and innovative advancements. Microsoft's partner ecosystem and cloud services are major drivers of economic growth. Microsoft forecasts that artificial intelligence (AI) could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. This projection underscores the transformative potential of AI in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and agriculture. In Africa alone, AI could generate $1.2 trillion, representing a 5.6% increase in the continent's GDP by 2030. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has pledged to equip 10 million people from underserved communities with digital skills for jobs in the digital economy by 2025. Additionally, Microsoft aims to skill and recruit 250,000 people into the US cybersecurity workforce by 2025, addressing significant workforce shortages in this critical area. In Q1 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) generated $56.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and the reported operating income for the same period stood at $26.9 billion, an increase of 25%.\n\nSimilarly, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the oldest and most prominent players in the global oil and gas industry, with a significant impact on the global economy.\u00a0 In 2022, ExxonMobil, its divisions and affiliates, employees, retirees, and the ExxonMobil Foundation collectively provided $158 million in contributions and community investments worldwide. Of this total, $41 million supported U.S. communities, and $91 million supported communities in other countries.

        "title": "Huawei's Harmony aims to end China's reliance on Windows, Android",
        "content": "By David Kirton\n\nSHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Packed into a small room, a drone, bipedal robot, supermarket checkout and other devices showcase a vision of China's software future - one where an operating system developed by national champion Huawei has replaced Windows and Android.\n\nThe collection is at the Harmony Ecosystem Innovation Centre in the southern city of Shenzhen, a local government-owned entity that encourages authorities, companies and hardware makers to develop software using OpenHarmony, an open-source version of the operating system Huawei launched five years ago after U.S. sanctions cut off support for Google's Android.\n\nWhile Huawei's recent strong-selling smartphone launches have been closely watched for signs of advances in China's chip supply chain, the company has also quietly built up expertise in sectors crucial to Beijing's vision of technology self-sufficiency from operating systems to in-vehicle software.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping last year told the Communist Party's elite politburo that China must wage a difficult battle to localise operating systems and other technology \"as soon as possible\" as the U.S. cracks down on exports of advanced chips and other components.\n\nOpenHarmony is now being widely promoted within China as a \"national operating system\" amid concerns that other major companies could be severed from the Microsoft Windows and Android products upon which many systems rely.\n\n\"This strategic move will likely erode the market share of Western operating systems like Android and Windows in China, as local products gain traction,\" said Sunny Cheung, an associate fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S. defence policy group.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Huawei's HarmonyOS, the company's in-house version of the operating system, surpassed Apple's iOS to become the second best-selling mobile operating system in China behind Android, research firm Counterpoint said. It has not been launched on smartphones outside China.\n\nHuawei no longer controls OpenHarmony, having gifted its source code to a non-profit called the OpenAtom Foundation in 2020 and 2021, according to an internal memo and other releases.\n\nBut both the innovation centre and government documents often refer to OpenHarmony and HarmonyOS interchangeably as part of a broader Harmony ecosystem. The growth of HarmonyOS, expected to be rolled out in a PC version this year or next, will spur adoption of OpenHarmony, analysts said.\n\n\"Harmony has created a powerful foundational operating system for the future of China's devices,\" said Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei's consumer business group, at the opening of a developer conference last week.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei did not respond to a request for further comment.\n\nSELF-SUFFICIENCY\n\nHuawei first unveiled Harmony in August 2019, three months after Washington placed it under trade restrictions over alleged security concerns. Huawei denies its equipment poses a risk.\n\nSince then, China has stepped up its self-sufficiency efforts, cutting itself off from the main code sharing hub Github and championing a local version, Gitee.\n\nChina banned the use of Windows on government computers in 2014 and they now use mostly Linux-based operating systems.\n\nMicrosoft earns only about 1.5% of its revenue from China, its president said this month.\n\nOriginally built on an open source Android system, this year Huawei launched its first \"pure\" version of HarmonyOS that no longer supports Android-based apps, in a move that further bifurcates China's app ecosystem from the rest of the world.\n\nA report from the Jamestown Foundation last month said OpenHarmony's owner OpenAtom appeared to be coordinating efforts among Chinese firms to develop a viable alternative to U.S. technologies, including for defence applications such as satellites.\n\nBeijing-based OpenAtom did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOPEN SOURCE\n\nOpenHarmony was the fastest-growing open-source operating system for smart devices last year, with more than 70 organisations contributing to it and more than 460 hardware and software products built across finance, education, aerospace and industry, Huawei said in its 2023 annual report.\n\nThe aim of making it open source is to replicate Android's success in removing licensing costs for users and to give companies a customisable springboard for their own products, said Charlie Cheng, deputy manager of the Harmony Ecosystem Innovation Centre, when Reuters visited.\n\n\"Harmony will definitely grow into a mainstream operating system, and will give the world a new choice of operating system besides iOS and Android,\" he said. \"China is learning from the West.\"\n\nGoogle, Apple and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Harmony ecosystem has seen strong support from Huawei's home city of Shenzhen, a city historically used as a trial site for policies later adopted across China.\n\nAlong with a Harmony centre that opened in the southwestern city of Chengdu, 10 more are expected in a further 10 cities, according to a Shenzhen centre presentation.\n\nKey OpenHarmony developers include Shenzhen Kaihong Digital, headed by Wang Chenglu, a former Huawei employee known as Harmony's \"godfather\", and Chinasoft. Both have worked on infrastructure software, at Tianjin Port and for mines in China's top coal-producing province Shaanxi.\n\nWhile OpenHarmony is largely confined to China, Brussels-based open-source group the Eclipse Foundation said it was using it to develop a system called Oniro for use in mobile phones and internet-of-things devices.\n\nChina's previous efforts to build major open-source projects have struggled to gain traction among developers, but Huawei's growing smartphone market share and extra work to develop a broader ecosystem gives Harmony an advantage, analysts said.\n\nMore than 900 million devices, including smartphones, watches and car systems are running on HarmonyOS, while 2.4 million developers were coding in the ecosystem, Huawei's Yu said this month.\n\n\"OpenHarmony will need more time and iterations so that these developers will be more confident to work with OpenHarmony,\" said Emma Xu, an analyst with research firm Canalys. \"But the reputation, behaviour and confidence that HarmonyOS has achieved will definitely bring a positive effect.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Kirton; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The news of the U.S. government\u2019s allegations has shaken the financial sector. Adobe is at the center of a criticism storm from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which claims that the company concealed the cost of canceling its subscription plan. When trying to unsubscribe, Photoshop, Acrobat and Illustrator users faced the need to pay several hundred dollars. The FTC-Adobe lawsuit is currently underway in a federal court in California, putting the company\u2019s reputation at risk, which has been offering similar subscription options since 2012.\n\nAdobe will not give up and will defend the legitimacy of its actions. According to the company\u2019s representatives, the three subscription options met users\u2019 needs for convenient and flexible payment terms. The company is determined to continue pursuing its transparency policy and keep the bar high regarding positive user experience.\n\nThe dispute may be resolved in the judicial space in favor of either party. However, the company\u2019s reputation will likely suffer in both cases. Concerned investors are looking for ways to reallocate shares in their portfolios before making a final decision.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced technologies require constant injections of funds to support research, so it\u2019s not a surprise that competitors in this area are companies with big market capitalization. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) competes with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and creative software solutions. Any legal problems one of these companies faces, such as the FTC-Adobe lawsuit, benefits the other company. Integrating Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform with artificial intelligence tools has pushed Adobe Sensei out of the way and made it a comprehensive cloud services platform. Dynamics 365 competes directly with Adobe Experience Cloud, and the latest integration with Azure services plays into its hands.\n\nIn a month, the industry titan made a breakthrough that allowed the stock to rise by 5.3%. The integration of OpenAI technologies plays an important role in this rise. ChatGPT has significantly enhanced the capabilities and accuracy of Microsoft products. Expanded integration between Windows computers and Android smartphones has improved cross-platform compatibility and new users, increasing revenue potential. This aligns with consensus sales forecasts of +14.2% year-on-year and a revenue increase of 13.8% for the next fiscal year.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Adobe is a leader in digital experience and marketing automation software, the FTC-Adobe lawsuit could provide additional opportunities for a company like Salesforce (NASDAQ:CRM), as its cloud-based solutions are key to the customer relationship management market. With a set of cloud applications, the CRM platform can attract customers with solutions for sales, service, marketing and commerce. The addition of Slack and Tableau to the company has concentrated the lion\u2019s share of collaboration and data analysis tools in its hands. In addition, Einstein AI can occupy the niche of automating routine tasks and increasing the productivity of sales and marketing departments.\n\nSalesforce is known among investors for its stable financial performance and growing presence in CRM solutions and cloud services. In the last quarter, the company took advantage of its broad customer base and surpassed the $9.13 billion mark in revenue. This figure exceeded the previous year\u2019s value by 10.7%, which is why earnings per share reached $2.44. Analysts have high expectations for the second quarter, with their estimates pointing to a projected revenue growth of 7.4%.\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle Cloud, Adobe Experience Cloud and Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are challenging Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) to dominate the cloud computing industry. However, the company finds solutions each time, allowing it to continue competing for industry leadership. Amid the FTC-Adobe lawsuit, Oracle\u2019s value is growing as it leverages its partners\u2019 infrastructure to create innovative products. It is expanding in international markets by establishing local data centers. Proactively driving innovation is especially important to thrive in Europe, where other major players are fighting for users. Oracle\u2019s investment plan includes investing more than $1 billion in Spain over the next decade.\n\nWith the creation of the third Cloud Region in Madrid, the company will continue implementing the country\u2019s broader digital transformation goals. This is expected to be facilitated by its cooperation with Telefonica Espa\u00f1a, among others. More than 100 cloud services and a focus on industry-specific solutions (financial services) demonstrate Oracle\u2019s adaptability to modern conditions. Revenue for the fourth quarter of last year amounted to $14.29 billion, confirming the chosen strategy\u2019s correctness. A 12% increase in revenues from cloud services and license support led to % overall growth of 6%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Julia Magas did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Stock Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to enjoy a solid run as the improving macro environment, coupled with the AI optimism and recent stock upgrades, provides solid support for risk assets.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600, up from the previous target of 5,200.\n\nThis revision by one of the most important financial institutions is attributed to robust earnings growth from five major U.S. technology companies and a higher projected fair value price-to-earnings ratio multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have seen a combined surge of 45%, now representing 25% of the S&P 500\u2019s equity capitalization.\n\nGoldman points to upward adjustments in the 2024 earnings estimates for these tech companies and valuation increases driven by growing investor excitement around artificial intelligence. The broker anticipates that stable real yields by the end of the year and strong earnings performance will justify a 15x P/E ratio for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index.\n\nHowever, the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November poses a significant risk to the S&P 500\u2019s levels, as historically, index volatility has increased leading up to the election. Post-election, the trend typically reverses, with the index recovering to higher levels.\n\nThe news that Goldman lifted its target came as Evercore ISI also revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 on Sunday, setting it to Street-high 6,000, up from 4,750. The firm expects an 8% earnings growth in 2023, bolstered by the potential of the AI \u201crevolution.\u201d\n\nAs valuation models are refreshed to account for higher multiples, we look at 3 hottest stock upgrades from last week.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Known for its innovative products and strong brand, Nike consistently delivers strong financial performance and growth potential, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) upgraded its rating for Nike, shifting from a neutral \u201cPerform\u201d stance to a more bullish \u201cOutperform.\u201d Alongside the stock upgrades, the firm also increased its price target for the sportswear giant\u2019s shares from $110.00 to $120.00.\n\nThe stock upgrades come after a period when Nike faced a series of challenges that impacted its sales growth and profit margins. According to Oppenheimer, these difficulties included a mix of external and internal factors that have now been largely accounted for in the company\u2019s current stock price and financial projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the current market valuation of Nike\u2019s shares and the short-term financial expectations have become \u201cderisked.\u201d This term indicates that the risks previously associated with Nike\u2019s performance are now reflected in its stock price, setting a stage for potential recovery.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is a leading retailer of electronics, appliances and tech services. With a broad product range and strong market presence, it attracts investors seeking exposure to consumer electronics and retail sectors.\n\nRecently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded shares of Best Buy, moving the rating from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy.\u201d Accompanying the stock upgrades, the firm also increased the price target for the retailer\u2019s stock to $106 from the previous $85. The stock upgrades come with a positive outlook from UBS on Best Buy\u2019s potential performance over the next 18 months.\n\nUBS identified several factors that could drive the company\u2019s sales upward. These include an anticipated improvement in housing trends, which typically correlate with appliance sales, and a pending electronics replacement cycle that occurs every four to seven years.\n\nMoreover, the firm expects product innovation, particularly involving artificial intelligence, to boost sales by an average of approximately 200 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, UBS highlighted Best Buy\u2019s expansion into new product categories, such as e-bikes and furniture, as a potential growth avenue. The firm predicts that these elements combined could lead to a robust recovery in Best Buy\u2019s sales in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a major producer of aluminum, known for its mining, refining and smelting operations. Its position in the industrial metals sector and focus on sustainability make it an appealing investment for those interested in materials and infrastructure growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) revisited its recommendations on mining companies, lifting ratings on Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Analysts upgraded Alcoa from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d setting a new price target of $50.00, up from the previous $36.50.\n\nThe stock upgrades come against the backdrop of disruptions in the global alumina supply, which are expected to keep prices elevated. The broker pointed out that approximately 5.9 million tonnes of alumina capacity disruptions have occurred, accounting for about 10% of the global supply outside of China.\n\nThese disruptions, coupled with China\u2019s increased need to import alumina, are anticipated to tighten the global supply and sustain higher alumina prices than historical averages, potentially reaching $500 in the second half of 2024 and $385 in 2025.\n\nThe situation is also expected to constrain China\u2019s aluminum production, despite the country\u2019s plans to restart some operations. Morgan Stanley\u2019s projections suggest aluminum prices could be supported at $1.22 in the latter half of 2024 and $1.12 in 2025. This outlook appears to be a driving factor behind the positive sentiment on Alcoa\u2019s stock.\n\nAdditionally, Freeport-McMoRan received an upgrade from \u201cEqual Weight\u201d to \u201cOverweight,\u201d with the price target being lifted to $62.00 from the former $49.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 7 Smartest Growth Stocks to Buy with $500 Right Now",
        "content": "You don\u2019t need much money to invest in the stock market. Fractional investing makes it possible to invest in any company,\u00a0even\u00a0if you do not have enough cash to buy an entire share.\n\nWhile stock investors can get wealthy by picking the right stocks, it ultimately comes down to regularly contributing to your portfolio. Did you find a stock that\u2019s going to double this year? That will only turn your $1,000 portfolio into a $2,000 one. Once you get up to a $100,000 portfolio, a doubling and any incremental gain start to mean much more.\n\nRegularly investing in your portfolio is a common path to achieving long-term financial goals. If you only have $500 to invest, you may benefit from putting that cash to work in one of these compelling growth stocks to buy, or you could use the power of fractional shares to get at least a portion of each. These picks feature rising revenue and plenty of long-term catalysts that can support further acceleration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s been hard to bet against\u00a0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) since CEO Mark Zuckerberg strongly focused on efficiency. Revenue growth remains elevated while net income continues to soar. Facebook\u2019s parent company reported strong results in the first quarter. Revenue increased by 27% from a year ago, while net income surged by 117%.\n\nRising profit margins will continue to strengthen the firm\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, which currently stands at 28.5x. Given the company\u2019s tremendous growth and dominance in the online advertising, it\u2019s a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has some of the most popular social networks under its corporate umbrella, and they have delivered astonishing gains for its investors.\n\nMeta Platforms stock gained 43% year-to-date and has rallied by 159% over the past five years. Analysts have been rushing to raise their price targets as the\u00a0\u201cstrong buy\u201d pick continues to rise. The average price target suggests a 6% upside from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-diversified corporations on the stock market. It exposes investors to many growing industries, and Microsoft is gaining market share in many of them. Artificial intelligence continues to capture headlines, and the company has taken advantage of the opportunity. Microsoft Cloud and Copilot are two of the company\u2019s catalysts for AI.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud, in particular, has been a big winner for the company. Cloud revenue increased by 23% from a year ago to reach $35.1 billion in\u00a0in the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter of 2024. That\u2019s more than half of the company\u2019s revenue in the quarter. Microsoft reported $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year ago. Net income increased by 20% to reach $21.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street is bullish on Microsoft, and analysts have given it a\u00a0\u201cstrong buy\u201d rating. The average price suggests an 11% upside from current levels. Microsoft has been consistently outperforming the market for many years. It logged a 21% year-to-date gain and has jumped by 228% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a historic tear, soaring by more than 3,200% over the past five years. The chipmaker is at the forefront of the AI boom and has a comfortable lead over its competitors.\n\nWhile investors know that Nvidia can\u2019t maintain triple-digit revenue growth rates forever, the firm is still maintaining that growth rate. Revenue surged by 262% year-over-year in\u00a0the first quarter of fiscal 2025,\u00a0while\u00a0net income was up by 628%. Both growth rates comfortably exceed the stock\u2019s 194% gain over the past year.\n\nNvidia is one of the few high-growth corporations that are keeping up with its growth. Recent gains are backed by impressive revenue and earnings growth rates. Nvidia briefly became the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded corporation and will likely reclaim that crown. The stock has a $3.1 trillion market cap and trades at a P/E of 74x.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The word \"hello\" is written in a variety of languages in a handwritten style.\n\nSource: Anna Kutukova / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don\u2019t have to narrow your search to multi-trillion-dollar tech companies to find compelling opportunities in the stock market. Some corporations are much smaller and have market caps below $10 billion.\u00a0Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) certainly fits this description.\n\nThe stock is barely down year-to-date and has logged a 45% gain over the past year. The company has strong financials and rising profit margins. The only weakness is the educational tech firm\u2019s P/E of 214x, but that should improve soon. The language learning app reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth and $27 million in profits in\u00a0the first quarter. In the same quarter last year, Duolingo lost $2.6 million.\n\nA rapidly growing user base forms the foundation for future growth. Daily active users were up by 54% from a year ago while monthly active users increased by 35%. With 97.6 million monthly active users at the end of the first quarter, it\u2019s likely for Duolingo to exceed 100 million monthly active users in its next quarterly report. The app also has 31.4 million daily active users.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is innovating the brokerage industry. The firm started moving toward commission-free stock trades and has a few resources to help it stand out.\n\nRobinhood seems to be swinging for the fences with\u00a0Robinhood Gold. The number of benefits in this plan suggests that other brokerage firms and traditional banks will have to offer better products and services to catch up.\n\nRobinhood Gold offers many products that the average consumer will find difficult to resist. You can receive 1% back on all qualifying deposits, a credit card that offers unlimited 3% cashback on all purchases, zero interest on the first $1,000 of margin, lower margin rates than most of the competition, 3% IRA matching on every dollar each year, and more.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder the stock has doubled over the past year. Recent financials were also great. Revenue increased by 40% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter while net income more than doubled.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) The Brazilian flag with the sun in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is another fintech firm worth monitoring. The Brazilian digital bank gained 51% in 2024 and is rated as a \u201cstrong buy\u201d among Wall Street analysts. The average price target suggests a 12% upside, while the highest price target indicates that a 22% gain is possible.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the gains and strong investor sentiment? The company\u2019s\u00a0first-quarter earnings offer a glimpse into the excitement. Revenue increased by 69% from a year ago, while net income soared by 167%. The firm reported a 43.2% gross profit margin.\n\nA booming customer base has supported the bank\u2019s expansion as it taps into loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and other financial services. The company closed out the first quarter with 99.3 million customers, a 26% year-over-year improvement. That\u2019s also up sequentially from 93.9 million customers in Q4 2023. More than 80% of Nu Holdings\u2019 customers are active.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nEveryone needs sneakers, and there\u2019s plenty of competition in the industry. However, newer companies like\u00a0Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) are gaining market share from their larger rivals. You may not know the company by its corporate name, but you may have heard of Hoka and Ugg. Deckers Outdoor is the parent company of those brands.\n\nThe athletic apparel company is currently rated as a\u00a0\u201cmoderate buy\u201d and has a projected 8% upside from current levels. Shares are up 45% year-to-date and have soared 459% over the past five years. The company\u2019s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 brought more attention to the stock.\n\nDeckers Outdoor shined in its first quarterly report as a corporation listed in the S&P 500. The firm reported 21.2% year-over-year net sales growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Domestic and international sales had double-digit growth rates\u00a0with\u00a0Hoka leading the way. The company\u2019s profits increased by 39% year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, NVDA, and DECK.

        "title": "Too Late to Buy Nvidia? 3 Stocks to Double Down on Instead.",
        "content": "Is the AI rally over for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? The dominant AI chipmaker has fallen 10% from its all-time high and has now slipped back to the third most valuable stock on the market behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestors, though, should probably just view it as the pause that refreshes. Nvidia stock is just taking a breather before its next run higher. With CEO Jensen Huang declaring \u201cwe are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution\u201d due to corporate demand for AI, there will be no let up in Nvidia\u2019s growth potential.\n\nYet, because the stock still trades at 71 times trailing earnings, 33 times next year\u2019s estimates and 37 times sales, Nvidia is not cheap. If you missed the run-up in the chipmaker\u2019s stock (sheepishly raises hand), don\u2019t worry. There are still other AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia that can generate outsized returns for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat is why you just might want to double down on three stocks below. They might not generate 3,000% returns in five years as NVDA stock did but that doesn\u2019t mean you can create fabulous wealth with these AI stocks today.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first choice for any investor looking for AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia would have to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It is the one chipmaker perfectly positioned to challenge the industry leader, and in many respects is already doing so.\n\nIn just the two months since AMD released its AI-driven MI300X accelerator for data centers, the chipmaker already generated some $1.5 billion in sales. That\u2019s not Nvidia-level revenue but AMD is only just getting started.\u00a0 Data center revenue surged 80% in the first quarter, jumping to $2.3 billion from the year-ago period causing segment operating profits to more than triple to $541 million.\n\nAnd not content to rest on its laurels, Advanced Micro already has the next iteration of the accelerator ready to go. In the fourth quarter the chipmaker will release the Instinct MI325X accelerator that will take its AI capabilities to the next level.\n\nA lot of AMD\u2019s growth will occur in the back half of the year. The semiconductor stock forecasts data center revenue will exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from its previous guidance of $3.5 billion. And the company is stealing market share from both Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It owns one-third of the market and it is quickly padding its share.\n\nExpect Advanced Micro Devices stock to accelerate growth later this year and then continue a meteoric rise thereafter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nThe reason Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the second AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia is because it is the chip foundry from where Nvidia gets its chips. If there is any company that will grow alongside the AI chip stock best it is TSM.\n\nMoreover, all the leading AI semiconductor manufacturers get their chips from Taiwan Semi, including Advanced Micro and Intel. The company has so much demand for its services that it can\u2019t keep up with it and has had to expand manufacturing capacity. There are three new chip facilities planned to come online in the U.S. over the next few years.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked picks-and-shovels-type investments. They are the behind-the-scenes stocks that allow you to avoid trying to pick the winners and losers. They are willing to sell to anyone wanting to pan for gold, so whichever stock emerges victorious they benefit from it and the others. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is just such a play, though arguably not in the same sense as most people think of these stocks.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 13% to $18.9 billion with rich profit margins across the board. Gross margins were 53%, operating margins were 42.1% and net margins came in at 38%.\n\nThe stock has doubled in value over the past year. Yet as AI demand maintains it white-hot pace look for TSM to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation of its own.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nI tend to not invest in exchange-traded funds (ETF) but in the same vein as Taiwan Semi is a picks-and-shovels stock on the AI chip trade, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) is a top AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. Or rather, you will be buying Nvidia and all the other AI chip stocks out there.\n\nWith ETFs, of course, you\u2019re buying a basket of companies. Just like TSM, you\u2019re not trying to pick winners and losers but buying all the players (generally speaking). It doesn\u2019t matter who wins because there will be many winners and VanEck Semiconductor will likely hold them all.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia is SMH\u2019s largest holding, comprising 19.4% of the portfolio. The next biggest is TSM at 12.8% but it also owns hard-charging Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) (7.9%), Advanced Micro (5.2%) and clean equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) (4.8%).\n\nIn reality, any of those stocks would be a good AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. But why worry that one will stumble? Just buy them up all at once with VanEck Semi. It has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.43% and has generated returns this year exceeding 48%. A $1,000 investment three years ago would be worth over $2,060 today, and would have been achieved at lower risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "News nonprofit sues ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Microsoft for 'exploitative' copyright infringement",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Center for Investigative Reporting said Thursday it has sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its closest business partner, Microsoft, marking a new front in the legal battle between news publications fighting against unauthorized use of their content on artificial intelligence platforms.\n\nThe nonprofit, which produces Mother Jones and Reveal, said that OpenAI used its content without permission and without offering compensation, violating copyrights on the organization\u2019s journalism. The lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, focuses on how AI-generated summaries of articles threaten publishers \u2014 a move CIR called exploitative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s immensely dangerous,\u201d Monika Bauerlein, the nonprofit's CEO, told The Associated Press. \u201cOur existence relies on users finding our work valuable and deciding to support it.\"\n\nBauerlein said that \u201cwhen people can no longer develop that relationship with our work, when they no longer encounter Mother Jones or Reveal, then their relationship is with the AI tool.\u201d\n\nThat, she said, could \u201ccut the entire foundation of our existence as an independent newsroom out from under us\" while also threatening the future of other news organizations.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest against OpenAI and Microsoft to land at Manhattan\u2019s federal court, where the companies are already battling a series of other copyright lawsuits from The New York Times, other media outlets and bestselling authors such as John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin. The companies also face a separate case in San Francisco\u2019s federal court brought by authors including comedian Sarah Silverman.\n\nSome news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The latest to do so is Time, which announced Thursday that OpenAI will get access to its \u201cextensive archives from the last 101 years.\u201d\n\nOpenAI and other major AI developers don\u2019t disclose their data sources but have argued that taking troves of publicly accessible online text, images and other media to train their AI systems is protected by the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine of American copyright law.\n\nLast summer, more than 4,000 writers signed a letter to the CEOs of OpenAI and other tech companies accusing them of exploitative practices in building chatbots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a free resource for these AI companies to ingest and make money on,\u201d Bauerlein said of news media. \u201cThey pay for office space, they pay for electricity, they pay salaries for their workers. Why would the content that they ingest be the only thing that they don\u2019t (pay for)?\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AP is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI; others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times.\n\nMother Jones and CIR were both founded in the 1970s and merged earlier this year. Both are based in San Francisco, as is OpenAI.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Hardware Stocks to Buy for the Artificial Intelligence Era",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that the hardware industry stands to gain a lot from the boom in artificial intelligence. After all, it is the continued growth of the tech hardware industry that makes developments, such as\u00a0AI, more available to the public.\n\nThe global computer hardware market is expected to grow to $914.55 billion by 2028 at a 6.5% CAGR. While this growth comes from a myriad of factors, one of the more notable ones include the expansion of data centers.\n\nAll of the cloud service\u00a0industry leaders, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have announced expansions of data centers for the \u201cstorage and processing needs\u201d in hosting AI applications. Here are three hardware stocks for AI that I have identified as excellent picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSeagate (STX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a data storage company that broadly covers the data storage industry. The company\u2019s focuses include cloud storage systems and services, hard drives and solid state drives. Yahoo! Finance has 27 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on STX to be between $55.00 and $119.00, with a mean of $99.60.\n\nSTX did not show strong revenue, but profitability for the company has greatly improved. While revenue suffered a year-on-year loss, net profit margin has increased 106.49% YOY. Evidently, the company\u2019s improvement in profitability is characterized in its 941.13% YOY growth in free cash flow. STX even shows signs of being undervalued with a -11.45 price to book ratio, well below the sector median.\n\nSTX is a great buy beyond the financials. Seagate has partnered itself with Ebay to expand its Hard Drive Singularity Program. By selling refurbished and recertified hard drives on Ebay, this program improves Seagate revenue while also promoting sustainability. Seagate has also launched a new hard drive platform: the Mozaic 3+. The 30 terabyte Mosaic 3+ Exos hard drive has the same carbon footprint as a standard 16 terabyte hard drive, maximizing efficiency and furthering sustainability efforts. STX is one of the hardware stocks for AI that investors have to add to their portfolios.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a computer networking company that develops and manufactures components for large data centers and high-performance computing. Yahoo! Finance reports 25 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on ANET between $220.00 and $389.00, with a mean of $323.77.\n\nANET has shown very strong financials for Q1 2024. The company\u2019s profitability has shown great improvement, as earnings per share is up 39.16% YOY. Revenue has shown excellent growth, as seen through a 46.1% YOY net income increase. Management has done an excellent job at increasing revenue while maintaining profitability, with revenue growth being more than double operating expenses growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista has partnered with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an AI data center with lowered job completion times. Specifically, this network will streamline the use of generative AI applications for clients, saving clients\u2019 time and growing ANET\u2019s revenue by being the first choice in AI data centers. Arista has also introduced Universal Network Observability (UNO) on its operational tasks platform CloudVision. UNO improves troubleshooting abilities for clients through AI-driven analysis and recommendations for network issues. ANET is one of the hardware stocks for AI for me because of its advancements and new services that emphasize improving client experiences.\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California. PSTG stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nPure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) is a data storage platform that aims to simplify IT and offer data security to its clients. The company has approximately 60% of the Fortune 500 as clients. Yahoo! Finance reports 19 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on ANET between $44.00 and $80.00, with a mean of $70.51.\n\nPSTG boasts strong financials for Q1 2024. The company beat revenue and earnings expectations for Q1 2024, having demonstrated impressive jumps in both revenue and profitability. Revenue grew 17.68% YOY and EPS grew a whopping 300% YOY. This profitability growth is even more impressive when seeing the balance sheet, as management has made sure that asset growth has more than doubled\u00a0liability growth YOY.\n\nPure Storage has made an investment in Landing AI, a visual AI solutions company innovating in the space of Large Visual Models. Additionally, Landing AI develops AI tools that analyze visual data. This aligns closely with PSTG\u2019s goal as a data storage platform, and the companies will share common interests. Pure Storage has enhanced its cybersecurity offerings with improved ransomware recover and AI-based anomaly detection. These innovations specifically boost data security. For instance, the anomaly detection analyzing historical data of client\u2019s anomaly patterns to identify threats faster. PSTG is one of the hardware stocks for AI for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks on the Edge of a Massive Surge",
        "content": "Last week, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) briefly eclipsed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable company. The AI chip maker is now worth $3.3 trillion\u2026 or roughly the combined value of every residential property in the state of Florida. Shares trade for 50 times forward earnings.\n\nThat\u2019s caused expected hand-wringing on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily at peak bubble levels,\u201d said Jonathan Stubbs of Berenberg, a wealth management firm, \u201cbut there\u2019s definitely a whiff of bubble about it.\u201d Even some InvestorPlace.com writers are getting nervous about high valuations and urging readers to protect their gains by cashing out.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHistory, however, tells us that we\u2019re only getting started.\n\n\u201cAmerican shares could get pricier still,\u201d The Economist notes. \u201cPricey shares can always get pricier if investors keep bidding them up\u2026 It would probably be closer to the truth to say that just now, for whatever reason, investors seem willing to buy whichever narrative paints the rosiest picture.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s particularly good news for second-wave AI companies \u2014 those riding the coattails of Nvidia\u2019s graphics processing unit (GPU) innovations. These are the firms that benefit as AI technologies become more widespread. And they\u2019re the focus of the writers at InvestorPlace.com \u2014 our free news and analysis site \u2014 this week.\n\nThis week, our writers make the case that Nvidia\u2019s meteoric rise is now spawning a whole new cohort of AI winners. Here are their Top three picks for AI stocks on the edge of a massive surge\u2026\n\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX)\n\nDrug development has long been a slow, expensive process. Thousands of candidates are discarded in preclinical trials, and even the most promising ones generally fail. Only 3.4% of all cancer-related drugs make it from Phase 1 human trials to final U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, according to a study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers.\n\nIt\u2019s like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks\u2026 at a far costlier scale. Analysts expect the pharmaceutical industry to spend $260 billion this year on research and development.\n\nBut what if you could automate that process? What if AI-powered computers become able to model the human body and test how thousands of drug candidates will work?\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:RXRX) seeks to do. As Ian Cooper notes this week at InvestorPlace.com, the Utah-based firm is pioneering a platform that uses machine learning to identify new drugs at scale:\n\nStory continues\n\nAt $9.30, Recursion Pharmaceuticals holds immense potential. With a $50 million investment from Nvidia, the two are working on drug discovery driven by AI.\n\nHowever, with AI the rate of failure could drop, which is where Recursion Pharmaceuticals comes into play.\n\n\u201cTo find the drug and get it into the clinic, I think we can shorten that from five or six years and hundreds of millions of dollars into, perhaps, one or two years and just $10 million or $20 million,\u201d Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chris Gibson says.\n\nThe rise of better computing power (thanks to Nvidia\u2019s latest chips) will enable Recursion to do even more. Last month, the company announced it had completed construction of the Nvidia-powered BioHive-2, the fastest supercomputer in the pharma industry. Such processing speeds will allow digital experiments that previously would have required several months to be performed in parallel in far shorter time frames. And as AI processing power increases, so too should Recursion\u2019s chances for finding the next blockbuster drug.\n\nStem (STEM)\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly been a difficult year for Stem (NYSE:STEM), a company that\u2019s seen shares drop 70% since January. The solar industry has struggled with the phase-out of California\u2019s NEM 2.0 tax breaks, and Stem\u2019s focus on solar monitoring has left it exposed to the slowdown. During the first quarter, management was forced to reduce recorded revenues by $33 million to account for cuts in contract value estimates. First-quarter bookings collapsed to $23.8 million from $636.5 million a year earlier.\n\nHowever, the selloff now leaves Stem as an incredibly underpriced bet on AI technologies. As Jeremy Flint explains this week at InvestorPlace.com:\n\nStem\u2019s Athena software is an advanced control system that optimizes the interaction between generators, grid power, renewable energy sources like solar farms and battery storage. An artificial intelligence framework drives the system; Athena autonomously optimizes energy distribution based on variables like weather conditions and energy pricing, making it a pivotal tool for large-scale enterprise clients in managing their sustainable energy resources\u2026\n\nStem harbors ambitious growth plans that set it apart amid stocks to 20X. The company\u2019s vision, detailed in its \u201cAI and the Future of Energy\u201d white paper, showcases a strategic roadmap for leveraging AI to drive efficiency and advancement across the sustainable energy landscape.\n\nThe company also retains an enormous $1.6 billion contract backlog, up 33% from the prior year. Analysts expect the firm to break even on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) basis for the first time ever this year.\n\nThe success of Nvidia and AI optimism now makes STEM a stock that could rise 20X in the next decade, as Flint notes. The company\u2019s low share price values its equity at just $180 million \u2013 a small fraction of its current backlog. And analysts expect strong growth ahead as solar and other clean-energy networks come online. Revenues at Stem are projected to rise almost 30% annually through 2026.\n\nSoFi (SOFI)\n\nFinally, a recent 10% selloff in the past month now puts online banking firm SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) in prime buying territory. Shares trade at $6 \u2013 barely above book value.\n\nThomas Niel now advises InvestorPlace.com readers to buy SoFi\u2019s stock before it sizzles off the market\u2019s back burner:\n\nWall Street and Main Street investors remain \u201con the fence\u201d at best, bearish at worst, about the fintech firm and neobank. Burned by past price declines, retail traders have ceased to be excited about SOFI. That\u2019s clear, from the fact that shares barely budged during last month\u2019s short-lived \u201cmeme wave.\u201d\n\nYet while SOFI still hasn\u2019t become a hot stock once again, a resurgence in popularity could still arrive relatively soon. At least, when you consider the next big event for the company and for the stock is just a little over a month away\u2026\n\nThe event Niel refers to is, of course, SoFi\u2019s earnings. Analysts expect the company to notch a 16% increase in revenues and flip from negative $0.05 earnings per share to positive $0.01. The company has been riding a wave of higher interest rates, which raises net interest income.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that SoFi is one of the leaders of AI use in retail banking. The firm was an early adopter of AI chatbots for financial advisory. And InvestorPlace.com\u2019s Muslim Farooque notes that SoFi also employs the technology heavily in its underwriting business \u2013 something that has helped firms like Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) stay ahead in insurance underwriting.\n\nThat suggests SoFi could produce even better figures than expected. Markets have long worried about the quality of the online bank\u2019s loan portfolio, given the firm\u2019s relatively young age and lack of lending history. But lower loan losses (thanks to advancements in AI-assisted lending) could quickly flip the needle on this stock again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Insanely Cheap Stocks Set to Benefit From AI Tailwinds in 2024",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a tangible reality permeating nearly every facet of our lives. As we move further into 2024, cheap AI stocks to buy present a multitude of opportunities for investors.\n\nWhile tech giants leading the AI revolution like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominate the headlines, their lofty valuations can be increasingly problematic. This has led to many Wall Street analysts cutting their price targets on these giants. Furthermore, forward price-to-earnings ratios in the sector look extremely stretched, with many of the stocks trading in overbought territory. With AI applications being extremely vast, many hidden gems are well-positioned to benefit from AI tailwinds.\n\nTherefore, astute investors will be more inclined to consider these companies than buy expensive AI giants at a potential top.\u00a0Now, let\u2019s discover the top 3 cheap AI stocks to buy to benefit from AI tailwinds in 2024 and beyond!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP)\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a well-established player in the human capital management sector (HCM). As the sector rapidly embraces automation, AI will be pivotal to ADP\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nADP remains ahead of the curve when it comes to the implementation of generative AI and machine learning principles for business. Its generative AI platform, ADP Assist, offers robust AI capabilities from the industry\u2019s largest HCM dataset. It can validate payroll information, detect fraud, offer insights, and answer questions about all aspects of the HCM experience. This will be extremely beneficial to its more than 1 million paying customers and further strengthen its already high retention rates.\n\nIn its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 7% year over year to $5.3 billion. Net earnings rose 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, or $2.88 per share. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 140 basis points to $29.3%, driven by healthy new business bookings. With a forward price to earnings of 25, ADP is one of the best cheap AI stocks to keep on your radar in 2024.\n\nGodaddy (GDDY)\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a global leader in web hosting and domain registration. The company has been leveraging AI to enhance its customer experience and streamline operations. Its extensive use of AI spans from personalized customer support to sophisticated marketing tools for small and midsize enterprises (SMEs).\n\nAI plays a crucial role in Godaddy\u2019s operations. The company\u2019s new Airo platform provides an unparalleled customer experience providing its customers with a full suite of AI tools. Some of its features include AI-generated logo creation, social media ad creation, email marketing, and more. In FY23, Godaddy delivered extremely impressive earnings results as management continued to execute on strategic priorities. Net earnings skyrocketed nearly 295% year over year to $1.4 billion, with free cash flow surpassing $1 billion for the first time.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts diverse platform offerings also contributed to notable EBITDA margin expansion. Additionally, the company recently joined the S&P 500 on June 21st. This is an extremely positive tailwind as major funds, ETFs, and institutions will be forced to buy up the stock. Godaddy offers a significant growth potential with a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio, making it one of the top cheap AI stocks to buy now.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a giant in the semiconductor industry, is undoubtedly one of the best cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. Known for its Snapdragon processors, Qualcomm\u2019s chips power a wide range of devices, from smartphones to laptops, and IoT devices.\n\nThe increasing demand for artificial intelligence has provided a significant boost to the semiconductor industry in 2024. Led by AI GPU giants such as Nvidia, the market has soared to unprecedented heights. This has many investors questioning its valuation and highlighting the potential untapped value of companies like Qualcomm. In its latest quarterly financial results, the company reported strong earnings at the high end of its guidance.\n\nNet earnings increased 37% year over year to $2.33 billion, driven by strong performance in its automotive platform. The company\u2019s Snapdragon X platforms continue to gain traction, including its recent blockbuster deal to supply AI chips for Microsoft\u2019s Surface PCs. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18, Qualcomm represents a compelling opportunity among cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe major indexes may have only chalked small gains Wednesday, but while the generals were sleeping, the soldiers were on the march.\n\nAt the vanguard, moderate losses in large-cap energy and financials were offset by outsized gains in the consumer discretionary sector \u2014 thanks principally to Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThis seesaw theme has become a subtle but important market narrative. On days when AI isn't leading the charge, select pockets of strength keep the S&P 500 from more pronounced sell-offs \u2014 which itself is holding index volatility near multiyear lows.\n\nThe recent \"plunge\" in Nvidia is instructive.\n\nOnly Monday, the AI poster child closed down 13% from its record high. Surveying social media, you would think Wall Street was burning.\n\nBut during that harrowing three-day slump, a funny thing happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) \u2014 up only 3% this year versus 14% for the S&P 500 \u2014 staged a comeback. Energy perked up, and biotech jumped as forgotten pockets of the market showed signs of life.\n\nThis seesaw-offsetting behavior is everywhere right now in lieu of correlations between even stocks in similar sectors. Stocks simply do not want to move in the same direction.\n\n\"This is a generationally weird US stock market,\" wrote Luke Kawa, a former director of investment solutions at UBS Asset Management Americas now at Sherwood Media.\n\nKawa was specifically referencing Tuesday's price action, in which the S&P 500 managed a 0.4% gain despite 384 of its components closing in the red \u2014 a new feat for a data set that goes back to 1996.\n\nSimilar \"firsts\" have been dotting the market statistics recently.\n\nBut none of this detracts from the argument \u2014 supported by ample research and history \u2014 that it's perfectly normal in a bull market to have gains concentrated in a few stocks.\n\nWinning stocks that enjoy a secular-themed rally get bigger and bigger until the move runs its course.\n\nIn a bull market, when leading stocks falter, other parts of the market that may not be generating hype-filled headlines can rise to the occasion. Sector rotation keeps volatility at the index level low as new winners offset losers. And then, at some point, the music stops and all sectors start selling off in unison, kicking off a new bear market.\n\nKawa tied this to the current market, writing that \"different major groups within the US stock market have been marching to the beat of their own drummers recently, and this dynamic has helped keep the stock market from lurching violently to the downside.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWe're not only currently seeing disparate returns among sectors and industries, but also inside them \u2014 even in the megacap tech stocks. In the past six months, if some of them, say Microsoft and Alphabet, are up, Nvidia and Apple might be down. The correlation between directional moves between pairs in this cohort is a scant 43%, Kawa noted.\n\nAll of this zigging and zagging keeps index-level volatility at bay, but Kawa lays out the major risk in this environment: a \"correlated shock\" that is distributed \"among these companies that control so much of US as well as global equity indices.\"\n\nThough the \"big drop\" remains the focal risk, divergences can persist longer than arbitrage investors can remain solvent (to turn an old Wall Street trope).\n\nIn fact, research by the data analytics team at BofA suggests that the current regime of low inter- and intra-sector correlation can persist for years. Stock correlations within the S&P 500 are at historic lows.\n\n\"Multiple years of decorrelation in the 90s as the internet bubble developed suggests that persistence of today's regime remains a risk,\" wrote BofA.\n\nAccordingly, the outsized bifurcation in returns between the chosen AI few and the rest of the market needn't end with a bang.\n\n\"Just because we\u2019re in uncharted waters doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re heading for a waterfall. It could end up being a lazy river,\" wrote Kawa. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Finding potential trillion-dollar companies is a calculated risk that may significantly improve an investor\u2019s portfolio. The encouraging development paths of three businesses are on track to accomplish this goal. Investors hoping to profit from rising market leaders must comprehend the principles underlying these businesses\u2019 success. These businesses excel in cloud services, are leaders in semiconductor technology and have creative methods to integrate AI. These accomplishments underscore the strategic ambitions driving these businesses.\n\nHere is a thorough review of these firms\u2019 fundamentals, including their financial stability and strategic initiatives. The analysis explores why they are strong candidates for trillion-dollar values in the future. With an emphasis on identifying critical growth drivers and market positioning in pursuing future trillion-dollar stocks, the insights provided here\u00a0are intended\u00a0to provide readers with the knowledge necessary to make wise investment decisions. These businesses can be valued at trillions of dollars as they represent the tech industry\u2019s dynamic character and high potential for financial gain.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The logo for Oracle Corp (ORCL) is seen on the side of a tall glass building.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) offers enterprise software and cloud services. In Q4 fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s financials point to strong growth potential. This is\u00a0especially\u00a0derived from its cloud services business. Oracle saw a considerable boost in cloud revenue in Q4 with total cloud revenue up 20% to $5.3 billion.\u00a0Indeed, solid leads in the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) sectors led to this expansion. Notably, IaaS sales increased by 42% to $2 billion. Meanwhile, SaaS revenue increased by 10% to $3.3 billion, which\u00a0reflects Oracle\u2019s successful execution in meeting market demand for its cloud products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, despite the overall sales increase, the company\u2019s cloud services and licensing support division had a 77% gross margin. It is a positive trend towards higher-margin cloud services. In Q4, non-GAAP operating income increased to $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year\u2019s period. Additionally, the operating margin increased from 47% to 44%. This enhancement demonstrates Oracle\u2019s capacity to develop its business effectively even as cloud revenues rise.\n\nTo conclude, Oracle\u2019s significant growth in cloud revenue highlights its robust positioning among future trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nASML Holdings (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) is an edge semiconductor manufacturing technology. The business\u2019s strong backlog and order book further support its upward trajectory. Net system bookings in Q1 2024 were 3.6 billion euros, with the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system accounting for a sizable portion of those bookings at 656 million euros. The sustained demand demonstrates trust in ASML\u2019s technological plan and tactical placement in the semiconductor supply chain. By the end of Q1 2024, ASML had over 38 billion euro in backlog.\u00a0This\u00a0gives it significant insight into future sales and a robust platform for continued top-line growth.\n\nAdditionally, the business planned to invest around\u00a01.7 billion euro in Q2 2024, having committed 1.32 billion euro to research in Q1 2024. The primary goal of these expenditures is the development of EUV technology. Furthermore, ASML is positioned favorably for future growth cycles because of its proactive capacity ramp-up and strategic material intake.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0highlights the company\u2019s ability to satisfy rising demand as global fabs develop.\n\nOverall, with a\u00a0strong backlog and substantial investments in research, ASML may hit increasing global demand and maintain its presence on the future trillion-dollar stocks list.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) leads in the semiconductor industry. AMD derived strong sales growth in the client division, up 85% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Strong demand for its Ryzen 8000 series CPUs was the main factor driving this growth. In particular, AMD\u2019s Ryzen Pro 8000 processors, meant for use in commercial PCs, have garnered positive feedback due to their embedded AI accelerators.\n\nFurther, strategic alliances with top original equipment manufacturers have made it easier to introduce new products and get people to use\u00a0AMD-powered devices. AMD\u2019s focus on meeting the need for AI-driven computing solutions\u00a0is reflected\u00a0in its partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and more than 150 independent software suppliers (ISVs) creating software for AMD AI PCs. Thus, AMD may use AI\u2019s adoption prospects across the PC ecosystem to increase its revenue share as the industry prepares for a possible growth cycle in 2024.\n\nTo sum up, AMD\u2019s focus on integrating AI capabilities into its Ryzen processors and strategic partnerships make it a prime candidate among future trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in ASML and AMD.

        "content": "Cloud computing is one of the industries gaining much traction in 2024.

        "content": "Four years and three CEOs after Slack first lashed out at Microsoft over its generous Teams and Office package, the company\u2019s newest boss is cheering what could be a multibillion-dollar judgment against its rival.\n\nSpeaking to Fortune, Slack CEO Denise Dresser welcomed the EU\u2019s latest intensification in its war with big tech after the bloc leveled competition charges that appeared to be hurting Slack.\n\nThe EU raised antitrust concerns with Microsoft on Tuesday for bundling its Teams and Office packages, which competitors including Slack argue give it an illegal advantage. The EU said Microsoft\u2019s actions were \u201cpossibly abusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president in charge of competition policy at the EU.\n\nSlack, owned by Salesforce since 2021, first brought its complaint against Microsoft in 2020. But swirling momentum against the biggest names in tech means these complaints are now materializing into action.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by their statement of objection and certainly are supportive of anything that encourages free and fare competition in the marketplace,\u201d Dresser told Fortune.\n\nIn April, Microsoft said it would stop bundling Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, after scrapping it in the EU last year.\n\nMicrosoft could be fined up to 10% of its annual revenue, equivalent to $21 billion, if found guilty.\n\nIn a later statement to Fortune, Salesforce\u2019s president and chief legal officer Sabastian Niles said: \u201cThe Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft\u2019s practices with Teams have harmed competition.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the Commission\u2019s thorough investigation of Slack's complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.\u201d\n\nA representative for Microsoft told Fortune: \"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\"\n\nFor Dresser, the news that the EU appears likely to take action against Microsoft will be a further boost as she steadies the Slack ship after a series of high-profile departures.\n\nDresser became the workplace messaging group\u2019s third CEO within 10 months last year after Lidiane Jones\u2019s surprise exit to the dating app Bumble.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is plotting its big AI play, pointing out that Slack AI already saves users 97 minutes per week.\n\nThe EU is strengthening its rhetoric and actions against big tech\u2019s stranglehold on European industry.\n\nThe bloc fined Apple \u20ac1.8 billion ($1.95 billion) earlier this year over allegations it shut out music streaming competitors, most notably Spotify, which brought the complaint.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft said it would continue to allow customers in Hong Kong to use OpenAI's artificial intelligence (AI) models through its Azure cloud computing platform, after the start-up announced it was moving to restrict access to its services from unsupported regions such as mainland China and Hong Kong.\n\n\"There has been no change to our Azure OpenAI service offerings in Hong Kong,\" Microsoft's local office said in a statement to the South China Morning Post on Thursday. \"We continue to provide access to eligible customers in Hong Kong, via models deployed in regions outside Hong Kong.\"\n\n\"As an independent company, OpenAI makes its own decisions,\" Microsoft added.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nOpenAI, which counts Microsoft as its biggest investor, earlier this week sent a notice to developers in \"unsupported countries and territories\", which include mainland China and Hong Kong. The firm said it would take \"additional measures\" to block attempts from those regions to access its AI models via application programming interfaces (APIs), starting July 9.\n\nAn API is software that allows two computer programs to communicate with each other.\n\nOpenAI's services, which have been introduced in over 188 countries and regions, are officially unavailable in mainland China and Hong Kong, where users often access popular models such as ChatGPT through virtual private networks or third-party apps, while developers turn to proxies and outbound servers to bypass restrictions.\n\nThe San Francisco-based start-up did not elaborate on the reasons behind its latest move, which comes as the US government is ramping up efforts to cut off China's access to advanced AI technology, citing national security concerns.\n\nBesides sweeping export curbs on advanced chips, Washington is also looking into ways to limit China's use of computing power offered by US cloud providers to train AI models and support related applications.\n\nMicrosoft launched enterprise support for OpenAI models in Hong Kong in March last year, allowing developers to apply for access to a range of systems including GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, Codex and DALL-E 2.\n\nOn the mainland, authorities have approved 117 home-grown large language models - the technology behind ChatGPT and other generative AI services - for public release. Industry insiders and analysts have said OpenAI's service ban on China-based developers is set to push users towards domestic platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeijing-based Zhipu AI, considered one of the country's top OpenAI alternatives, announced a \"special house-moving plan\" to help China-based OpenAI users \"easily switch to home-grown [LLMs]\", according to a post published on its WeChat account.\n\nOther start-ups such as Baichuan and 01.ai, as well as Big Tech companies like Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu, are also dangling perks ranging from steep discounts to freebies to draw developers affected by OpenAI's new measures.\n\nAlibaba owns the Post.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the number one company in terms of market valuation and it can now become \u201cnumber on-er,\u201d Truist Securities analysts said in a Wednesday note.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market cap climbed to $3.34 trillion, overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world\u2019s most valuable public company. However, the chipmaker\u2019s shares then fell in several consecutive sessions, losing the top position.\n\n\u201cWe considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA's #1 market cap position,\u201d Truist analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, the firm said its comprehensive analysis of the data indicates \u201cthat becoming the largest company by market cap does not appear to systematically challenge future investment returns.\u201d\n\nTruist evaluated the investment returns and valuations of stocks that have achieved the largest market capitalization over the past 26 years. These stocks include Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe analysis revealed that most of these stocks underperformed relative to the S&P 500 index over short-term periods of one week, one month, and three months following their initial ascent to the top market cap position. However, in the longer term, the stocks generally outperformed the S&P 500 over one-year, three-year, and five-year periods, the investment bank noted.\n\nOverall, analysts continue to view NVDA as the top choice for investing in the AI theme. Citing recent feedback from industry contacts, including component buyers and sellers, they note that there is ongoing and broadening demand for Nvidia's GPU systems. While Blackwell systems are particularly favored, Hopper systems are also being well received.\n\nWithin this, the investment bank raised its price target on NVDA shares from $128 to $140.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTruist raises Nvidia stock target: 'Number one can become number one-er'\n\nRivian investors to seek details on path to profits at investor day\n\nHedge funds 'aggressively' sold tech stocks in June - Goldman Sachs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "FDVV: A Dividend ETF Where Nvidia Is the Top Holding?",
        "content": "You might be surprised to hear that a surging but low-yielding growth stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top holding for a dividend-focused ETF, but that\u2019s exactly the position it occupies in the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Just because Nvidia and other stocks like it feature a low yield doesn\u2019t mean that dividend funds should automatically count it out, and FDVV is a good example of why, as we\u2019ll discuss in this article.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on this $2.9 billion ETF from Fidelity based on its portfolio, which consists of an attractive combination of \u201cnew-school\u201d dividend stocks like Nvidia with \u201cold-school\u201d dividend stalwarts like Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). The ETF also boasts a strong performance track record in recent years, a 3.0% dividend yield, and reasonable fees.\n\nWhat Is the FDVV ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to Fidelity, FDVV invests in an index \u201cdesigned to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.\u201d\n\nNice Mix of Dividend Stocks\n\nFDVV offers decent diversification with 105 holdings, and its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 31.2% of assets.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of FDVV\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you\u2019ve surmised from the article\u2019s title, Nvidia is the ETF\u2019s top holding, with a weighting of 6.5%.\n\nAnd Nvidia isn\u2019t the only high-growth, lower-yielding dividend stock from the tech sector that is prominent in FDVV\u2019s top holdings. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are the fund\u2019s next three largest holdings.\n\nNvidia yields less than 0.1%, Microsoft and Apple feature yields below 1.0%, and Broadcom is only slightly higher, with a yield of 1.2%.\n\nYou might wonder what these low-yielding tech stocks are doing in a \u201chigh dividend\u201d ETF.\n\nFDVV\u2019s strategy is to invest in companies expected to continue paying and growing their dividends, not simply the dividend stocks with the highest yields. Growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom are expected to grow their earnings over time and thus have the capacity to increase their dividend payouts in the future, making them a good fit for dividend funds like FDVV.\n\nThis expected earnings growth also makes them more attractive investments than many dividend stocks that feature high yields but feature low or no growth and are essentially businesses in decline.\n\nFDVV is prudent to include these stocks as, despite their lower yields, they have generated exceptional total returns over time through a combination of price appreciation and dividends. For example, Broadcom has generated an exceptional total return of 2,907% over the past decade, while Nvidia has returned a stunning 26,839% over the same time frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be clear, past performance is no guarantee of future results. It\u2019s unlikely that these stocks will continue to rise at this pace in the years to come, but this illustrates why it\u2019s worth it for dividend investors (and funds) to include lower-yielding dividend-paying growth stocks within their strategies.\n\nFDVV does a good job of mixing lower-yielding, strong performers with higher-yielding, more traditional dividend stocks investors are accustomed to seeing in dividend ETFs. These include energy giants like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and consumer staples blue chips like Pepsi, Philip Morris, and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).\n\nFDVV\u2019s holdings collectively receive favorable ratings from TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Seven of FDVV\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and Broadcom, ExxonMobil, and Chevron feature \u201cPerfect 10\u201d ratings.\n\nFDVV itself features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nFDVV\u2019s Performance Has Been Solid\n\nThis combination of new-school growth stocks that pay dividends and old-school dividend stocks has generated solid returns over time.\u00a0As of May 31, FDVV has generated a strong 11.1% annualized return over the past three years and a solid 14.6% annualized return over the past five years.\n\nThis means that the dividend-focused FDVV has actually outperformed the broader market over the past three years, as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) has generated an annualized return of 9.6% over this time frame (as of May 31).\n\nHowever, FDVV has slightly lagged VOO over the past five years, as VOO has returned 15.8% annually over a five-year period.\n\nThat said, this is still an admirable five-year return, and FDVV investors can feel good about the total returns the fund has generated for them. An investor who put $100,000 into the fund five years ago would have $186,240 today.\n\nAbove-Average and Growing Dividend\n\nFDVV yields 3.0%, so its dividend yield is double that of the S&P 500. FDVV has been paying a dividend for seven years and has grown its dividend payout for the last three years in a row.\n\nModerate Fees\n\nFDVV charges a very reasonable expense ratio of just 0.15%. This means that the fund charges just $15 annually for every $10,000 invested. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this expense ratio, an investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $85 in fees over a five-year period.\n\nIs FDVV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FDVV earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 83 Buys, 22 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average FDVV stock price target of $52.32 implies 11.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nI\u2019m bullish on FDVV because I like the way the fund invests in both lower-yielding but high-performing dividend-paying growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom and more traditional, higher-yielding but lower-growth dividend stocks like ExxonMobil and Chevron. This sound strategy has led to attractive double-digit annualized returns over time.\n\nFurthermore, FDVV sports an above-average dividend yield of 3.0% and charges an expense ratio of 0.15%.\u00a0Adding it all up, FDVV looks like a sound choice for investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 50 Biggest Economies in the World by the End of 2024 and in this article we will look at the country that topped our rankings.\n\nA Brief Analysis of the World Economic Outlook\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the global economic outlook has improved since January. The global economy is now forecasted to grow at 2.7% during the year against the previous forecast of 2.4%. The improved economic outlook in Q2 of 2024 is mainly due to strong economic performance in the United States backed by a strong labor market delivering real income growth. Other major economies including the European Union and the United Kingdom are bringing down inflation without triggering a recession or increasing unemployment, and an improved economic prospect for large developing economies such as India and Brazil also fosters global growth.\n\nThe near-term economic prospects of major countries are diverse and the overall global economic projections are cautious due to higher interest rates, escalating geo-political risks, and worsening climate change risks. For instance, growth prospects for two of the largest economies in the world, the United States and China vary. While the economic growth in the United States continues to improve from 1.4% during the start of 2024 to 2.3% in June, growth in China is expected to moderate from 5.2% in 2023 to 4.8% in 2024, mainly due to the risks from the property sector of China and the pent up in consumer demand after the lifting of pandemic restrictions. However, the enhanced policy support by the government is forecasted to boost investment in infrastructure and strategic sectors in China. If you want to read more about the global economies you can also look at the\n\n24 Fastest Growing Economies in the World in 2024.\n\nCan AI be a Game Changer for the Global Economy\n\nAccording to International Data Corporation (IDC), the global AI software market was valued at $64 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 31.4% to reach $251 billion by 2027. Moreover, the global revenues for the AI market are projected to grow at a CAGR of 19% to reach $900 billion by 2026. According to the Bank of America, AI and Big Data have the potential to contribute approximately $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, whereas open data is forecasted to add around $3.2 trillion to $5.4 trillion in economic value to the global economy by increasing productivity, improving the healthcare, and reducing emissions.\n\nAI can boost the world economic outlook in three ways, firstly by increasing labor productivity by approximately 40% via automation, secondly, the problem-solving and self-learning ability of AI will increase its utility over time for economies and companies with high AI adoption rates. Lastly, it has the potential to drive public and private investments. According to McKinsey, funding for generative AI went up by 71.4% YoY in 2022. Moreover, the global private investment in AI increased by 48% in 2021 and amounted to $93.5 billion, almost double the total private investment when compared to 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeveloped economies including North America and China are forecasted to witness the biggest gains from AI. According to PwC, AI can enhance the GDP of China and the US by 26.1% and 14.5% by 2030, respectively, mainly due to their advanced technological infrastructure and consumer readiness for AI adoption.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company globally renowned for its support software, services, devices, and office productivity tools. The company through its Azure AI and cloud services is helping other companies including CallMiner, PwC, Accenture, TCS, and many more to build their own AI solutions thereby contributing to smooth AI adoption globally.\n\nThe company delivered a record third quarter, with revenue for the intelligent cloud segment increasing the highest by 21% to $26.7 billion. Growth in the segment was mainly driven by Azure and other cloud services contributing 24% and 31%, respectively. The strategic partnership of Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Open AI is orchestrating a new era of AI transformation. More than 65% of the fortune 500 companies now use the Azure Open AI Service.\n\nMicrosoft is introducing new AI technologies to support companies of all scales and sizes. On April 23, Microsoft introduced Phi-3, a set of small language models (SLMs) that are most capable, cost-effective, and outperforming same-size models in the market. Companies including LTIMindtree and PwC are already using Phi-3 to access third-party APIs including those from Meta, Cohere, and Mistral. On the other hand Azure Arc, a hybrid multi-cloud management system continues to grow and support organizations such as the World Bank to streamline their cloud migrations. Azure Arc customers grew twice year-on-year and now has approximately 33,000 customers.\n\nOverall Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) witnessed an 80% increase for $100 million plus Azure deals year-over-year, whereas the number of $10 million plus deals almost doubled during the same time. For instance, on June 3, Microsoft and Hitachi, a multinational conglomerate, signed a three-year, multibillion-dollar strategic partnership for creating innovative industry solutions. Under the agreement, Hitachi will integrate various services from Microsoft including Microsoft Cloud, Azure Open AI, and GitHub Copilot into its Lumada solutions to induce growth into its business and increase the productivity of 270,000 employees. The Biggest Economy in the World by the End of 2024\n\nA hand pointing from the United States to the global markets represnted in a map representing potential investment opportunities for U.S. investors.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo curate the list of the 50 biggest economies in the world by the end of 2024, we used GDP current prices in 2023 and GDP growth rates in 2024 sourced from the IMF. We used the GDP per capita figures for 2023 and the expected GDP growth rates for 2024 to calculate the estimated GDP for 2024 for each country. Next, we ranked the countries in ascending order of the GDP 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here)\n\nThe Biggest Economy in the World by the End of 2024\n\n1. United States\n\nGDP (2023): $27.36 trillion\n\nGDP Growth Rate (2024): 2.7%\n\nGDP (2024): $28.096 trillion\n\nThe United States of America is expected to be the biggest economy in the world by the end of 2024. America had a GDP of $27.36 trillion in 2023, which is forecasted to grow at 2.7% in 2024 to reach $28.096 trillion by the end of the year. The country continues to perform above expectations despite high interest rates, struggling economies around the globe, and a drawdown from excess savings. The government policies have been efficient in bringing inflation closer to the 2% target for 2024. The strong growth of the US economy is backed by increased consumer spending in both the first and second quarters of 2024, an improved labor market delivering real income growth, and stable business and government spending.\n\nCurious to learn about other economies that are going to grow at rapid rates?

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks With the Best Earnings Per Share in 2024",
        "content": "According to Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh, earnings growth drives stock prices over the long term. This assertion is evident as growth stocks with the best earnings per share (EPS) have led the market since it bottomed out in October 2022.\n\nTypically, you find best-in-class EPS growth in innovative companies riding the coattails of a secular trend. That\u2019s true for the growth stock picks on this list. These companies have invested heavily in their growth initiatives. Now, those efforts are bearing fruit and driving remarkable earnings growth.\n\nGiven the artificial intelligence (AI) buzz and growing capital expenditures by the hyperscalers, one major growth area has been data center AI chips. Another growth industry continues to be e-commerce. The shift from physical brick-and-mortar stores continues, driving e-commerce penetration worldwide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stocks with best EPS are profiting from the aforementioned trends. According to Finviz, they will grow their EPS by over 70% this year. Furthermore, analysts forecast over 25% earnings growth next year. These stocks aren\u2019t done yet, so expect more upside.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has capitalized on a once-in-a-generation innovation: the emergence of artificial intelligence. Over the years, the semiconductor chip company invested in designing powerful chips that could support accelerated computing. Now, it\u2019s reaping the rewards.\n\nNotably, the company has emerged as the undisputed leader in AI chips. Its AI chips are critical in training large language models as well as inference. Due to its technological advantage and lower total cost of ownership, its chips are in high demand. It counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as key customers.\n\nCapitalizing on demand, Nvidia revenues have soared over the past year. For instance, revenues for the fiscal year ending January 2024 grew 125%. As a result, GAAP diluted earnings per share surged an astounding 586%.\n\nAnalysts expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2025 after Q1 earnings highlighted the continued strength in demand. GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter rose 629% year-over-year (YOY), driven by Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and operating leverage.\n\nAs long as Nvidia continues to beat expectations, it will remain one of the growth stocks with best EPS. Wall Street consensus estimates call for over 109% growth in EPS for fiscal year 2025. Demand isn\u2019t slowing and Nvidia will continue marching higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) has been a real disruptor in the e-commerce market, taking share from incumbents. In China, it has been grabbing market share from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) by offering steep discounts and targeting lower-income consumers.\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s following the same playbook in developed markets. One good example is its approach in the U.S. It launched its shopping app Temu, which offers heavily discounted items. Then, it followed up with an aggressive marketing campaign with ads at the Super Bowl and across various social media sites.\n\nSince launching Temu, PDD has been in growth mode, blowing past analyst estimates. After growing revenues by 123% YOY in Q4 2023, growth accelerated to 131% YOY in Q1 2024. Even better, net income soared by 246%. These results reinforce why PDD stock is among the growth stocks with best EPS to buy today.\n\nWall Street analysts are also bullish and Goldman upgraded the stock to \u201cbuy,\u201d raising the price target from $145 to $184. Analysts Ronald Keung and David Ma increased their 2024 to 2026 profit estimates by 25% to 43% as they see sustained revenue momentum. Even looking at valuations, PDD is one of the top growth stocks with best EPS to buy today. Finviz estimates 77% EPS growth this year, yet PDD stock trades at 12 times forward EPS.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America is another stock riding the e-commerce wave to tremendous growth. Over the past five years, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has grown revenues at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57%. More growth lies ahead given the potential for increased penetration of e-commerce in Latin American markets.\n\nMELI is among the growth stocks with best EPS based on its growth profile. Over the past three years, EBIT has grown at a 109% CAGR. The forward outlook is even more attractive. According to Finviz, the e-commerce giant has grown trailing twelve-month EPS by 82% YOY. What\u2019s more, analysts expect EPS to increase by 77% this year and 35% in 2025.\n\nFundamentally, MercadoLibre is firing on all cylinders and can surpass these estimates. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter as total revenues increased from $3.18 billion to $4.33 billion, a 36% YOY growth rate. Key markets experienced strong growth, with Brazil and Mexico reporting 44% and 55%, respectively, after excluding reporting updates.\n\nLooking ahead, management sees secular opportunities for its e-commerce and fintech business. As more buyers shift online and customers seek simpler financial services, Latin America\u2019s e-commerce leader will soar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Bill Gates and Warren Buffett Team Up to Transform Nuclear Power",
        "content": "Bill Gates is ready to sink billions into getting next-generation nuclear energy off the ground in the United States. The world\u2019s sixth richest man has been a staunch nuclear supporter for years now, and has already sunk over a billion dollars of his own money into his innovative nuclear power start-up TerraPower LLC. But according to Gates, that cool billion is just the beginning. \u201cI put in over a billion, and I\u2019ll put in billions more,\u201d Gates was\u00a0recently quoted by Bloomberg.\n\nNuclear power has been\u00a0gaining traction around the globe as a viable option for national and private decarbonization strategies. Nuclear advocates argue that we can no longer afford to ignore nuclear\u2019s immense clean energy potential, as it is a proven technology with plenty of existing infrastructure, legal precedent and huge output capacity. While it is not considered to be a renewable energy, nuclear energy emits zero carbon emissions and could be a key part of a viable pathway to meeting global emissions targets.\n\nFinding new ways to drum up a whole lot of clean energy output in a hurry has become increasingly urgent as the tech sector, and\u00a0Artificial Intelligence in particular, suck up rapidly increasingly colossal amounts of energy. In fact, the increased demand from the tech sector has become so extreme that, for the first time in years, energy demand growth from the developed world has surpassed that of developing countries, flipping a long-running script on its head.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the entire IT industry is responsible for around 2 percent of global CO2 emissions,\u201d Science Alert reported in 2023. And that\u2019s just the beginning. Technological research and consulting firm Gartner\u00a0projects that without major industry and policy changes, the AI sector will be solely responsible for 3.5 percent of global electricity consumption as soon as 2030.\n\nAs a result, tech bigwigs are getting serious about finding new sources of carbon-free energy to power their companies\u2019 insatiable demand. And some of the biggest names in the biz are looking to nuclear to fill that need. Bill Gates\u2019 TerraPower, which he co-founded and co-funded with fellow multi-billionaire Warren Buffett (the two men have\u00a0estimated net worths of $140 billion and $103 billion, respectively), will likely directly supply nuclear energy to power Microsoft\u2019s own massive Artificial Intelligence ambitions. TerraPower aims to make nuclear safer and less controversial by piloting a new kind of reactor that uses liquid sodium as a coolant which allows them to significantly lower their water consumption and potentially even recycle their own spent nuclear fuel, closing a critical hazardous waste loop.\n\nStory continues\n\nA younger generation of tech whizzes with deep pockets are also showing a keen interest in nuclear energy as a potential saving grace for the runaway train that is AI\u2019s energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, best known as the makers of ChatGPT, has\u00a0publicly opined that nuclear energy will be critical to keeping AI\u2019s carbon footprint in check. Altman, too, has founded a start-up specializing in \u201cnuclear microreactors.\u201d Oklo, which is an AI-integrated nuclear energy firm, went public in May.\n\nAltman is also a heavy advocate for nuclear fusion research. \u201cThe AI systems of the future will need tremendous amounts of energy and this fission and fusion can help deliver them,\u201d Altman was\u00a0quoted in the Wall Street Journal last summer.\n\nNot only do some of the biggest names in Big Tech think that nuclear energy is the key to keeping the tech sector\u2019s carbon footprint in check, they also think that it could be a profitable venture, especially with some of the innovations that these disruptors are bringing to their new-age nuclear reactors. Historically, one of the biggest hurdles for nuclear power expansion has been the high construction costs of new plants. But\u00a0smaller and more standardized reactors could majorly cut down on those costs.\n\nBill Gates thinks that making nuclear power\u00a0 affordable and efficient is within reach, and he plans to keep putting the weight of his wealth behind it until it gets there. \u201cCoal is being outcompeted by natural gas,\u201d Gates told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cAnd so what we have to do is compete effectively with natural gas.\u201d\n\nBy Haley Zarenmba for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nExplaining the European Union\u2019s Leadership Shuffle The Top 7 Oil Companies by Proved Reserves Where Are Global Precious Metals Prices Heading?\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com\n\nView comments",

European regulators took a step closer to finding out, zeroing in on Apple and what they say are unfair restrictions in its App Store that stifle competition.\n\nThe heightened enforcement highlights Apple\u2019s strategic predicament.\n\nIn a world saturated by high-end hardware \u2014 where customers are increasingly reluctant to surrender to endless smartphone upgrades \u2014 Apple\u2019s services business has become more important to the company. But by leaning more heavily into App Store commissions and subscriptions, Apple draws more scrutiny to its \u201cwalled garden\u201d business approach.\n\nIn preliminary findings, regulators in Brussels contended that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 designed to address anticompetitive behavior. The EU alleges Apple illegally blocked software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the App Store. The charges are the first to be brought under the European law, giving Apple the unlucky designation of being the first US tech giant to come in its crosshairs.\n\nApple insists that it is in compliance with the law, pointing to changes it has made in recent months and the ability of developers to steer their users to the web to complete purchases. The company will have a chance to formally respond, and the EU will come to a final decision early next year. European regulators are also probing the business practices of Meta and Google to verify their compliance with the law.\n\nApple\u2019s charges in Europe come as legal troubles ratchet up at home. Apple faces antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general who have alleged that the iPhone maker wielded illegal monopoly tactics in the smartphone market.\n\nFrom Wall Street\u2019s point of view, the multiheaded threat seems far off. Apple has only just arrived to the AI party, and its bullish analysts see AI monetization as the next lucrative frontier.\n\nThe ultimate cost of regulatory compliance might mean a splintered tech landscape with more restrictive rules for some markets. But the Apple ecosystem remains unrivaled.\n\nAnd if AI-focused apps fall into place like the prior generation\u2019s, even a more competition-friendly form of gatekeeping will be enough to keep Apple on top.

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks to buy is an excellent starting point for investors seeking to establish their portfolios for lasting stability.\n\nBlue-chip stocks are particularly useful when market conditions are unstable since they offer a steady environment. These stocks are defensive and have the potential for healthy growth. This aspect is especially important given that inflation remains above the Federal Reserve\u2019s desired 2% level, thus making the economic environment even more challenging.\n\nMoreover, having sound financial health and past performance, they act as buffers to other investments in volatile markets. Additionally, the strategic dividends received by blue-chip stocks are also a major factor in their appeal.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese factors make them useful additions to any diversified investment portfolio, as they balance possible risks with high potential returns.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been on a roll lately, getting into some of the hottest segments, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This has led to its stock rising by 36% in the last year and a whopping 225% over the previous five years. TipRanks analysts are on board with this bullish trajectory, anticipating a further 11.85% upside for the stock. Microsoft has also consistently raised its dividend by an average of 10.60% annually over the past decade, signaling a strong commitment to shareholder value.\n\nFinancially, MSFT is backing up its hype. Its revenue shot up 17% year-over-year (YOY) in the third-quarter, and net income followed with a 20% increase. Additionally, with net profit margins hitting 35.5%, MSFT has perfected the art of growth and profitability.\n\nFurthermore, its Copilot initiative is equally impressive, with its Copilot for Security boosting its cybersecurity game big time. Plus, MSFT\u2019s collaboration with Nvidia on Azure for AI solutions drives significant revenue growth for the company and keeps it competitive in the cloud space.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V), a fintech trailblazer, has demonstrated consistent growth and stability. The company\u2019s stock has risen 21.1% YOY and 58.5% over the past five years. TipRanks analysts complement this growth and predict a 14.4% upswing. Additionally, Visa\u2019s record of 15 consecutive years of dividend hikes makes it a magnet for long-term investors.\n\nIn Q2 2024, the company\u2019s revenue and net income jumped by 10%, owing mostly to an increase in cross-border transaction volume. This performance led to an impressive 53.1% net profit margin, allowing Visa to distribute $3.8 billion back to its shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, highlighting its commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the company successfully adapts to the digital shift by integrating cryptocurrency into its payment system. Thus, it continues to be at the cutting edge of the rapidly developing financial technology by maintaining partnerships with various cryptocurrency companies.\n\nFor instance, Visa partnered with Transak earlier this year to bring a revolutionary service that allows customers in 145 countries to convert cryptocurrencies to their local currency instantly.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been an incredible success story lately, with its stronghold on AI and chip-making. This has led its stock price to skyrocket by 200% over the past year and over 3000% in past five years. Plus, NVDA has had a decent dividend growth rate of 10.31% over the past decade, proving it\u2019s in it for the long haul.\n\nThis growth has led NVDA to enjoy multiple catalysts. Recently, the company became a headline-grabber by executing a noteworthy 10-for-1 stock split. After the split, it even bumped up its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to one cent per share of common stock.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia\u2019s stock is flourishing because ETFs are rebalancing and adding more shares. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) is adding over $10 billion worth of Nvidia shares, giving the stock a solid boost.\n\nNvidia\u2019s financials are also a tour de force, with the company reporting a whopping 262.12% increase in revenue YOY. Additionally, Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip is spearheading a revolution in computing and driving more revenue.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office",
        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has been accused of breaching antitrust rules with the \u201cabusive\u201d bundling of its Teams and Office products by the European Union (EU) regulators.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary finding, EU officials stated that Microsoft has breached the bloc's competition rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites for businesses.\r\n\r\nThe potential consequences for Microsoft are significant, with the company facing a possible fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenues, a staggering amount of $211.9 billion in revenues reported for fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThe investigation, initiated nearly a year ago, stems from a 2020 complaint by Slack, now owned by Salesforce CRM. Slack alleged that Microsoft's practice of automatically including Teams with its Office software suite gave the communication tool an unfair advantage, stifling competition in the market for remote communication and collaboration tools.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission's preliminary findings suggest that Microsoft's practices may have restricted customer choice and hindered innovation. Specifically, the EU body is concerned that Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically bundling it with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites since at least April 2019. Furthermore, the Commission believes that interoperability limitations between Teams' competitors and Microsoft's offerings may have exacerbated the situation.\r\n\r\nIn response to earlier concerns, Microsoft had already taken steps to unbundle Teams from its productivity suites in Europe and globally. (Read More: Microsoft Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny)\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commission deemed these changes insufficient, stating that \"more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition.\" As the investigation proceeds, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how software suites are packaged and sold in Europe, potentially affecting millions of users and reshaping the competitive landscape in the business productivity software market.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nEU Intensifies Crackdown on Big Tech\n\nThis case highlights the EU's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology companies, with recent actions against Microsoft, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, highlighting the bloc's determination to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have gained 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 22.4%, 28.4% and 8.1%, respectively. These cases underscore the growing tension between the EU's regulatory ambitions and the business practices of dominant platform providers.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Apple finds itself grappling with multiple regulatory challenges in the EU. The company faces its first charges under the bloc's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. This action strikes at the heart of Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem and could have far-reaching implications for its business model.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also facing increased scrutiny from EU regulators. The company is under investigation for potentially non-compliant measures related to the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing. The European Commission has expressed concerns that Google's current practices may not treat third-party services fairly in search results, a core issue in the ongoing debate about the power of dominant search engines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the European Commission has launched a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces, including the company's controversial core technology fee for developers. In response to these regulatory pressures, AAPL has taken the drastic step of announcing the blockage of certain features, including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing, for EU users, citing security concerns related to DMA compliance.\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft, the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences. If found in violation of EU antitrust rules, the company not only faces potential financial penalties but may also be forced to make significant changes to its product strategy and distribution model in Europe.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will need to carefully navigate its product development and marketing strategies to align with evolving regulatory expectations, not just in Europe but potentially worldwide.

        "content": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple\n\nOn Monday,\u00a0EU\u00a0regulators found\u00a0that\u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL)\u00a0violated the Digital Markets Act\u00a0due to its\u00a0lucrative App Store by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\u00a0Regulators also revealed that they opened a separate investigation into Apple\u2019s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\u00a0Apple\u00a0responded that it is confident that the changes it made\u00a0in the EU comply with the DMA.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Apple is defending itself against antitrust charges\u00a0made by the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general.\u00a0In March, they sued Apple for using\u00a0illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe\u00a0new law designed to rein in tech giants\u00a0and limit their power is already starting to give Big Tech legal headaches.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act that went into effect in March aims to limit the monopoly power that\u00a0Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\u00a0Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT),\u00a0ByteDance,\u00a0and\u00a0Meta (NASDAQ: META)\u00a0enjoy by\u00a0imposing\u00a0more restrictive rules around competitive practices. Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by\u00a0blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly\u00a0raised\u00a0the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\u00a0As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for\u00a0abusing\u00a0its\u00a0market dominance in\u00a0the distribution of music streaming apps,\u00a0and is appealing the court\u2019s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple\u2019s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing\u00a0the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its\u00a0pay or consent\u201d model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers\u00a0and will question if Meta is\u00a0obtaining\u00a0consent from users when\u00a0intending\u00a0to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that\u00a0Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft\u00a0fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means business.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Enhanced Returns",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are regaining popularity in investment portfolios, a shift prompted by recent years of higher interest rates favoring fixed-income options over dividend yields. However, as investors return to dividend stocks, the criteria for evaluating these investments have evolved\u2014mirroring broader shifts in investment standards.\n\nToday\u2019s investors prioritize solid financial fundamentals, a stark contrast to the cheap debt era, when simple promises of future profits could draw substantial investment, often regardless of weak financial management. Now, with a more cautious approach, investors are steering clear of speculative stocks and seeking more robust financial backbones.\n\nThis heightened scrutiny is particularly relevant for dividend stocks. While investors demand stability from growth stocks, they also seek substantial long-term growth potential from their dividend-bearing investments. Despite short-term Treasuries offering yields above 5%, dividend stocks must offer higher yields or the potential for significant long-term capital gains\u2014or ideally both\u2014to distinguish themselves in a competitive landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) consistently ranks among the top dividend stocks to own indefinitely, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Known as a dividend aristocrat, Realty Income offers monthly distributions and a 5.8% yield, making it a perennial favorite among investors. After a nearly 20% decline over the past year, this dividend stock is now attractively priced for long-term investors. The company\u2019s core strengths remain unchanged, positioning it as a compounder for today\u2019s buyers.\n\nRealty Income maintains an impressive occupancy rate of over 98% across its properties, with the overwhelming majority of its retail tenants operating in sectors resilient to economic downturns. A substantial portion of these tenants are in the grocery sector, complemented by convenience stores, dollar stores, and drugstores, creating a diversified portfolio that is largely immune to economic volatility.\n\nThe company\u2019s triple-net lease model is particularly advantageous, as it transfers all operational risks and expenses, including property maintenance costs, to the tenants. This structure shields Realty Income from rising material and labor costs often associated with higher interest rates. Additionally, with leases typically spanning 15 years or more and including renewal options, Realty Income enjoys a reliable stream of rental income. The average lease term until renewal is a lengthy 9.8 years, providing the REIT with significant flexibility over the next decade, regardless of economic fluctuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada.

Moving beyond the seasonal nature of tax services, H&R Block is diversifying its revenue streams to ensure steady cash flow throughout the year.\n\nTo counter the cyclical nature of the tax sector, H&R Block launched a mobile banking service that has quickly gained traction. The company has secured $456 million in net customer deposits and 316,000 customer signups in less than two years, filling a significant market gap. Additionally, H&R Block is leveraging new technologies for more efficient tax filing, collaborating with industry giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on an OpenAI-powered tax assistance product.\n\nH&R Block\u2019s appeal as a dividend stock is further enhanced by its impressive 10.25% total yield, which includes a respectable 2.4% dividend yield and substantial stock buybacks. Supported by a modest 29% payout ratio, this yield indicates that H&R Block retains a considerable portion of its earnings for growth initiatives while still providing significant returns to its shareholders.\n\nVICI Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nDreaming of a Las Vegas getaway? Investing in VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) could be your next smart move. This dividend stock holds ownership and occasional operations of some of Vegas\u2019s most iconic locations, including Caesar\u2019s Palace, the Venetian, and MGM Grand. VICI\u2019s extensive portfolio positions it as a strong investment, given Vegas\u2019s enduring global popularity.\n\nThe company became publicly traded in 2017 after Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) went through bankruptcy. Unlike Caesars Entertainment, which still manages Caesars Palace, VICI owns the actual real estate, allowing it to benefit from tourist and gambler spending without bearing the operational risks of its tenants.\n\nSince its IPO, VICI has provided a solid 60% return, with gross returns surpassing 120% when factoring in distributions. Over the last seven years, VICI has consistently offered a dividend yield of around 5%, with the current trailing yield at 5.9%. This robust yield, paired with promising growth prospects, makes VICI an excellent choice for dividend-focused investors.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to value investing, few can rival Warren Buffett. One dividend stock he currently favors is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Offering a 2.9% total yield with a 21% payout ratio, OXY provides substantial advantages for both income and growth investors.\n\nBuffett has notably increased his investment in Occidental Petroleum over the past few years, particularly in 2023, ultimately acquiring a 27% stake in the oil and gas giant, valued at more than $14.5 billion. And, despite shares trading fairly flat, Buffett just keeps buying. Though Occidental\u2019s net-zero and sustainability-focused projects promise a future energy pivot, the company continues to benefit from rising crude oil prices currently seen in the market.\n\nIn recent months, Occidental\u2019s share price has ranged between $55 and $65. Thanks to its strengths and the surge in crude prices, Occidental Petroleum is nearing new five-year highs. Following Buffett\u2019s lead on this dividend stock could be a wise move, as it offers a unique growth opportunity in a well-established industry.\n\nEdison International (EIX) Southern California Edison sign and logo EIX stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUtility companies often attract dividend investors due to their stable customer base, reliable financials, and tendency to redistribute profits to shareholders. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stands out among these companies, especially as the company has strong growth potential that similarly mature utilities tend to lack.\n\nEdison International surpasses industry dividend averages by nearly 2% while consistently increasing its annual payout for the past 20 years. After hitting a low in October 2023, EIX\u2019s stock price rebounded significantly, growing 15% since then. However, the numbers only tell part of the story.\n\nOperating in California, Edison faces more stringent state regulatory challenges compared to its counterparts. But this could work to Edison\u2019s advantage.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s continued moves away from natural gas, despite questionable success thus far, and the rising demand for green energy practices in the state position Edison as one of the few utility firms with tangible growth prospects. While currently focused on southern California, the state\u2019s overall push for sustainability and carbon neutrality by 2045 suggests Edison has significant expansion potential.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a household name globally, yet investors often overlook its potential for dividend and income investing despite its continued growth potential, market power and 4.3% dividend yield.\n\nFrom a value investor\u2019s perspective, McDonald\u2019s is a mature and stable presence with an unrivaled market footprint. The company operates 38,000 locations in over 100 countries and offers investors geographic diversification, scaled operations, and a dependable cash flow. Its robust balance sheet and iconic brand provide a significant competitive edge, effectively deterring new market entrants. Additionally, McDonald\u2019s continues to embrace technological advancements and initiatives, focusing on digital and delivery capabilities, which positions it well for adapting to evolving consumer habits and potential future growth.\n\nFor income investors, McDonald\u2019s has a long and impressive history of paying and increasing dividends. It belongs to the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have raised dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Impressively, McDonald\u2019s has increased its dividend for nearly 50 consecutive years, demonstrating a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders. This consistent and growing income stream makes it an ideal choice for those seeking stability and reliability in their dividend stock portfolio.\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery.

SCHD grants access to leading dividend-producing companies, including core holdings like Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGEN), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Merk & Co (NYSE:MRK). Together, these and other top-tier dividend stocks yield an attractive 3.83% SEC yield.\n\nSCHD\u2019s foundation is built on the Dow Jones Dividend 100 index, which only includes stocks that have increased dividends for ten consecutive years and possess the financial strength to continue doing so. This index is a powerful diversification tool, offering a solid 6% return over the past five years with relatively low volatility.\n\nMorningstar analysts call SCHD \u201cone of the best dividend funds available,\u201d citing its inherently defensive nature as the top dividend stocks comprising the ETF \u201ctend to be more insulated from market movements.\u201d\n\nOftentimes, those adding dividend stocks to a well-rounded portfolio do so in an effort to diversify \u2014 and adding SCHD as a core dividend holding helps diversify your strategy even further.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Looking to dip your toes in blockchain? Here are some strong buy blockchain stocks that could pique your interest.\n\nBlockchain stocks are shares in companies that develop or use blockchain one way or another.\n\nBlockchain was introduced to the world by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 the creator(s) of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) \u2014 as the underlying technology of the cryptocurrency.\u00a0Today, more companies are lining up to adopt the tech for its ability to tamper-proof systems \u2014 among other game-changing use cases.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlockchain stocks are either pure plays or companies that focus exclusively on blockchain. They could also be companies that integrate blockchain into their processes or invest in the tech. For the latter companies, it\u2019s a classic case of \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat them, join them,\u201d as blockchain\u2019s relevance becomes more undeniable than ever.\n\nHere are our picks for some strong buy blockchain stocks this season.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) was included in Forbes\u2019 2023 Blockchain 50 list, a list of billion-dollar companies aggressively pursuing distributed ledger technology.\n\nFor Mastercard to push into blockchain this way is wholly ironic, given that the technology was conceived to power a money system that would wrest control from financial \u201cestablishment\u201d stalwarts such as the payments company.\n\nBut Mastercard\u2019s venture into blockchain is with the same motivations as its experimentation with artificial intelligence. The trains for these two phenomena have left the station, and financial companies that don\u2019t leap on risk lagging behind. Mastercard knows this.\n\nThe company has historically been a strong buy. That\u2019s thanks to a global shift towards cashless transactions, a massive cardholder and merchant network worldwide, and continuous innovation \u2014 such as with blockchain.\n\nWith its already strong fundamentals, plus its integration of the tech, Mastercard is a strong buy blockchain stock any time. Analysts agree. Out of 40, 30 rate Mastercard a \u201cbuy,\u201d six rate it \u201coverweight\u201d and four give it a \u201chold\u201d rating.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was one of the first big-time American corporations to prepare for the blockchain revolution.\n\nThe tech company\u2019s first foray into blockchain was in 2015 with its Microsoft Azure Blockchain as a Service (BaaS). The service is a partnership with blockchain company Consensys to offer developers a single-click, cloud-based environment.\n\nMicrosoft has gone on to expand its blockchain offerings over the years with projects such as the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) and its recent partnership with Axelar.\n\nStory continues\n\nCCF is an open-source tool that lets members perform secure and verifiable computations without needing to trust each other or a central authority. With the Axelar partnership, Microsoft seeks to create best-in-class blockchain onramps for startups and enterprises.\n\nMicrosoft would still be a successful company by any measure without blockchain. However, its onboarding of the tech has certainly helped it maintain a competitive edge, and it\u2019s a sure bet for strong buy blockchain stocks.\u00a0Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly rate Microsoft shares a \u201cbuy\u201d with 47 \u201cbuy\u201d ratings against eight \u201coverweight\u201d and just three \u201cneutral\u201d ratings.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you were ever to go by strong buy ratings alone, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) would be hands down a go-to stock right now. Analysts currently give the company a consensus rating of \u201cbuy,\u201d with all recommending buying the stock.\n\nRiot Platforms is one of several companies profiting from Bitcoin\u2019s rise. The Colorado-headquartered firm mines the pioneering crypto.\n\nRiot recorded $212 million in net income for Q1 this year \u2014 a 1,000% increase from a year ago and a record for the company. The firm profited from BTC\u2019s 131% surge to book $74.6 million in revenue.\n\nThe company will maintain a strong buy blockchain stock status for the foreseeable future. CoinTelegraph reported in April that Riot\u2019s stock price rose higher than other BTC mining outfits after it announced a new facility in Corsicana, Texas. Once complete, it will be the biggest BTC mining operation worldwide, per CEO Jason Les.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Finding promising businesses with room to develop significantly may be challenging but profitable in the fast-paced world of stock investments. These three equities are particularly attractive and might be profitable buys for investors looking to increase their holdings. In the present market environment, each firm is an attractive contender due to the distinct characteristics and strategic advantages they bring to the table. Determining which high-growth stocks to buy involves analyzing historical performance and projecting future growth potential and market trends.\n\nThese companies possess the essential elements. These include leading in automation solutions, growing their enterprise footprint through strategic alliances, utilizing cutting-edge AI technologies to navigate the dynamic changes in digital advertising, and utilizing industry-specific knowledge to propel revenue growth in various sectors.\n\nThese stocks have strong fundamentals and strategic efforts that support long-term wealth development goals for investors looking to grow $5,000 into $50,000 over the next two years. A thorough analysis of their financial standing, approach to the market and development trajectory perfor their industry should make it evident why these companies are strong picks in the present economic environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUiPath (PATH) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a leading robotic process automation (RPA) software provider. As of Q1 fiscal 2025, the firm had about 10,800 clients. Within that, 2,092 more clients are now delivering annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $100,000 or more. In contrast, there were 288 people with ARRs of $1 million or more. Further, 118% was the net retention rate calculated in dollars, demonstrating intense client satisfaction and account growth within current accounts. UiPath\u2019s ability to drive\u00a0greater\u00a0transaction volumes and penetrate deeper into business sectors is reflected in the growing number of high-value clients. Hence, the high retention rates are a sign of satisfied and loyal customers.\n\nAdditionally, for Q1, UiPath maintained a solid\u00a0operating margin of 15%. The non-GAAP-adjusted free cash flow was $101 million, which shows effective cash management even with expansion and product development project expenditures. Through strategic alliances with major market players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), UiPath expands its client base and broadens its market penetration.\n\nTo sum up, UiPath\u2019s inclusion on the high-growth stocks list\u00a0is based\u00a0on solid client growth, high retention rates, and strategic partnerships.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerion Network\u00a0(PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerionNetwork (NASDAQ:PERI) leads in digital advertising solutions. Notwithstanding the difficulties brought on by Microsoft Bing\u2019s modifications to its advertising pricing and methods, Perion announced a respectable 9% annual revenue growth to $157.8 million in Q1 2024. Strong results in other important categories somewhat mitigated the drop in video revenue. These include search advertising, connected TV (CTV) advertising, digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising and retail media solutions.\n\nAdditionally, one key component of Perion\u2019s plan to reduce risks related to changes in certain ad networks is the diversity of revenue sources. For example, search advertising income reached $82 million,\u00a0up 26% annually. This shows how resilient Perion is and how well its partnership model works despite the expected\u00a0adverse\u00a0effects of Microsoft\u2019s price changes.\n\nFurthermore, Perion\u2019s CTV advertising section grew extraordinarily, rising \u00a0108% to $8.2 million from the previous year. Strong client acceptance of high-impact CTV solutions is reflected in this expansion, which\u00a0puts Perion in a favorable position within the quickly growing digital advertising market.\n\nDespite challenges, Perion\u2019s resilience and strategic diversification into high-growth segments contribute to its appeal on the high-growth stocks list.\n\nRCM Technologies (RCMT) A photo of three people sitting around one end of a table, looking at a laptop screen.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff/ShutterStock.com\n\nRCM Technologies (NASDAQ:RCMT) operates in diversified sectors, including healthcare, education, life sciences, energy services and aerospace and defense. The company\u2019s sales during the first quarter of 2024\u00a0increased by 7.2% over the previous year to $71.9 million. The revenue increase was even more remarkable at around 12.8% after accounting for COVID-19 effects and strategic reductions.\u00a0This\u00a0demonstrates RCM Technologies\u2019 capacity to overcome obstacles and seize strategic opportunities.\n\nMoreover, the attention RCM Technologies approaches each sector is a fundamental component of the company\u2019s growth strategy. Industry-specific projects meant to broaden customer bases and improve service provisions shows its excellence.\n\nFor example, acquiring new school districts and ongoing talks with potential clients drove a\u00a019.1% revenue rise in the K\u201312 education category in Q1 2024. Hence, this industry-specific development highlights RCM Technologies\u2019 expertise in educational staffing solutions and its ability to capitalize on current connections to drive growth.\n\nLastly, the company\u2019s engineering branch also performed admirably, increasing gross profit by\u00a027.1%.\n\nOverall, RCM Technologies\u2019 growth is driven by sector-specific strategies, making it a top mark on the high-growth stocks list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia stock soared to record highs following its 10-for-1 split. Following that increase, it became the stock with the world's largest market cap. Another chip giant, Broadcom, is far from such an achievement but has shot higher since announcing its own split.\n\nGiven those reactions, such a move could be next for other AI stocks that announce stock splits. The question for investors is which stocks will make such a move. While the answer to that question remains to be seen, a similar increase could happen for the following stocks:\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) should emerge as a stock-split candidate. Despite a worldwide reach and a stock that has traded since 2007, it was a server manufacturer largely unknown outside its industry.\n\nThat changed when it and Nvidia announced a partnership. Consequently, Supermicro stock has outperformed Nvidia's over the last year. SMCI Chart\n\nThe increase briefly took its share price above $1,000 in March, and despite the surge, it could be undervalued.\n\nThanks to revenue growth estimated to reach 110% this year, analysts forecast nearly $24 per share in net income. That is quite a feat, considering that its share price was $24 as recently as four years ago.\n\nDespite that increase, Supermicro's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 52, which is a low valuation given the growth rate. That growth and the possible catalyst of a lower nominal share price after a split could be what Supermicro needs to keep moving higher.\n\nASML\n\nASML(NASDAQ: ASML) remains a relatively unknown semiconductor stock. Nonetheless, it is one of the most crucial chip companies because it builds the most advanced extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines.\n\nHence, manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung need its machines to make their cutting-edge chips.\n\nMoreover, countries want to move more manufacturing away from Taiwan, the island that produces about two-thirds of the world's chips. That fear has led to tens of billions in subsidies going into ASML's industry.\n\nThe AI-driven demand for chips has become a boon to ASML as chip fabricators scramble to increase capacity. Investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom have bid its stock price higher, and it is up more than 430% over the last five years, taking its stock price to around $1,050 as of this writing.\n\nThe run-up has taken the P/E to a lofty 54. Nonetheless, the demand for EUV machines likely means its long-term growth continues, and a split in the near future improves the chances of ASML moving higher in the short term as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAs one of the largest cloud providers, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) plays a key role in running AI applications. It was one of the companies that built an alliance with OpenAI, whose ChatGPT platform makes it a more crucial AI company.\n\nThat led investors to bid the stock price higher by more than 30% over the last year, giving Microsoft the world's largest market cap for most of the year.\n\nAmid its rising value, the company still trades at around $450 per share, which might not inspire most companies to split shares in today's market.\n\nHowever, investors often forget that it is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since that is a price-weighted index, a higher nominal price gives Microsoft a disproportionate influence over the Dow. Thus, the index tends to pressure its members to split their stocks when the price becomes high.\n\nGiven the bump that benefited Nvidia and Broadcom, such pressure could be a blessing in disguise. A stock split could give Microsoft investors a reason to bid its stock higher despite its 39 P/E ratio, possibly meaning a split will happen sooner rather than later.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nEveryone is so gaga for AI these days that whenever I encounter skepticism, it piques my interest.\n\nThat\u2019s why Guggenheim\u2019s latest note on IT spending caught my eye. Lead analyst John DiFucci calls for a \u201cnew normal\u201d for software companies \u2014 a reality in which enterprise budget growth is not going to reaccelerate anytime soon. He based that outlook, in part, on data from tech researcher ETR that shows July IT budget growth expectations are about the same as last year\u2019s.\n\nWhat about the AI spending boom? What about Nvidia\u2019s parabolic sales increases as companies build up their data center firepower to build their large language models and prepare for the AI age?\n\nThat hasn\u2019t made its way to software, DiFucci argues. That\u2019s partly because of cost, and it seems partly because companies haven\u2019t yet figured out what AI is useful for. (As I wrote recently, that\u2019s the case with consumers as well).\n\nCorporations may end up spending on GenAI eventually, just not yet.\n\n\u201cMost of the spending on AI is being done by AI companies and Public Cloud companies preparing to run AI workloads for AI companies,\u201d DiFucci wrote. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see that shift at some point, when corporations begin to purchase Copilots and other forms of AI en masse, or start to build their own LLMs as the cost to build and train them continues to decline. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case right now.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, companies don\u2019t seem to be holding off on IT spending today in order to spend on AI tomorrow: \u201cGiven the uncertainty regarding what AI spending will be useful to corporations, we do not think that expectations for future AI spending is driving what appears to be a more challenging IT spending environment today.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbuild it and they will come\u201d approach on the part of companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta may well pay off down the line.\n\nBut despite some analysts\u2019 insistence that this is the year that AI proves itself in practice (Forbes called this \u201cthe year of AI practicality\u201d), it\u2019s still unclear exactly how.\n\nTo DiFucci, that means about half of the software companies he covers may have to reset lofty AI-related revenue expectations. That includes firms like Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, and Workday.\n\nAt the same time, there are many corporate leaders who will tell you (a little too eagerly, perhaps) how they \u2014 and their clients \u2014 are already using AI. But as Jefferies\u2019 Brent Thill said earlier this year, it won\u2019t be until 2025 that that revenue will start to materialize.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf corporate number-crunchers are keeping the purse strings tight, AI may have to prove its worth before they start spending.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Bigger Than Nvidia in 2030",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already reshaping the corporate world. Chatbot applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT can instantly craft text, images, videos, and computer code on command, which could drive a productivity boom worth trillions of dollars across the global economy.\n\nDeveloping those AI applications wouldn't be possible without the data center graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). They contributed to an astronomical 427% increase in Nvidia's data center revenue in the recent quarter, pushing sales to a record $22.6 billion.\n\nThat growth is the reason Nvidia's valuation recently topped $3.2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nNvidia's incredible run won't last forever\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) describes the point when AI matches human intelligence across most cognitive tasks. Some researchers -- including one who worked for OpenAI -- believe AGI could be achieved as soon as 2027 given the lightning-fast pace of development.\n\nAs is the case with most technologies, the continued advancement of AI beyond that point could yield diminishing returns. In other words, the number of commercial workloads that could benefit from machine intelligence beyond AGI is probably quite small. If that's the case, data center operators won't have to buy every new version of Nvidia's GPUs because the pool of developers who want (or can afford) the performance increase will also shrink.\n\nThat could put the brakes on Nvidia's growth by the end of this decade.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management has been a consistent seller of Nvidia stock this year. Wood believes software companies could generate $8 of revenue for every $1 they invest in Nvidia's chips, so she feels that's where the next opportunity lies. Ark is joined by several billionaire fund managers who have also trimmed their Nvidia holdings recently.\n\nWall Street thinks Nvidia will generate $3.61 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026, giving its stock a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.2. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9 today, so if you believe Nvidia will trade at a market multiple over the long term, investors who buy the stock now will have to wait two years before its earnings catch up to the recent run in its stock price.\n\nOf course, Nvidia stock could also achieve a cheaper P/E ratio by falling. Whichever scenario plays out, here's why I think AI titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be worth more than the chip giant by 2030.\n\nStory continues Image source: Microsoft.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.3 trillion, Microsoft is already slightly bigger than Nvidia. However, if Cathie Wood is right about software being the next big AI opportunity, Microsoft is making all the right moves to extend its market cap advantage through the end of this decade.\n\nAfter announcing plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to create an AI assistant called Copilot. It's available with most of Microsoft's flagship software products.\n\nFor example, businesses can now pay an additional monthly subscription fee to access the Copilot-enabled version of 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more). With 400 million enterprise seats potentially eligible for that upgrade, it could translate into billions of dollars in extra annual recurring revenue for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform has also become a distributor of the latest AI models for tens of thousands of organizations. That includes 65% of the Fortune 500 companies that are using the Azure OpenAI Service to build their own AI applications, utilizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as a base.\n\nMicrosoft is on track to generate $244.9 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30), which is more than Nvidia is expected to generate nearly two years from now. Plus, Microsoft's current P/E ratio of 38.1 is a whopping 45% discount to Nvidia's current P/E ratio of 70.2. It's actually closer to where Nvidia's P/E ratio is expected to be in fiscal 2026, as I highlighted earlier.\n\nMicrosoft has a track record of success spanning almost five decades, and so long as the company continues to grow on the top and bottom lines, its market cap will likely increase in the coming years, whereas Nvidia faces downside risks.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is another $3 trillion giant, and it might also have an edge over Nvidia in the long run thanks to its incredible hardware and software ecosystem. There are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, led by the flagship iPhone, and the company will use that installed base to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nIt will achieve that through Apple Intelligence, which is set to launch in September within the new iOS 18 operating system. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, so it will feature industry-leading models that promise to transform Apple's existing software. For example, the Siri voice assistant will draw on the expansive knowledge of ChatGPT, and apps like Mail, Notes, and Messages will be overhauled with a host of new writing tools to help users draft content more quickly.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to drive a large upgrade cycle when the hotly anticipated iPhone 16 launches later this year, because rumors suggest it will feature a more powerful chip designed specifically for processing AI workloads. This will unlock a much faster experience for users who wish to lean on AI day-to-day.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to generate $386 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ending September 30), which is more than Microsoft and Nvidia combined in their current fiscal years. Plus, Apple trades at a P/E ratio of 32.2 at the moment, so it's cheaper than both of its $3 trillion peers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is already reaping substantial financial rewards from AI, Apple's AI story is only just beginning, and it could have much more long-term potential given the sheer size of its ecosystem. Image source: Alphabet.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. Google Search currently dominates the internet search industry with a 90% market share, but there have been concerns about AI applications like ChatGPT eroding its advantage. Simply put, chatbots offer a more convenient way to access information compared to traditional search, which requires the user to sift through web pages for answers.\n\nAlphabet responded to that threat by launching a series of AI chatbots of its own, culminating in the new Gemini models. Plus, the traditional Google Search experience now uses generative AI to provide users with text-based answers to their queries at the top of the page, saving them from visiting third-party web pages.\n\nThose two initiatives should protect the platform's dominance, and there was evidence of that in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue generated from Google Search increased by 14.3% compared to the year-ago period, marking the fastest growth rate in almost two years.\n\nPlus, Alphabet now offers Gemini to existing Google Workspace subscribers for an additional fee, where they can integrate it with Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more to help users boost their productivity with AI. It's similar to the way Microsoft is offering Copilot for 365, and it effectively creates a new recurring revenue stream for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet stock trades at a P/E ratio of about 27.5 right now, so not only is it much cheaper than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, but it's also cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index. If Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Alphabet stock looks like an absolute bargain right now compared to Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy That Are Up 100% Over the Past 52 Weeks",
        "content": "Morningstar.com recently discussed how GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock has skyrocketed over the past 12 months, gaining 86%, with more than half the gains in 2024. Apparently momentum plays like GE have become the stocks to buy entering the second half of the year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that GE\u2019s become a momentum stock after lying dormant for so many years. Kudos to CEO Larry Culp for the job he\u2019s done delivering value for long-suffering shareholders.\n\nGE isn\u2019t the only stock that skyrocketed over the past year. According to Finviz.com, there are 67 U.S.-listed stocks (market cap of $2 billion or higher) that have achieved a 100% retunrn or more over the past 52 weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock with the largest market capitalization that doubled its money over the past year is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the AI superstar. The stock with the smallest market cap to do so is Amneal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMRX), a producer of more than 280 generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.\n\nHere are three more to add to your list of stocks to buy.\n\nModine Manufacturing (MOD) The front of a Modine Manufacturing (MOD) facility with the company name and logo present.\n\nSource: Tony Savino / Shutterstock.com\n\nModine Manufacturing (NYSE:MOD) has a $4.92 billion market cap as I write this with a 201% gain over the past 52 weeks.\n\nMost investors would never think it\u2019s possible for a company that\u2019s over a hundred years old to be able to triple its market cap in a single year, but that\u2019s precisely what Modine has done since last June.\n\nFounded in 1916 by Arthur B. Modine, the company started by manufacturing thermal solutions for the emerging automobile industry. Since then it\u2019s taken its business global, providing thermal solutions in many different markets including HVAC, data centers, and automotive.\n\nIn May, it reported its Q4 2024 and full-year results. In 2024, its sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion, while its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped 48% to $314 million, a healthy EBITDA margin of 13.1%.\n\nIt has two operating segments: Climate Solutions (43% of sales) and Performance Technologies (57%).\n\nIn 2025, it expects sales to grow by 7.5% at the midpoint of its guidance with an adjusted EBITDA of $375 million, nearly 20% higher than in 2024.\n\nIn November 2023, I recommended investors consider buying MOD stock because it was growing its free cash flow by focusing on higher-margin markets. So far, it\u2019s working like a charm.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has a $105.72 billion market cap with a 124% gain over the past 52 weeks. Since it went public in June 2014 at $43, its stock has appreciated by 3,038%, which includes a four-for-one stock split in November 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cloud networking stock has done well in 2024 due to the emergence of AI. Its networking products help AI leaders such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) \u2014 the two companies account for approximately 39% of its overall revenue \u2014 carry out AI workloads requiring efficient data-throughput for its GPU networks.\n\nIts Q1 2024 revenue increased 16.3% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Sequentially, its sales grew 2.0% from Q4 2023. Meanwhile, its non-GAAP net income jumped 40.9% to $637.7 million. Its earnings per share rose at a slightly slower rate of 39.2% due to more shares outstanding.\n\nOf the 27 analysts covering ANET stock, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $327.50 target price, below where it\u2019s currently trading.\n\nThe company\u2019s steady-as-she-goes performance should continue to deliver solid long-term returns for its shareholders.\u00a0If you are looking for the top stocks to buy, start here.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Picture of a highway system with business statistics on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.\n\nSource: ekapol sirachainan / Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NYSE:STRL) has a $3.59 billion market cap with a 123% gain over the past 52 weeks.\n\nIn the same November 2023 article recommendeding Modine, I also recommended Sterling Infrastructure. My rationale was simple: It continues to benefit from rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nIt finished the first quarter with a $2.35 billion backlog. Due to the strong start to 2024, it now expects revenues to grow by 12% year over year, net income to increase by 23%, and a 16% increase in EBITDA.\n\nMost importantly, its cash flow has grown considerably, from $25 million in 2017, to $479 million in 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 64%. Based on 2023 free cash flow of $428 million and an enterprise value of $3.50 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 12.2%. Anything above 8% is value territory.\n\nInvestors can expect its free cash flow to continue to grow given its focus on strategic acquisitions.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that the best use of our cash is strategic acquisitions that expand our suite of services, enhance our competitive position, or expand our geographic reach,\u201d stated its 2023 annual report.\n\n\u201cWe remain very active in the pursuit of potential targets, with particular focus in E-Infrastructure Solutions and Building Solutions.\u201d\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian chipmaking stocks rose on Wednesday, tracking an overnight rebound in market darling Nvidia as investors looked to an artificial intelligence driven boom in demand over the coming months.\n\nStocks closely tied to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) were the best performers among their peers, after the firm surged nearly 7% in Tuesday\u2019s session. The rebound came after a mix of profit taking and cooling sentiment sparked three straight days of steep losses in Nvidia.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660), which supplies advanced memory chips to Nvidia, rose 4.2%, while Japanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO:6857), which is also an Nvidia supplier, added 6.6%.\n\nTSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker and one of Nvidia\u2019s biggest suppliers, added 1.1%, while electronics maker Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317), also known as Foxconn, added 0.5%.\n\nNvidia\u2019s rebound, which saw the company reclaim a $3 trillion market capitalization, reflected persistent optimism that the firm will benefit from an AI boom in the coming months.\n\nNvidia had briefly overtaken Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to become the most valuable company on Wall Street last week, amid hype over AI.\n\nAI is also expected to boost global chip demand- a notion which saw broader Asian chip stocks advance on Wednesday. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), China\u2019s biggest chipmaker, rose 1%, while Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO:8035) and Renesas Electronics Corp (TYO:6723) added 3.2% and 2%, respectively.\n\nMarkets were now awaiting more cues on AI-driven chip demand from Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which is set to report its quarterly earnings later on Wednesday. The firm had clocked stronger-than-expected earnings in the prior quarter on strong demand, and had also presented a stronger outlook.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian chipmaking stocks rise tracking Nvidia rebound\n\nAsian stocks buoyed by tech gains, Australia sinks on hot CPI\n\nAmericans seek out cooler destinations for July 4 travel as temperatures sizzle\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nEuropean regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge Tuesday, one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple (AAPL) with violating European Union competition law.\n\nThe European Commission (EC), the EU\u2019s antitrust authority, said it informed Microsoft of its view that the tech giant had been illegally bundling \u2014 or \"tying\" \u2014 its Teams software to other proprietary business software, including Office 365 and Microsoft 365. Microsoft offices in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, France. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nTying the software applications together, according to the EC, violates the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits abuse of dominant market positions.\n\nFines for violations can run up to 10% of a company\u2019s worldwide annual revenue. For Microsoft, global revenue in 2023 totaled $212 billion.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said the company has already untethered Teams from some of its other software products.\n\n\"We appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the commission\u2018s remaining concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe EC on Monday took a similar step against Apple, informing the iPhone maker that the rules for its lucrative App Store violated a different antitrust law \u2014 the EU\u2019s recently enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA) \u2014 by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the store.\n\nApple defended its practices, saying, \"We are confident our plan complies with the law.\"\n\nThe actions this week are the latest examples of how the EU is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data and social media content, as well as the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers, and it readied the world\u2019s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US. European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. (REUTERS/Johanna Geron) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, even though that industrial union had received approval in the US.\n\nIn 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions.\n\nIn more recent years, the EU\u2019s attempt to rein in tech giants has become a core focus. The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations on companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years \u2014 the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act\u2014 that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft, and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\nThe charges announced this week against Microsoft and Apple are detailed in separate legal filings, or statements of objection, that detail the EC\u2019s investigative evidence and justifications for its claims. An Apple store in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn its statement outlining the charges against Microsoft, the EC said the tech giant\u2019s practices may have granted Teams a distribution advantage because customers had no choice about whether to acquire access to Teams when subscribing to the company\u2019s software productivity applications.\n\nThe commission went on to say that Microsoft imposed interoperability limitations on competing software with Teams, and that those limitations may have prevented competition, stifled innovation, and disadvantaged consumers.\n\nComplaints over Microsoft\u2019s software bundles originated back in 2020 when Salesforce-owned Slack, a business software competitor, claimed the company was abusing its market power.\n\nThe EC\u2019s investigations into the matter led Microsoft in October 2023 to untether Teams from some of its other software products. In April, it applied the change globally.\n\nMicrosoft will now have an opportunity to present its own evidence in response to the objections before the EC issues a final decision on whether or not the bloc\u2019s antitrust laws were breached.\n\nThe EC\u2019s final determinations are handled through administrative proceedings without a trial. However, appeals from the Commission\u2019s final determination can be made to the European Court of Justice.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A $430 billion sell-off over the past three trading days in artificial intelligence darling Nvidia Corp. is no more than a blip to Neuberger Berman Group\u2019s Steve Eisman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show \u2018Hot Ones\u2019 Jain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi How Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange to Plead Guilty, Ending Yearslong US Battle\n\nThe senior portfolio manager, best known for his short bet against subprime mortgages ahead of the global financial crisis, owns \u201ca lot\u201d of the chipmaker\u2019s shares and considers it a long-term play that\u2019s going to be relevant for years to come, he said Tuesday in an an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nThe stock gained as much as 4.1% on Tuesday, after a three-day slide that pushed shares down more than 10% for the first time since April, past the threshold that represents a correction.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the chart on Nvidia, you can barely see the correction,\u201d Eisman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it means anything.\u201d\n\nThe AI poster-child has soared this year amid a furious appetite for its chips that dominate the market for artificial-intelligence computing. Its latest climb saw shares surge 43% from its May 22 earnings report and stock-split announcement to the June 18 peak, when it toppled Microsoft Corp. to become the world\u2019s most valuable company \u2014 a title it has since lost.\n\nNvidia is still up 139% this year through Monday\u2019s close. As some skeptics worry that the company has grown too quickly, Eisman says price is the last thing to fret over.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I learned running a hedge fund is that shorting a stock solely because of valuation is a death wish,\u201d he said, adding that people purchase a stock even when it\u2019s perceived to be expensive because they\u2019re buying into a story. \u201cAs long as the story is intact \u2014 like Nvidia is obviously intact \u2014 the story is going to continue. I don\u2019t think all that much about the valuation of Nvidia.\u201d\n\nThe message that Nvidia will continue to benefit from booming AI demand was echoed by Nuveen Asset Management LLC\u2019s chief investment officer.\n\n\u201cNvidia is the company that wins in this space, basically no matter what,\u201d Saira Malik said in an interview. \u201cEveryone who wants to shift into AI basically has to use Nvidia\u2019s products. Their growth rate has been so strong that their price-to-earnings really isn\u2019t expensive.\u201d\n\nMalik is a portfolio manager for several key investment strategies for Nuveen, a $1.3 trillion global asset manager. The $125 billion College Retirement Equities Fund - Stock Account, which she oversees, has outperformed 86% of peers over the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, Nvidia, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. were the fund\u2019s biggest holdings as of the end of May.\n\n\u201cPeople will say the stock price itself has just done so well, how can you own it?\u201d Malik said. When compared to peers, \u201cit\u2019s not an expensive stock.\u201d\n\nWhile Nvidia trades at a premium of about 50% to the Nasdaq 100 Index, its 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio has pulled back from a 2023 high of 63 times down to about 40. It\u2019s now valued close to peers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\n\nMalik said the AI-fueled rally in Nvidia and Microsoft \u2014 which has propelled US stock benchmarks to a series of record highs \u2014 is unlike the dot-com bubble.\n\n\u201cThese companies are much more dominant because they are not brand new,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been around for years investing in this trend. So I do think it\u2019s different this time.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein and Ryan Vlastelica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Independence Without Accountability: The Fed\u2019s Great Inflation Fail\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally \u2014 why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme \u2014 not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "content": "OpenAI has already changed the tech industry in big ways. Indeed, this technology has even started to impact\u00a0blue-collar sectors after ChatGPT came out.\u00a0That said, it has now been more than a year and a half since ChatGPT\u2019s release. And while there have been better and better AI chatbots\u00a0being released, you\u2019d\u00a0be forgiven\u00a0for thinking that the AI magic is starting to wear off. People are no longer surprised by what AI can do these days.\n\nI think that\u00a0could change once OpenAI releases its Sora text-to-video AI system.\u00a0The company has released many preview videos along with certain prompts, and by all accounts, there\u2019s a lot here.\u00a0I believe\u00a0this technology could be revolutionary for content creators.\u00a0People spend\u00a0a good chunk\u00a0of their free time watching videos on various platforms.\u00a0Once Sora becomes available to the public,\u00a0I think\u00a0it could see a lot of usage.\n\nHere are three stocks you might want to look into to ride this growth wave higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) ChatGPT logo seen on the smartphone, Microsoft (MSFT) logo seen on the laptop. Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant\u00a0providing\u00a0cloud computing and productivity software. I believe Microsoft is uniquely-positioned to be the primary beneficiary of OpenAI\u2019s Sora and the broader AI revolution. The company\u2019s early investments in OpenAI have not only\u00a0kickstarted\u00a0the current AI rally, but also\u00a0gave\u00a0Microsoft significant leverage over OpenAI\u2019s profits.\u00a0Reports suggest Microsoft will receive 75% of OpenAI\u2019s profits until it recoups its investment, followed by a 49% share until it earns $92 billion\u00a0in profit.\n\nRegardless, the partnership has already paid dividends, with\u00a0over 65% of Fortune 500 companies\u00a0now\u00a0using Azure OpenAI Service. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while $10 million-plus deals more than doubled.\n\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 is already seeing accelerated adoption, with nearly 60% of Fortune 500 companies now using it. The white-collar industry can\u2019t live without Microsoft, and the company has been a growth compounder for years. Recently, it appears these trends have only been accelerating.\u00a0I think MSFT stock\u00a0is one of the best long-term bets you can make, independent of how OpenAI\u2019s Sora AI plays out.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) makes software for digital content producers. The company\u2019s strong Q2 2024 results highlight the growing appeal of its AI-powered creative tools. Revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $5.31 billion, beating estimates, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.48\u00a0also\u00a0exceeded expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nI believe\u00a0Adobe is well-positioned to benefit from the AI mega trend, especially with the impending launch of OpenAI\u2019s Sora text-to-video model. The company has\u00a0already\u00a0successfully integrated generative AI into flagship products like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Lightroom. Since debuting in March 2023, Adobe\u2019s Firefly AI has generated over 9 billion images across its creative apps.\n\nHowever,\u00a0I think\u00a0Sora could take Adobe\u2019s offerings to a whole new level, especially in the video editing\u00a0space, where Adobe is already very popular.\n\nWhile Adobe\u2019s stock is still down 19.5% from its peak, it has rebounded 10.4% over the past month.\u00a0Given the strong Q2 results and AI tailwinds,\u00a0I believe\u00a0this presents an attractive opportunity to buy the dip.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) a cityscape at sunrise connected by 1's and 0's with implied internet connection points. representing ayx stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) designs and manufactures data storage devices and solutions.\u00a0WDC\u00a0stock has soared over 100% over the past year alone.\u00a0I believe this momentum could accelerate further as the AI and data boom kicks into high gear.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Western Digital delivered impressive results, with\u00a0earnings per share of 63 cents beating estimates by 42 cents. Revenue also came in at $3.46 billion, growing a robust 23.33%\u00a0year-over-year.\u00a0Management highlighted the company\u2019s surging demand in its core data center segment as a key driver of this growth. As more companies develop their own AI models, including advanced text-to-video systems, the need for Western Digital\u2019s storage solutions should only intensify.\n\nIf text-based AI alone can fuel such a data boom, I can only imagine the storage demand that Sora\u2019s crisp, AI-generated videos might unleash. Western Digital seems perfectly-positioned to ride this coming tsunami of data growth. With its stock already having doubled, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see WDC stock continuing to climb higher. However, investors may still want to be somewhat cautious with this name, since we could still be near a cyclical high.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the\u00a0Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs mega-cap technology stocks continue to soar to new highs, the number of Wall Street analysts highlighting the \u201cconcentration of gains\u201d problem are increasing. It\u2019s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that \u201cBig Tech\u201d has \u00a0\u201clargely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.\u201d Krishna said that Q1 results showed the \u201congoing dominance\u201d of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\n\u201cThis makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,\u201d Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s New AI Fund\n\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet \u201con and against\u201d companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez. The fund\u2019s expected launch date is later this year or early 2025.\n\nBillionaire Cohen is already ramping up his bets on AI. To see his AI investments this year, click\u00a010 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nSince Krishna of Barclays talked about the rise of big tech funds and their concentration into AI, in this article we will take a look at the major AI stocks that form the portfolios of these funds and discuss their growth catalysts and long-term outlook. For that we first listed down all holdings of major tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and iShares Global Tech ETF and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Are Big Tech Funds Buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI Stock?\n\ntanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nBarclays Venu Krishna recently pointed out in a research report that mutual funds are piling into big tech stocks like Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0shares are up about 30% over the past one year. Many other Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). New Street Research recently started covering the stock with a Buy rating, saying Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0is well positioned to grow earnings in the low teens for \u201cyears to come\u201d even if the AI story fails to pan out. The firm set a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOur second largest purchase during the quarter was the software platform,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which we continued to add to, after initiating a position in the fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially). Management also noted that large cloud optimizations that started a year or so ago have largely finished. Profitability also continues to be strong with 44% non-GAAP operating margins, which was 120bps better than expected.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below. META Chart\n\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023). Top Tech Tech stocks owned by billionaires\n\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet\n\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\n\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\n\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\n\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\n\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\n\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\n\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below. META PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\n\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function. So-called hyperscaler data centers (many over 100,000 square feet) are expected to increase by over 100 annually for the next decade, according to one source, providing Nvidia with a long runway still.\n\nNvidia didn't disappoint in the first quarter, posting a 262% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $26 billion. Its data center sales exploded again to $23 billion, a 427% year-over-year increase. The 10-for-1 stock split also excited investors, although stock splits have no direct effect on the company's or shareholders' value.\n\nOf the 16 billionaire portfolios studied, Nvidia is in the top-10 tech holdings of 10, with several having it in the top three. However, new investors in Nvidia should consider the valuation before jumping in with both feet.\n\nIts current P/E is more than 70. This drops to 47 on a forward basis but still dwarfs Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) own lofty valuation.\n\nNvidia will have a long, prosperous future, but consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for a dip to accumulate shares now.\n\nMost billionaires didn't get wealthy by accident. These hedge funds study data, hire industry experts, and make shrewd stock buys. While investors should not blindly follow their lead, examining their top picks is a terrific place to get ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Record-Breaking Stocks With More Room to Run",
        "content": "U.S. markets continued to set all-time highs in June, with record-breaking stocks boosting major indices to new records last week. Even the traditionally slower DJIA logged two consecutive record peaks in two days.\n\nThe market appears to favor the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) greatly as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) battle for the highest market capitalization in the world. Such lofty heights in the market typically provoke fears of a correction, but pulling back may not be the case just yet.\r\n\r\nBullish bets from traders are also hitting record highs, especially on the top-performing stocks. Options trading reveals the number of calls exceeds the number of puts by 4.5 million contracts, the highest in history. Not surprisingly, a large portion of calls support the mega caps that have been outperforming so far this year. However, it strongly suggests that traders feel the current bullish run has more room to run. This points to a rising interest in betting on record-breaking stocks.\r\n\r\nWhen seeking those with more room to run, there are multiple alternatives to examine. One way to distinguish the strong performers from the rest is to vet analyst recommendations. The following three record-breaking stocks with a high number of analysts recommending a buy could have further growth potential.\n\nLife360 (LIF) An image of a man typing on a laptop overlayed with lines of code.\n\nThe family safety app Life360 (NASDAQ:LIF) came to market only earlier this month. It is a reasonable choice as one of the record-breaking stocks with more to run due to its post-IPO success. After first trading at $27 per share, the price steadily increased throughout the month and now changes hands at $31.21 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the company is not yet profitable and has not released earnings results as a public firm, analysts have been highly positive in their coverage. Thirteen analysts have issued reports on Life360 so far, with 11 recommending the stock as a Buy. The average target price given is $52.07 per share, representing a potential upside of 67%.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that a newly public company sees strong bullish momentum, especially in the social media sector.\n\nLife360 offers both a free and paid app for tracking the location of loved ones and their belongings. It boasts a staggering 66 million active users to date.\n\nBoston Scientific (BSX) a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web page\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) has experienced long-term success in medical device markets. It is renowned for developing the Taxus Stent, which is used to treat blocked arteries. However, the company also creates a wide array of sophisticated devices across medical specialties.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs healthcare is a perpetually necessary industry, Boston Scientific is well-positioned for continued growth. Heart attacks remain the main cause of death in the United States, ensuring demand for preventative products over the long run.\n\nBSX stock price reached a record high last week following the announcement of an acquisition of carotid artery disease firm Silk Road Medical (NASDAQ:SILK). Not unexpectedly, after setting a new record, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio increased substantially to 65.3x. Still, biotech has a high average P/E ratio, rendering Boston Scientific\u2019s figure relatively consistent with the sector\u2019s 58.5x.\n\nAnalysts anticipate ongoing expansion, with an average price target of $82.93 representing a modest projected upside of 6.7%. The forecast suggests the recent record high will unlikely cap the company\u2019s performance, making Boston one of the record-breaking stocks with more room to run.\n\nCrane NXT (CXT) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks to sell\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrane NXT (NYSE:CXT) is the final selection of record-breaking stocks with more room to run. It provides micro-optic security products widely used without notice, as well as special marks on currency that allow for authentication and protection.\n\nThe company recently completed the acquisition of OpSec Security to enhance its portfolio of online protection and product authentication solutions.\n\nCrane achieved record stock prices after appointing a new head of its payments division, which accounts for two-thirds of total revenue. Michael Mahan\u2019s appointment will become effective on July 8.\r\n\r\nDespite a 14% year-to-date growth exceeding the average for S&P 500 firms, CXT stock trades at a peer-comparable P/E ratio of 20x. Given its involvement in technology, this is in line with industrial companies.\n\nAnalyst coverage remains strongly favorable, with five of six rating it a Buy. The average price target represents a 52% upside at $98.20 per share as the company continues beating EPS estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaires Just Poured About $67 Billion Into These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to revolutionize our lives -- at least if big tech is to be believed. Plenty of products already hit the market, like ChatGPT, and while they have made a splash, the technology's true impact has yet to be felt. That promise of more to come is driving incredible growth for companies involved in AI.\n\nTop fund managers are snapping up shares of these businesses as they try to capture as much value from the technology's explosive growth as possible. Funds with more than $100 million in assets under management need to report their trades every quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission on form 13F. Lucky for us, it's public knowledge.\n\nKnowing where the \"smart money\" is flowing can help you make sound decisions, but it should only be part of your information gathering. It turns out that the smart money isn't always so smart -- and besides, there are plenty of managers selling shares of all of the following five stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTo perhaps no one's surprise, the company with the most hedge-fund buys was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It captured the investing world's imagination after positioning itself as the go-to chipmaker for all things AI.\n\nIts revenue growth has been incredible, and it's done it all while keeping costs relatively low. The chart below measuring the growth of its net income over the past three years shows the point where AI took off. NVDA Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $15.9 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $6.2 billion from Vanguard and $1.8 billion by BlackRock.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nOne of my favorite AI plays, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), runs the largest cloud computing operation in the world, Amazon Web Service (AWS), controlling over 30% of the cloud market and is investing heavily to maintain this share. It partners with Nvidia to outfit its data centers with the latest and most powerful chips, and it put $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic.\n\nFund managers bought $14.4 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.5 billion (Vanguard) and $1.9 billion (BlackRock).\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nAnother solid AI play, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), backs OpenAI, the maker of the most popular AI application, ChatGPT. When OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 to the public, it became the most quickly adopted technology in history. For much of the public, ChatGPT is as far as their knowledge of AI goes, unaware of Anthropic's offering or Alphabet's.\n\nMicrosoft is No. 2 in the cloud and has been slowly eating into AWS' market share. Its partnership with OpenAI means Microsoft has the most-used AI application in the world on its servers. And Microsoft is also outfitting them with Nvidia chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nFund managers bought $13.1 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.8 billion (BlackRock) and $1.3 billion from Geode Capital Management.\n\n4. Apple\n\nThis one is different from the previous three. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares slid for much of last year as investors worried it had fallen behind in AI.\n\nBut the company finally jumped on board this month, unveiling Apple Intelligence, its cleverly named AI offering. Its products will have all sorts of AI enhancements (maybe now Siri will actually know what I ask her to do).\n\nCrucially, the enhancements will require too much computing power for many older products in Apple's lineup, forcing users to upgrade to the latest (and most expensive) models. This will help boost the company's sagging iPhone sales, an essential part of its bottom line.\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.3 billion (Geode Capital) and $983.9 million by Lazard.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) supplies hardware to the AI industry. They don't compete head to head, leaving Nvidia to dominate the core chip market. But one of the most crucial components in AI data centers is the one that allows all of those chips to talk to one another fast enough and seamlessly, which is where Broadcom comes in. Broadcom is a top designer, manufacturer, and supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Its product offerings serve the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets.\n\nThe company also made some key acquisitions that have driven immense growth, as the revenue chart below shows. (It also indicates an inflection point close to the one in Nvidia's chart above.) AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.6 billion (Vanguard) and $1.5 billion from Jennison Associates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are muted following a drop in AI-exposed chipmaking stocks in the prior session. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped in particular, extending a decline in the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized processors into a third straight day. Elsewhere, meme-stock investor Roaring Kitty's stake in GameStop (NYSE:GME) falls into the red, according to the Financial Times, while the price of Bitcoin dips in volatile trading.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered close to the flatline on Tuesday after a mixed previous session highlighted by a drop in many artificial intelligence-related equities.\n\nBy 03:29 ET (07:29 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 37 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures were broadly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 10 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a one-month high on Monday, as some investors rotated out of AI-exposed semiconductor firms like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in favor of other sectors such as energy. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and AI-darling, dipped for a third consecutive session (more below).\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest one-day decline in nearly two months, while the benchmark S&P 500 ended the trading day 0.3% lower.\n\nMarkets are looking ahead to the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index report -- the Federal Reserve's preferred metric of inflation -- on Friday. The reading, which is tipped to show an easing in price pressures, could influence expectations for potential Fed interest rate reductions later this year.\n\n2. Nvidia shares tumble\n\nNvidia shares fell another 6.7% on Monday, extending losses for a third straight session and erasing more than $430 billion in market capitalization over the three-day slide.\n\nThe California-based AI chipmaker ended last week with a market valuation of around $3.1 trillion, lower than Apple\u2019s $3.2 trillion and Microsoft\u2019s $3.3 trillion. The group briefly overtook Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last week to become the most valuable company in the world.\n\nDespite the recent slide, Nvidia shares have surged by 138% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the downside move has more to do with sector rotation and profit-taking than fundamental issues at the business.\n\nOn Monday, analysts at Jefferies raised their price target to $150 per share from $135 while reiterating a Buy rating, arguing that \"Nvidia remains both king and kingmaker\" in the AI sector.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Roaring Kitty slips into the red - FT\n\nA drop in shares in videogame retailer GameStop briefly pushed meme-stock influencer Keith Gill's position down into the red on Monday, according to analysis from the Financial Times.\n\nShares in GameStop, which had spiked last month in the wake of Gill's return to social media after a three-year absence, dipped below the $23.4135 price he paid for his 2.1% stake, the FT said.\n\nThe stock closed at $23.65, above Gill's purchase price but down by roughly 1.2% for the day. It has now slumped by more than 17% over the past five sessions.\n\n4. Bitcoin volatile\n\nBitcoin moved lower on Tuesday in volaile trading, as a mix of regulatory fears, particularly over U.S. action and German government sales, coupled with broader risk aversion, kept crypto prices under pressure.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had fallen 2.5% in the past 24 hours to $60,908.5 by 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT). It had dropped below the $60,000 mark in overnight trade, but later rebounded back above this level.\n\nBitcoin was nursing steep losses through the past week due in part to reports that the German government was selling tokens confiscated from a piracy website. This may lead to an influx in Bitcoin available in the market.\n\nMeanwhile, other reports said the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission was investigating market maker Jump Trading over its crypto trading activities. Jump President Kanav Kariya also said he was leaving the firm.\n\n5. Crude stable\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday ahead of the release of the latest information regarding U.S. crude inventories during the summer driving season.\n\nBy 07:28 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $81.56 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $85.03 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks rose about 3% last week, marking two straight weeks of gains, boosted by increased demand as the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, enters the peak summer consumption period.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute is set to release its forecast of U.S. crude oil stockpiles later in the session, ahead of the official report on Wednesday, and stocks are expected to have declined in the week to June 21.\n\nThat said, traders are cautious about pushing the market too much higher given that interest rates remain relatively elevated, potentially limiting growth in fuel consumption in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia dips amid drop in chipmaking stocks, Bitcoin choppy - what's moving markets\n\nSri Lanka to sign agreement with creditor nations on Wednesday\n\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss drug approved in China\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.\u2019s three-day, $430 billion selloff has traders turning to technical analysis for clues on where the bottom may be.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Jain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show \u2018Hot Ones\u2019 Nvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can\u2019t Keep Up Tech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\n\nThe stock has fallen 13% since briefly overtaking Microsoft Corp. last week as the world\u2019s most valuable company. That\u2019s pushed Nvidia shares into a technical correction \u2013 when a stock drops 10% or more from a recent peak \u2014 for the first time since April. The abrupt reversal has included some tell-tale signs of capitulation, according to Buff Dormeier, chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners.\n\n\u201cThe fact that this is happening following all this good news \u2014 the split, becoming the largest company \u2014 is a concern,\u201d he said, referring to the 10-for-1 stock split announced last month. Dormeier sees short-term support around the $115 level, with the next significant level at $100.\n\nThe $115 area for Nvidia shares is near a key Fibonacci retracement level, a tool used by technical analysts to identify support or resistance lines for stocks and other assets. The 38.2% retracement from the stock\u2019s intraday low in April to its record high last week is about 2% below Monday\u2019s closing price.\n\nWhile technical analysis \u2014 which looks for insight in historic trading patterns \u2014 isn\u2019t precise, it can provide a useful roadmap for investors.\n\nNvidia has soared this year amid unrelenting demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence computing. The latest leg of the advance saw the stock rise 43% from its May 22 earnings report and stock split announcement to the June 18 peak when the stock closed with a market value of $3.34 trillion, topping Microsoft at $3.32 trillion. Despite the three-day drop since then, Nvidia is still up 139% this year.\n\nFor Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, the longer-term trend is more important than any specific level for Nvidia and it remains strong with Nvidia still trading well above its 50-day moving average around $101 and 100-day moving average at $92.\n\n\u201cTypically major tops are a process, with several rounds of buying and selling and then price momentum creeps in and there\u2019s a failure to hold key levels. We haven\u2019t seen anything like that yet,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is just how Nvidia trades.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile he believes the long-term up trend remains intact, like Dormeier, he\u2019s keeping an eye on the $100 level.\n\n\u201cFor a stock in an uptrend like Nvidia, breaching that first level of support wouldn\u2019t be a concern,\u201d said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Granite Wealth Management. A drop below $100, however, would be, he said.\n\n\u201cThat may not have long-term implications, but it would signal that you should be patient, especially in a period where the market is likely to be volatile and have a downward bias as we await the election and the Fed weighing in on rates.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Microsoft (MSFT) Dipped More Than Broader Market Today",
        "content": "In the latest market close, Microsoft (MSFT) reached $447.67, with a -0.47% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.67%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.09%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the software maker had gained 4.56% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 6.41%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.73%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Microsoft will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Microsoft to post earnings of $2.90 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 7.81%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $64.16 billion, reflecting a 14.19% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nMSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $11.77 per share and revenue of $244.41 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +19.98% and +15.33%, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. Microsoft is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\n\nInvestors should also note Microsoft's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 38.22. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 27.91.\n\nInvestors should also note that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.37 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.45.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 93, finds itself in the top 37% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow MSFT in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 6% on Monday as investors rotated out of the hottest AI play of the year. The session marked the third consecutive day of losses for shares of the chip heavyweight.\n\nThe stock declined more than 12% from its all-time closing high of $135.58 last Tuesday when Nvidia's market cap temporarily dethroned Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company.\n\nThe chipmaker has since given back the crown with its market capitalization at around $2.9 trillion, below Microsoft's and Apple's (AAPL) valuations of more than $3 trillion each.\n\nUp until Thursday of last week, Nvidia played a pivotal role in buoying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) to repeated record highs in 2024.\n\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal recently reported, Wall Street is mixed on whether the recent selloff signals long-term concerns with the stock.\n\n\"The stock's steep climb makes it vulnerable to profit taking, but we argue any volatility [is] likely to be short-lived,\" Bank of America analysts stated in a note last week, reiterating a Buy rating and $150 price target while calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\n\nOver the weekend Jefferies analysts maintained a Buy rating on the stock and raised their price target to $150 from $135, calling Nvidia the \"king and kingmaker.\"\n\nMeanwhile Patrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance on Friday that investors should be watchful for signs a pullback is here to stay.\n\nWhile he doesn't see the status quo of Nvidia's dominance changing over the next six to nine months, investors should focus on \"the downstream profitability that people in the ecosystem are making or not making.\"\n\n\"These are the software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow. Because if those enterprises and those consumers aren't paying more for these new AI features, then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, like we saw in the internet bust,\" he explained.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Before the Nvidia Shareholder Meeting on June 26",
        "content": "With the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholder meeting fast approaching, many analysts are speculating how its internal reporting could impact the broader tech industry. This year\u2019s 2024 meeting will likely highlight much of the roaring success the company has seen since the start of 2023 and could set off other tech stocks as a result. As such, the right stocks to buy in preparation for this short-term boost are likely those with close connections to Nvidia\u2019s business model.\n\nHowever, investors should keep in mind that speculative purchases before earnings reports and shareholder meetings can result in losses should the news trigger a broader sell signal. That being said, if you\u2019re adamant about trying to time the news with the stock market, here are three companies likely to see a bump from a strong NVDA annual earnings report. This comes as NVDA stock continues to make history in taking its company\u2019s market capitalization to never-before-seen heights.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nDepending upon the day, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dukes it out with Nvidia for title of the largest by market cap (it currently owns the top spot). The tech giant owes much of its growth to the success of Nvidia\u2019s products. After all, even NVDA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang has stated the company is fueling the next industrial revolution with its graphics processing units (GPUs). Who better to apply its products to the broader tech industry than Microsoft, which holds an eyewatering 72% of the PC operating system market?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s deep interconnection with Nvidia is best exemplified by its Azure data center platforms, which are central to its enterprise-level AI solutions. As a result, Azure has been one of the main drivers of revenue growth for MSFT while keeping it relevant in an increasingly competitive cloud computing space.\n\nBearing these details in mind, if any of the information in NVDA\u2019s upcoming shareholder meeting is positive regarding the progress Nvidia and Microsoft are making toward AI technology, then MSFT stock could see its value rise.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise offices in Palo Alto, CA. HPE stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nOne of Nvidia\u2019s smaller partners when it comes to AI data centers, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) could see its share value bump up in the week of a strong Nvidia shareholder report. That\u2019s because Nvidia often highlights up-and-coming projects and improvements to its partnerships in shareholder meetings.\n\nFurthermore, both companies recently announced an AI cloud product partnership aimed at improving HPE\u2019s AI computing offerings. The deal will involve three HPE servers, powered by eight Nvidia H200 NVL Tensor Core GPUs and the DL384 Gen 12 with GH200 NVL2 accelerators. These represent some of the best computing architecture NVDA has to offer while underscoring a conservative approach to the AI boom for HPE.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese technologies could see the release of better software integration at NVDA\u2019s shareholder meeting or just an announcement about market performance. Either way, HPE\u2019s newly founded relationship with the GPU giant could result in investor excitement following the upcoming Nvidia shareholder meeting.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I discussed last week, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) has been one of Nvidia\u2019s big customers in recent years. This trend stems from the legacy personal computer maker investing extensively in its data center computing infrastructure. Depending on how the Nvidia shareholder meeting addresses this new partnership, Dell could be among the best stocks to buy for a short-term play.\n\nFurthermore, should Nvidia announce new technologies or projects at the meeting, Dell\u2019s increasingly interlinked perception could get a share value boost from investors bullish on NVDA\u2019s new technologies.\n\nUltimately, Dell has proven to be a solid pick in the tech industry this year, with a 94% share value gain year-to-date. Thus, it\u2019s likely this performance will continue so long as it sticks closely to Nvidia\u2019s technological prowess. For investors looking to buy stocks before the Nvidia shareholder meeting, DELL could be both a strong short-term and long-term play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) legal headaches mounted Monday with the news that European Union regulators found it violated a new law designed to rein in tech giants.\n\nThe EU\u2019s European Commission said it informed Apple that the rules of Apple's lucrative App Store violated the Digital Markets Act by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\n\nThe regulator also announced it had opened a separate investigation into Apple\u2019s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny overseas comes as Apple defends itself in the US against antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold onto a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit; it has yet to comment on the new EU actions.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple\u2019s stock up more than 1%.\n\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" \u2014 Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) \u2014 and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\n\nThe law\u2019s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\n\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\n\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\n\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what regulators said Apple did. The logo of Apple is illuminated at a store in Munich, Germany, in 2020. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\n\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company\u2019s global annual revenue. In Apple\u2019s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\n\nApple doesn\u2019t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category that includes the store\u2019s revenue reached $85 billion that same year.\n\nThe EC\u2019s announcement significantly broadened financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple\u2019s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 Euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify, targeted Apple\u2019s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\n\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "More exciting things are happening inside the market than Nvidia stock (NVDA) going up almost every day.\n\nVeteran New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) floor trader and co-founder of Wall Street Global Trading Academy Peter Tuchman pointed to the bull market in stocks ushering in 40 million new retail investors into the market over the past few years as very \"exciting.\"\n\nAs a result of this influx, household net worth remains on the ascent.\n\nUS household wealth rose to a record of more than $160 trillion in the first quarter, according to the latest data out of the Federal Reserve. During that time, household net worth rose by 3.2%, or $5.1 trillion, with the appreciation in stock prices accounting for $3.8 trillion of the gain.\n\n\u201cWe are at the crossroads,\u201d Tuchman said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \u201cWe are in an extraordinary time and history.\"\n\nThese new retail investors have broadened their exposure beyond popular meme names such as GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC), which dominated Robinhood (HOOD) trading accounts in 2021.\n\nThe latest Robinhood Investor Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 most owned investments on the trading platform, shows that retail investors have plowed into companies they understand and that impact their daily lives, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAnd yes, Nvidia.\n\nMaking investing more accessible to more people is a good thing to see, Tuchman added.\n\n\u201cAll those barriers to entry that were really significant and kept this a very exclusive place, those days are over,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really great thing. Suddenly everyone\u2019s been invited to this party.\u201d\n\nTuchman has traded through a lot of market parties through the decades. He is known for iconic images taken of him on the NYSE trading floor, and his wild hairstyles and savvy ways garnered him the nickname \u201cEinstein of Wall Street,\u201d for valid reasons.\n\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes guarding the velvet ropes and being Mr. \u201cNo\u201d outside the door of Studio 54, owning a jazz record store, and working at a jazz club.\n\n\u201cMy approach to the market was different than your normal person analyzing the market,\u201d he said. Stock trader Peter Tuchman works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading on August 29, 2022, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he took a summer job as a teletypist on the exchange floor and eventually worked his way up to broker.\n\n\u201cThe energy, the adrenaline, for me, the minute I walked onto the floor, I knew this was for me,\u201d he reflected.\n\nTuchman\u2019s career overlapped with many significant down market events including Black Monday, 9/11, and the Great Recession. \u201cYou saw people losing futures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also saw the capacity and resilience of human beings in the workplace.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThis past week, there was plenty of resilience, energy, and adrenaline on hand as markets hit new highs.\n\nInvestors saw Nvidia rise to a $3.34 trillion market cap, making it briefly the most valuable company in the world, beating Apple at $3.29 trillion and Microsoft at $3.32 trillion before the stock lost ground.\n\nThis enthusiasm for Nvidia points to its sound position in artificial intelligence going forward \u2014 something for 40 million new investors to consider.\n\nDespite the market being hot, it's still important to do your homework and seek out value.

        "content": "Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock joined the S&P 500 index alongside the stocks of GoDaddy (NASDAQ:GDDY) and KKR (NYSE:KKR).\n\nCRWD stock rose sharply in pre-market trading this morning. Despite a slight dip around 11:00 a.m. Eastern, the shares have been mostly stable since the market opened. CRWD stock carries a price of $378 per share and a market capitalization of about $92 billion. Shares are up 53% so far in 2024 and nearly 490% since it came public about five years ago.\n\nBig Days for CyberCops\n\nCybersecurity has become a huge market over the last few years due to growing global tensions, the rise of criminal gangs, and the increased complexity of cloud-based computing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe total market was estimated to be worth $181 billion last year and is growing at 10% per year.\n\nCrowdstrike, based in Austin, is considered the leader in endpoint security within the cloud security market. It has about 18% of that $8.6 billion market despite competing directly with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is expanding into general cloud security.\n\nFor the quarter ending in May Crowdstrike earned $43 million, 18 cents per share fully diluted, on revenue of $921 million. The company is estimating full-year earnings will be about $4 per share on revenue of about $4 billion.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s lead product is Falcon Defender, which it says can detect a cyberattack on a client\u2019s infrastructure in just four minutes. Equivalent products using the same tests from Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) took 24 minutes to detect an attack. Crowdstrike also said its attack reports were more accurate than those of competitors.\n\nStocks entering the S&P 500 always get a boost as hedge funds trading the index are required to buy them. Shares of private equity firm KKR have gone up 11% since their inclusion was announced.\n\nCrowdstrike has recently benefited from Microsoft\u2019s bungled launch of its Recall feature. Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz has called Microsoft\u2019s statements on cybersecurity \u201clip service.\u201d\n\nCRWD Stock: What Happens Next?\n\nCybersecurity will remain a hot market but will also remain subject to disruption by new technology.

In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Stock Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst?\n\nNorthfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nDan Ives is highly bullish on the Redmond software company, saying on Twitter recently that he was seeing a \u201ctidal wave of Copilot and Azure monetization\u201d on the \u201cdoorstep\u201d of Microsoft. Ives also increased his price target on MSFT to $550 from $500.\n\nLast year, The Information reported that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) was working on its own AI chips under a project codenamed \u201cAthena,\u201d to cut its reliance on Nvidia. UBS said in its latest report that Athena chips, along with Azure, position Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to benefit from the opportunities in enabling layer in the AI value chain, while the firm named the company\u2019s OpenAI investment as an opportunity in the intelligence layer. Copilot, Office and GitHub will help Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) profit in the application layer of AI, UBS believes.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany Wall Street analysts are bullish on MSFT. New Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to occupy a strong position, poised to capture market share as businesses navigate the transition to a digital-first landscape and embrace generative AI-driven solutions. The company\u2019s commanding presence in the enterprise arena, combined with its comprehensive product portfolio encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), establishes it as a crucial provider of IT solutions for companies of all sizes.\n\nMicrosoft is effectively executing its strategy in a sizable market by offering a roadmap for digital transformation and adoption of AI-driven solutions, such as ChatGPT, while enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Consequently, we anticipate that Microsoft\u2019s solutions should exhibit resilience even in a more challenging macroeconomic environment, supporting low double-digit growth in intrinsic value within our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\n\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\n\nAlphabet's future position in AI\n\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\n\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\n\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\n\nFundamental and competitive analysis\n\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\n\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\n\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\n\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\n\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\n\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\n\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\n\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\n\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\n\nConclusion\n\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "2023 was a record year for ransomware attacks and the threat landscape has worsened this year. Bad actors have laid siege on government and enterprise systems, causing data leakages, financial losses and reputational damage. The only solutions to these threats are products offered by top cybersecurity stocks to buy now.\n\nAfter a series of high-profile attacks this year, the message is clear: companies and government agencies must prioritize cyber spending. Otherwise, they might face a sophisticated attack like the Change Healthcare attack that took several weeks to clean up.\n\nWith Chief Security Information Officers increasing their investments, the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now are poised for a secular bull run. Gartner forecast calls for security and risk management spending to rise 14% in 2024 and McKinsey sees a $2 trillion addressable market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith threats proliferating, cybersecurity spending will be on an upward trajectory. Moreover, growth in public cloud and remote work only heightens the need for cloud security and identity management tools. Under these conditions, these cybersecurity stocks to buy now will soar.\n\nOkta (OKTA) Okta, Inc. Logo seen on billboard. Okta (formerly Saasure Inc.) is an American identity and access management company based in San Francisco\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most common ways hackers access organization data is by compromising the identity of authorized users. Today, 80% of data breaches involve some form of compromised identity. To quell this threat, companies are seeking the best identity management solutions to fight this menace.\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA), which provides cyber solutions for user authentication and identity controls, will profit. Today, it is leading the fight against identity attacks. The company offers a unified identity solution that covers access management, privileged access and identity governance. Furthermore, it\u2019s rapidly bringing innovations like Identity Security Posture to market.\n\nDue to its multi-layered approach to identity security, Okta has emerged as one of the top solutions, beating competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This market advantage has led to stellar revenue growth. In the latest Q1 fiscal year 2025 report, total revenue increased 19% to $617 million and current remaining performance obligations grew by 15% to $1.9 billion.\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, Okta expects to achieve revenues of at least $2.53 billion, representing 12% growth. Still, with an $80 billion market opportunity, the identity management provider has a long growth runway.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy now, considering the secular tailwinds in cyber and its strong execution record. It\u2019s worth noting that it has grown free cash flow at a 30% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 10 years. As a result, the share price has compounded at a similar rate.\n\nThat said, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing for Fortinet recently. A report by Bleeping Computer revealed that an espionage attack by Chinese hackers on its cybersecurity system, FortiGate, was larger than previously indicated. This news has created an opportunity for long-term investors. At 30 times fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates, Fortinet is among the top cybersecurity stocks to buy now.\n\nIn terms of long-term fundamentals, Fortinet is well-positioned in its three growth pillars: network security, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Security Operations. It\u2019s the leader in network security with its firewall products and continues to gain market share. Management expects faster growth than the market\u2019s 10%.\n\nLastly, SASE will be a major growth engine as Fortinet leverages its 700,000 network security customers and 12 million deployed firewalls. Management plans to leverage this installed base to upsell and cross-sell SASE products.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cybersecurity giant has been consolidating between $260 and $325 since its Q2 fiscal year 2024 earnings in February. Investors have raised questions about its platformization strategy and its billings. However, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) remains one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now for the secular growth in cyber.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the bearish points. Palo Alto shifted to a platformization strategy to win market share. Although it has offered free use periods as trials, these customers end up signing more than three-year deals. On billings, the metric has slowed due to deferred payments caused by a high interest rate environment rather than lower demand.\n\nOn the bullish case, Palo Alto offers one of the best cybersecurity platforms. It enjoys product leadership in 23 categories organized into three platforms \u2013 network security, cloud security, and security ops. These platforms are tightly integrated into one solution. About 50% of the top 5,000 customers use two or more platforms, accounting for about 80% of next-generation security annual recurring revenue.\n\nIn addition to the best-in-class platform, the company has also improved margins significantly. In Q3 FY 2024, non-GAAP operating margins increased by 200 basis points YOY to 26%. Lastly, management expects at least 16% revenue growth and 38.5% adjusted free cash flow margins in FY2024. Indeed, this is a top cyber play with impressive growth and profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How to invest in AI as the rally continues",
        "content": "Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the AI rally. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to significantly influence equity market gains, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) contributing to 64% of the global equity market\u2019s growth in total return terms in the past 18 months.\n\nNotably, chipmaker Nvidia became the largest listed company globally in June. Additionally, 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies mentioned \u201cAI\u201d in their first-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet data. Here\u2019s how investors can seize the AI opportunity, according to UBS.\n\nNvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the split increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation, it does not change the company\u2019s overall value. \u201cSplitting the stock shouldn\u2019t create economic value in theory, but it will make the company more accessible to smaller investors,\u201d Morningstar technology equity strategist Brian Colello, explained.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said: \u201cAI looks set to remain a key driver of equity market returns. We see opportunities in the enabling layer of the AI value chain and in vertically integrated megacaps.\u201d\n\nSignificant investments are being directed towards AI, particularly at semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend approximately $200bn (\u00a3158bn) in the sector, a 35% increase over 2023, according to FactSet consensus. For this level of capital expenditure to be justified, AI use cases need to scale up significantly, UBS said.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nPotential applications span advertising, customer service, personal and coding assistants, R&D, cybersecurity, and more. However, AI-linked revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill AI justify the hype?\n\nUBS expects robust capital investment in AI to continue, driving strong earnings growth for companies within the enabling layer of the value chain. For instance, the Swiss bank expects earnings in the global semiconductor industry to rise by 50% this year and 25% in 2025. As the AI ecosystem expands, annual capital expenditure for the enabling layer could reach $331bn by 2027.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Apple, Bitcoin, Target and PepsiCo\n\nHowever, potential risks include the possibility of overcapacity in components like graphics processing units, custom chips, or memory if there\u2019s a lack of significant model advancements or consumer/business uptake.\n\nThe AI value chain: three critical layers\n\nTo understand AI\u2019s potential, UBS breaks down its value chain, comprising of three layers:\n\nEnabling Layer: Includes semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Intelligence Layer: Consists of large language models. Application Layer: Encompasses companies providing AI services for specific use cases, such as copilots and coding assistants.\n\nThe tech capex surge has primarily benefited the enabling layer. While fears of overcapacity could introduce volatility, this segment currently enjoys strong investment rates, offering a mix of attractive earnings growth profiles, competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway. UBS suggests focusing on semiconductor companies leading the AI infrastructure investments at data centres.\n\nMoreover, the AI investment landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major players.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\n\u201cOver time, we expect the AI market to be dominated by an oligopoly of vertically integrated \u201cfoundries\u201d and monolithic players along the value chain. So, alongside semiconductors, we also think investors should position in the oligopolies that are present across the entire technology stack, covering chips, cloud computing, and generative AI models and applications. We think these companies will be well positioned to navigate potential shifts in the competitive landscape in different parts of the value chain,\u201d UBS wrote in its CIO 2H outlook.\n\nAI rally: China or US?\n\nWhile the US has seen the greatest benefits from the AI rally, UBS notes that China's tech giants remain undervalued, trading at similar levels as before ChatGPT's launch. Despite challenges like tariffs, export controls, and local regulations, China\u2019s tech leaders are heavily investing in AI.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we expect China to develop an AI ecosystem that is distinct from that in much of the rest of the world. This should lead to significant monetisation potential for China\u2019s AI giants,\u201d UBS said.\n\nIs a company riskier than a country?\n\nThe market capitalisation of AI chipmaker Nvidia recently surpassed $3.3trn, more than double Switzerland\u2019s entire blue-chip stock index and significantly more than China\u2019s CSI 300. This raises questions about the risks of holding a single company versus a country-level index.\n\nWhile individual companies are generally more volatile, not participating in the returns these companies generate could pose a greater risk to investors\u2019 wealth over time, according to the Swiss bank.\n\nInvestors should seek quality growth\n\nFinally, UBS said investors should focus on global quality wealth compounders\u2014companies with a competitive edge, pricing power, and high barriers to entry. Such businesses, with a track record of disciplined capital allocation, strong balance sheets, and consistent profit growth, offer long-term sustainable value.\n\nQuality growth, often driven by structural growth themes like sustainable development, energy transition, and water scarcity, should be a core component of investors\u2019 equity holdings, UBS added.\n\nWatch: Nvidia will remain dominant for next 3-5 years: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\\\">NVDA</a>) has reached<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-became-3t-company-133118501.html\\\"> a $3 trillion market capitalization,</a> surpassing Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\\\">AAPL</a>) to become the second most valuable company in the US. The company's success has been propelled by the continued excitement around artificial intelligence. However, questions linger about the sustainability of this growth trajectory.</p>\\n<p>Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton joins the Morning Brief to share his perspective on Nvidia's soaring valuation.

        "content": "The S&P 500 dipped on Friday as shares of market darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell for the second consecutive day. The broad market index declined by 0.16%, closing at 5,464.62, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.18% to 17,689.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 15.57 points, or 0.04%, to end at 39,150.33.\n\nNvidia shares fell 3.2%, following a drop of over 3% on Thursday after hitting an all-time high. Despite this, the chipmaker remains up 155% year-to-date and briefly surpassed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable public company earlier in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 reached an intraday record of 5,505.53 earlier this week and posted a 0.6% weekly gain. The Nasdaq ended the week flat, while the Dow saw a 1.45% increase, marking its best weekly performance since May.\n\nThis week, the markets will largely be focused on important economic developments, most notably the durable goods report on Thursday, followed by the core PCE and University of Michigan reports on Friday. In addition, several Fed officials are scheduled to speak, including Governor Waller on Monday and New York Fed President Williams on Sunday.\n\nFor PCE data, economists at Goldman Sachs believe that personal income increased by 0.4% and personal spending grew by 0.26% in May.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that the core PCE price index rose +0.13%, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.59%,\u201d Goldman economists said in a note. \u201c Additionally, we expect that the headline PCE price index increased by 0.03% from the prior month, corresponding to a year-over-year rate of 2.51%.\u201d\n\nInvestors await Micron\u2019s earnings\n\nThe Q2 earnings season is nearing its end, though several significant reports are still yet to be released to close out the period.\n\nInvestors\u2019 attention will particularly be focused on the upcoming Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) print, an AI memory chipmaker whose shares surged more than 60% this year amid the ongoing bull market. Micron will report the results on Wednesday following the market\u2019s close.\n\nTwo other major reports that will be in the spotlight will be those by FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\nIn addition, companies like Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI), and McCormick&Company (NYSE:MKC) will also report this week.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nRBC Capital Markets: \u201cWe\u2019ve added a new stress test to our valuation analysis. This is an optimistic scenario which bakes in lower inflation, lower 10-year yields, and more Fed cuts than the current consensus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese assumptions imply that a reasonable trailing P/E for the S&P 500 at year-end would be around 22.5x and that a fair value for the index would be 5,500. That 5,500 index level is close to recent highs. While we consider our valuation model to be a compass, not a GPS, our work here nevertheless continues to make us worry that the US equity market has gotten a little ahead of itself in the short term due to a little too much optimism around interest rates and inflation after the latest CPI print/Fed meeting.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEvercore ISI: \u201cStocks are expensive and will remain so as S&P 500 is forecast to end the year at 6,000. But as the history of past \u201cexpensive markets\u201d illustrates, some of the strongest gains can occur once stocks become expensive.\n\n\u201cWhat makes each of the prior \u201cexpensive markets\u201d unique is their own trajectory with regard to time, price, earnings and breadth. Common to all, valuation alone is not sufficient to sell. 2024\u2019s \u201cexpensive\u201d market is driven by the promise of the AI Revolution, a Fed willing to cut interest rates for the \u201cright\u201d reasons, a period still relatively small in terms of duration and gains, the prospect of a return to earnings growth in 2024, and relatively robust breadth despite Mag 7 doing much of the lifting.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cWith macro data broadly coming in softer YTD, many lower quality and economically sensitive areas of the market have lagged, while a narrow list of higher quality mega caps have carried performance. In our view, this is a sign the market is becoming more focused on growth softening and less focused on inflation and rates. The underperformance of small caps despite falling rates is a good example of this phenomenon. This backdrop syncs with our long-standing view that the current policy mix of heavy fiscal and higher front end rates is effectively crowding out many economic participants.\u201d\n\nBTIG: \u201cLast week saw some of the biggest inflows on record into large-cap tech/growth funds. That feels like a sign of froth after the run we have had. We remain concerned about a near-term unwind of many YTD leaders. With that said, even within the 'Mag 7' we are seeing dispersion and charts like AMZN and GOOGL are still constructive and not overly stretched. If the SPX is going to avoid a bigger pullback into July, bulls need to see continued rotation below the surface.\u201d\n\nUBS: \u201cAs we have said over the past several months, we believe the market backdrop remains favorable due to: 1) solid and broadening profit growth, 2) disinflation, 3) a Fed pivoting to rate cuts, and 4) surging investment in AI infrastructure and applications. These trends have propelled the S&P 500 to a string of all-time highs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result of the healthy economic growth and surging investment in AI, we look for S&P 500 EPS to rise 11% in 2024 (to USD 250) and 6% in 2025 (to USD 265), which could prove to be conservative. Overall, we believe the environment remains supportive for US equities and investors should have a full allocation to the asset class. Our S&P 500 targets are 5,500 for year-end and 5,600 for June 2025.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nChina wants EU to scrap EV tariff plans as talks start\n\nExplainer-What next for Telecom Italia after network sale to KKR?\n\nView comments",

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 A suspected Chinese state-sponsored hacking group has stepped up its targeting of Taiwanese organizations, particularly those in sectors such as government, education, technology and diplomacy, according to cybersecurity intelligence company Recorded Future.\n\nIn recent years, relations between China and Taiwan, a self-governed island across the Taiwan Strait that Beijing claims as its territory, have deteriorated. The cyberattacks by the group known as RedJulliett were observed between November 2023 and April 2024, during the lead up to Taiwan's presidential elections in January and the subsequent change in administration.\n\nRedJuliett has targeted Taiwanese organizations in the past, but this is the first time that activity was seen at such a scale, a Recorded Future analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns.\n\nThe report said RedJuliett attacked 24 organizations, including government agencies in places like Laos, Kenya and Rwanda, as well as Taiwan.\n\nIt also hacked into websites of religious organizations in Hong Kong and South Korea, a U.S university and a Djiboutian university. The report did not identify the organizations.\n\nRecorded Future said RedJuliett accessed the servers of those places via a vulnerability in their SoftEther enterprise virtual private network (VPN) software, an open-source VPN that allows remote connections to an organization\u2019s networks.\n\nRedJuliett has been observed attempting to break into systems of more than 70 Taiwanese organizations including three universities, an optoelectronics company and a facial recognition company that has contracts with the government.\n\nIt was unclear if RedJuliett managed to break into those organizations: Recorded Future only said it observed the attempts to identify vulnerabilities in their networks.\n\nRedJuliett's hacking patterns match those of Chinese state-sponsored groups, according to Recorded Future.\n\nIt said that based on the geolocations of IP addresses, RedJulliett is likely based out of the city of Fuzhou, in China\u2019s southern Fujian province, whose coast faces Taiwan.\n\n\u201cGiven the close geographical proximity between Fuzhou and Taiwan, Chinese intelligence services operating in Fuzhou are likely tasked with intelligence collection against Taiwanese targets,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cRedJuliett is likely targeting Taiwan to collect intelligence and support Beijing\u2019s policy-making on cross-strait relations,\u201d the Recorded Future report said.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately comment.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft reported in August last year that RedJuliett, which Microsoft tracks under the name Flax Typhoon, was targeting Taiwanese organizations.\n\nChina has in recent years stepped up military drills around Taiwan and imposed economic and diplomatic pressure on the island.\n\nRelations between Taiwan and Beijing worsened further after the election in January of Taiwan's new president Lai Ching-te, who China has deemed a \u201cseparatist,\" after he said in his inauguration speech that Taiwan and China were not subordinate to each other. Like his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has said that there is no need to declare Taiwanese independence because it is already an independent sovereign state.\n\nLike many other countries including the U.S., China has been known to engage in cyberespionage. Earlier this year, the U.S. and Britain accused China of a sweeping cyberespionage campaign that allegedly hit millions of people.\n\nBeijing has consistently denied engaging in any form of state-sponsored hacking, instead saying that China itself is a major target of cyberattacks.\n\nAccording to Recorded Future, Chinese state-sponsored groups will likely continue to target Taiwanese government agencies, universities and critical technology companies via \u201cpublic-facing\u201d devices such as open-source VPN software, which provide limited visibility and logging capabilities.\n\nCompanies and organizations can best protect themselves by prioritizing and patching vulnerabilities once they become known, Recorded Future\u2019s threat intelligence analyst said.\n\n___\n\nLink to the report: : https://www.recordedfuture.com/redjuliett-intensifies-taiwanese-cyber-espionage-via-network-perimeter\n\nView comments",
