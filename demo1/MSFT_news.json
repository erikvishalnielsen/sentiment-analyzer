        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\n\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\n\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Stock to Buy Based on New AI ETF?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest holding of the KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), accounting for about 8.6% of the total assets.\n\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d with its \u201cCopilot strategy\u201d for the back half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet earnings top estimates as cloud business gains steam, AI losses grow",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) reported its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, as its cloud businesses continue to pick up steam, topping the $1 billion mark for operating profit for the first time.\n\nFor the quarter, the company saw earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.7 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's a jump from the same period last year of 31% and 14%, respectively, when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nAdvertising revenue topped $64.6 billion versus analysts' expectations of $64.5 billion, and up from $58.1 billion last year. YouTube ad revenue, however, fell short, with the segment bringing in $8.66 billion versus expectations of $8.95 billion.\n\nShares of Alphabet were flat immediately following the announcement.\n\nGoogle saw cloud revenue of $10.35 billion and operating income of $1.17 billion. That's better than analyst expectations of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million, and higher than the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. When exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google\u2019s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\n\u201cIt is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note ahead of Alphabet's earnings announcement.\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren\u2019t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it spends on AI, Alphabet has been cutting in other areas including headcount. In Q2, the company reported having 179,582 employees, down from 181,798 in the same period last year. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Investing.com - Jefferies released a research note on Tuesday, highlighting the need for tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to accelerate its software momentum.\n\nDespite IBM 's outperformance of the IGV (iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF) by 7% YTD, Jefferies believes that the company's stock is likely to remain range-bound, with modest growth in the 3-4% range.\n\nThe three key areas analysts are monitoring include software growth, consulting, and AI contribution. The firm anticipates challenges in software growth due to tougher comparisons, and in consulting, which missed revenue expectations and saw a lowered guidance in the first quarter.\n\nFurthermore, Jefferies does not expect AI to make a significant contribution to the software sector this year.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIBM, often referred to as 'Big Blue', is seen as a slow-moving entity, with Wall Street predicting just 1% total revenue growth in 2Q and a 15% free cash flow (FCF) margin. The sluggish growth expectations are largely due to the consulting segment, where other industry players such as Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ:CTSH), and Infosys (NYSE:INFY) have reported ongoing uncertainty over discretionary spending projects.\n\nSoftware growth is projected to be 2.5% year-on-year, almost three times the overall revenue growth in 2Q. As IBM transitions towards a software-led model, the company's software performance is considered crucial for driving more substantial bottom-line growth. Software accounted for 40% of total revenue but approximately two-thirds of pre-tax income in CY23.\n\nIn 2Q, the software business is expected to contribute the majority of overall growth, as well as in FY24. The consensus estimate for software revenue in 2Q is $6.5 billion, representing a 2.5% year-on-year growth.\n\nJefferies emphasized the importance of strong execution in the Red Hat business and the successful integration of HCP for achieving sustainable software growth.\n\nThe consulting business growth expectations are relatively muted due to weaker near-term demand. However, Jefferies believes that AI will significantly benefit the consulting sector in the short term, with IBM recording over $1 billion of AI bookings over the last three quarters, primarily weighted towards consulting.\n\nAnalysts deemed the risk/reward as balanced, with IBM shares trading at 20 times CY25E EPS, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 32 times and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 28 times.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies maintained their 'Hold' rating for IBM with a price target of $190.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJefferies analysis: IBM's future growth hinges on software momentum\n\nAfter-hours movers: Alphabet, Tesla, Texas Instruments, Seagate and more\n\nEnphase Energy's revenue reached $303.5 million\n\nView comments()",

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nFactors Shaping Upcoming Results\n\nMicrosoft's performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to have shown robust growth, primarily driven by its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite, is likely to have contributed significantly to top-line growth.\r\n\r\nIn the Intelligent Cloud segment, the company anticipates revenues between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. Our model estimate for this segment is pegged at $28.54 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth in the range of 30-31% at cc. Microsoft's Azure platform is spearheading the company's AI-driven growth strategy.\r\n\r\nA key factor in Microsoft's growth strategy has been Teams, its enterprise communication platform. Teams has been expanding its customer base and feature set, effectively competing against rivals like Zoom. The platform's growth is closely tied to the rising popularity of hybrid and flexible work models. \r\n\r\nIn the quarter under review, Microsoft announced that it is set to sell Teams separately from its Office product globally. The decision comes after the company unbundled the two products in Europe to avert a possible EU antitrust fine.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft anticipates its Productivity and Business Processes segment to generate revenues between $19.9 billion and $20.2 billion. Our model estimate is pegged at $20.03 billion, indicating an increase of 9.5% year over year.\r\n\r\nThis growth is underpinned by strong performance across various product lines. Office 365 Commercial is expected to see revenue growth of approximately 14% at constant currency (cc), which is in line with our model estimate. However, traditional Office Commercial products are projected to experience a decline in the mid-to-high teens range, highlighting the ongoing shift from on-premise to cloud-based solutions.\r\n\r\nThe company's diversified portfolio continues to show promise, with Office Consumer products and cloud services expected to achieve revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits. LinkedIn is projected to achieve mid-to-high single-digit growth. Our model estimate for LinkedIn is pegged at revenue growth of 6.6%.\r\n\r\nDynamics 365, Microsoft's enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management platform, is another steady performer, with the company projecting revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. \r\n\r\nFor the More Personal Computing segment, the company projects revenues between $15.2 billion and $15.6 billion. Revenues from Windows are likely to have been driven by steady traction seen in Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth amid improving personal computer (PC) demand.\r\n\r\nThe Traditional PC market delivered its second quarter of growth following eight consecutive quarters of decline. According to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker, worldwide shipments reached 64.9 million units in the second quarter of 2024, representing year-over-year growth of 3%.\r\n\r\nAmong other major PC vendors, Lenovo (LNVGY) and Hewlett Packard (HPE) registered an increase in shipments. Lenovo's shipments increased 3.7% year over year to 14.7 million units, while HPE's shipments grew 1.8% year over year to 13.7 million units. Additionally, Apple (AAPL) registered a 20.8% year-over-year improvement in shipments, reaching 5.7 million units.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects Windows OEM revenues to grow in the mid to low-to-mid single-digit range. In the Gaming segment, MSFT expects revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Furthermore, Microsoft anticipates Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s, driven by roughly 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced the renewal of a publishing agreement with NetEase, which will bring back Blizzard Entertainment's games like World of Warcraft to players in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nShares of MSFT have returned 17.8% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 21.5%. Shares of HPE and AAPL have gained 21.3% and 16.3%, respectively, while shares of LNVGY have declined 2.8%.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value Microsoft offers investors at current levels. MSFT is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 11.73X compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s 8.13X and higher than the median of 10.05X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nMSFT\u2019s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nMicrosoft presents a strong investment case with its dominant position in cloud computing (Azure) and productivity software (Office 365), driving consistent revenue growth. The company's strategic focus on AI integration and partnerships, like with OpenAI, positions it at the forefront of technological innovation. Microsoft's diversified portfolio, including gaming (Xbox) and professional networking (LinkedIn), provides stability and multiple growth avenues.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, potential challenges include intense competition in the cloud market, particularly from Amazon and Google, and the cyclical nature of enterprise IT spending. Regulatory scrutiny over market dominance and data privacy concerns pose additional risks. Despite these challenges, Microsoft's strong balance sheet, consistent cash flow, and history of shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks make it an attractive option for investors seeking a balance of growth and stability in the tech sector.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicrosoft's strong performance in productivity and collaboration offerings is expected to drive substantial growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 despite a premium valuation and fierce competition in the cloud market. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, AI integration, and innovative product development has positioned it favorably in the competitive market. Maintaining a position in Microsoft appears prudent at present. Investors looking to buy the stock should, however, wait for a better entry point.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Buy Mag 7 Weakness?",
        "content": "Several Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\n\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks\u2019 runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Reaccelerates\n\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\n\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company\u2019s cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms Enjoys Profitability Boost\n\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\n\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It\u2019s worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META\u2019s revenue.\n\nIn addition, META shares aren\u2019t expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company\u2019s outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\n\nNvidia Outlook Remains Robust\n\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\n\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\n\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\n\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPutting Everything Together\n\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks \u2013 Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\n\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\n\nNonetheless, these stocks\u2019 runs certainly aren\u2019t over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Cautious Optimism for Alibaba",
        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) has reported a mix of performance outcomes for fiscal year 2024. While the company's international commerce segment, under the Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) division, has shown remarkable growth, it continues to face challenges within its core markets.\n\nDespite these challenges, Alibaba retains durable competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its leadership in mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics. The company's strategic investments in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers are promising, though their success is not guaranteed given the challenging macroeconomic environment and execution risks.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BABA.\n\nIn the near term, the stock is likely to remain volatile, reflecting the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if Alibaba can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, shares could potentially return over 30% within 12 months, according to analyst forecasts.\n\nAlibaba's path to growth: International success\n\nAlibaba posted 7% year-over-year revenue growth for the March quarter, but income from operations fell by 3%. Overall net income climbed for the entire 2024 fiscal year by 9%, but results have had to be more consistent recently.\n\nIndeed, it does not feel like stiff competition dented Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce operations. Its international retail division posted solid momentum driven by robust order growth on platforms such as AliExpress. Other initiatives, such as the AliExpress Choice initiative, further boosted performance, which improved the customer experience with better product selection. Cautious Optimism for Alibaba\n\nSource: Alibaba\n\nIn the wholesale space, Alibaba has enjoyed the benefit of delivering value-added services across borders. The Chinese wholesale commerce area is expanding. International commerce net revenues shifted back and forth for the group at $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected staggering year-over-year growth of 45%, which says a lot about the strong momentum of the company's international businesses recently.\n\nAs a final point, the company has increased its focus on the growth of its AliExpress platform through logistic integration with its Cainiao network. Alibaba aims to increase AliExpress' brand awareness and user experience globally by increasing investments in key markets across Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nA $5 billion buyback plan: A bold move amid investor concerns and market challenges\n\nIn May, Alibaba announced plans to raise $5 billion through a convertible bond offering. The company said proceeds would fund share buybacks at $80.80 per share. This suggests management sees value in repurchasing stock at current levels.\n\nHowever, some investors needed clarification on the deal's complex structure. There are also worries over how accessible the new cash on Alibaba's balance sheet will be for general corporate purposes.\n\nAnalysts see the potential for the stock to increase in value, but point to risks that limit the upside or lead to further declines. For instance, Hargreaves Lansdown notes some \"green shoots\" of improvement in Alibaba's business, but progress overall remains sluggish.\n\nSimilarly, Morningstar recently raised its price target for Alibaba by 2% to $96 per share, implying undervaluation. This target is based on expectations that consumer discretionary spending in China will rebound, allowing the company to regain market share and resume earnings growth. However, competition and regulatory hurdles remain top concerns.\n\nThe road ahead: Opportunities abound amid economic and competitive hurdles\n\nWhile Alibaba has promising opportunities in areas like international expansion and artificial intelligence, the company faces an uphill battle with numerous challenges impacting its business.\n\nThe country's gross domestic product growth has slowed to an estimated 3% to 4% annually from the 6% to 7% in earlier years. This slowdown, together with the impacts of Covid-19, weakened consumers' confidence and theatrically trimmed discretionary spending. Less demand among consumers is the last thing a company with a heavy dependence on Chinese retail, like Alibaba, would be concerned with.\n\nTogether with macroeconomic concerns, Alibaba is being competitively squeezed by some business lines. Within Chinese e-commerce, Alibaba has been losing market share to JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings' (NASDAQ:PDD) Pinduoduo. The company's operations in this segment are growing only at single-digit rates year over yearpretty slow compared to the hypergrowth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses have attained.\n\nAlibaba Cloud faces uphill competition from dominant players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. These Western tech giants have far greater global brand recognition and trust than Alibaba Cloud.\n\nBetween economic struggles and fierce competition, there are legitimate concerns about Alibaba's ability to execute its growth strategy. The company's core commerce segment makes up most of the total revenue, so any deeper slowdown here would be very impactful.\n\nAlibaba is trying to expand into new frontiers in China and abroad, but execution risks are elevated given the challenging macro environment. More specifically, the Chinese retail landscape looks particularly challenging in the near term. Given economic uncertainties, consumer discretionary spending remains under pressure. This weighs heavily on Alibaba's massive e-commerce platforms like Taobao and Tmall, which rely on Chinese consumers' willingness to shop.\n\nOnly when broader consumer confidence rebounds will it be easier for the stock to recapture previous highs. Markets will watch closely for signs of stabilization in China's commerce trends. But the environment is likely to remain cloudy in the short term.\n\nThe takeaway: Cautious optimism\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still reasons for optimism if investors take a long-term view. While the stock has struggled recently, Alibaba retains competitive strengths in Chinese e-commerce through its mobile payments, social commerce and consumer logistics leadership. As China's economy expands over time, Alibaba is poised to benefit.\n\nThe company also has promising initiatives in emerging segments like cross-border commerce, cloud computing and customer management software for retailers. Significant investments in these areas could potentially pay off.\n\nHowever, Alibaba's growth trajectory remains unclear. Much depends on how successfully the company can execute new growth drivers while shoring up its core Chinese e-commerce operations. Investors need more evidence these investments will translate into profits.\n\nIn the near term, Alibaba's stock will likely remain volatile. The valuation reflects the growth struggles witnessed recently. However, if the company can demonstrate consistent market share gains in China while resuming steady earnings growth, its valuation multiple may expand again.\n\nAccording to analyst forecasts, the stock could potentially return over 30% within 12 months for investors with a higher risk tolerance. However, ongoing economic and regulatory headwinds in China make this a far from sure bet.\n\nUntil China's business climate stabilizes, investors may want to approach the stock cautiously. Consider waiting for clarity on Alibaba's growth rebound before making major positions, but keep it on your watchlist for when Chinese consumption trends improve.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Marjorie Taylor Greene Loves AI Stocks. Here Are 5 She Bought in the First Half of 2024.",
        "content": "It's not only their politicking that draws interest these days. With politicians demonstrating a remarkable ability to outperform the market, investors are increasingly interested in the stock picks of senators and representatives. Take the Peach State representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, who has been an avid buyer of stocks so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in particular that seem to be the focus of Greene's interest in the first half of 2024. In addition to AdvancedMicroDevices(NASDAQ: AMD), Greene also picked up shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM).\n\nGreene gained broad exposure to the AI industry\n\nStarting her 2024 stock purchases in April, Greene bought shares of both Qualcomm and Microsoft. Although the exact value of the transactions isn't known, Greene reported in regulatory filings that each transaction was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Both buys provided Greene with notable -- yet diverse -- exposure to the rapidly burgeoning AI industry.\n\nA leading semiconductor manufacturer, Qualcomm is targeting generative AI applications for mobile devices with its Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Mobile platform. In addition, its providing AI functionality to personal computers with its Snapdragon X Elite Platform and automobiles with Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Focused on software, Microsoft's commitment to offering sophisticated AI solutions is demonstrated with Copilot -- an AI tool that is available across Microsoft's suite of products from Word and Excel to Designer, where users can create unique images with DALL-E 3.\n\nThe following month, Greene broadened her AI exposure with positions in Apple and Advanced Micro Devices in two transactions that were each valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Making a concerted effort to offer more AI capability, Apple has been working on its own large language model (LLM), dubbed Ajax. In early June, moreover, Apple revealed Apple Intelligence. Available on its various devices, Apple states that Apple Intelligence \"combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that's incredibly useful and relevant.\"\n\nLike Qualcomm, AMD also produces the hardware that's powering AI. In addition to its MI300 accelerators (specialized microprocessors) that are designed for generative AI and large language models, AMD manufactures Ryzen PRO 8000 processors, which the company characterizes as \"the first processors with dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators for commercial desktop [personal computers].\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late June, Greene clicked the \"buy\" button on cybersecurity specialist CrowdStrike. Powered with AI, CrowdStrike helps clients protect a variety of devices including laptops, mobile devices, and those connected on the Internet of Things. In addition, CrowdStrike has developed a generative AI security tool, Charlotte AI, that integrates with various aspects of the company's Falcon platform.\n\nYou may be green with envy over Greene's picks, but that doesn't mean you should buy these AI stocks too\n\nWhile following politicians' stock picks is a smart strategy, blindly mimicking their buys is foolhardy at best. It's important for individual investors to do their due diligence and evaluate whether the stocks in question are smart choices for them. That being said, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Apple, and AMD are all industry leaders that are trading at premiums to their historical valuations.\n\nTherefore, value investors may want to keep these names on their watch lists instead of rushing to add them to their portfolios. Of course valuation isn't the only factor that investors should consider, so long-term investors may not want to investigate these tickers further before deciding to watch them from the side of the road.\n\nCrowdStrike, however, is in a different boat since it caused a global outage last week. With the sell-off that followed news of the global outage, CrowdStrike's stock is a lot less expensive today, giving back most of its 2024 gains. Inauspicious as the news may be for CrowdStrike, it's critical for investors to remember that this event, in and of itself, doesn't spell doom for the company.\n\nComputer code is complicated, and the flaw that was in the company's update is unfortunate but not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company. For those with the resolve to weather some near-term volatility, CrowdStrike may be a great addition for investors looking for a leading cybersecurity stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Just last Wednesday, I posted a column reporting how our richest corporations, through sheer miserliness and profit-seeking, left millions of Americans vulnerable to technological attacks on their privacy and welfare.\n\nI failed to raise one important question: What if the attacks come from inside the house?\n\nThat's exactly what happened Friday. An ineptly designed update to a program rolled out by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike and installed automatically on users' machines instantly crashed millions of computers running Microsoft programs and left them disabled until manual fixes could be undertaken. Some haven't been fixed yet.\n\nCrowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control.\n\nBusiness blogger Ed Zitron\n\nThe fallout reached worldwide and affected people across the modern technological landscape. Thousands of flights were canceled. Doctors couldn't perform surgeries. Banking transactions were frozen. Emergency 911 lines went silent.\n\nThe affected computers displayed what Microsoft Windows users know as the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" Typically, this is a baby-blue screen bearing the message that Microsoft's operating system hadn't loaded correctly and the machine should be restarted.\n\nThat didn't work this time: The errant CrowdStrike application was burrowed so deep within the Microsoft operating system \u2014 as it's designed to be \u2014 that every time a machine restarted, it ran into the same glitch and went dead again in an infinite doom loop.\n\nThe CrowdStrike program \u2014 irony of ironies \u2014 is an anti-hacking application that identifies hacking attempts and fights them off. In the cat-and-mouse game pitting computer users against hackers, such applications have to be updated regularly. They reside in the bowels of the operating system, because in order to be effective, they have to load before almost any other function.\n\nIn this case, a coding error in the update delivered an order to the operating system that caused the system to shut down.\n\nThat's a simplified explanation of what happened. Now let's look at the lessons this episode teaches us \u2014 if we're willing to learn them.\n\nThey have to do with our complacency about our dependence on digital systems, including those distributed by developers we've never heard of (CrowdStrike, for instance).\n\nWhat few people are aware of as they go about their lives is how much crucial digital infrastructure is based on Microsoft programs and applications, and how much of those are supplemented by third-party programs and applications.\n\nAll of this must work together to work smoothly \u2014 or to appear to work smoothly. Here and there something goes wrong, but its ramifications are sufficiently constrained that it can be rectified quickly, and even invisibly.\n\nRead more:Column: After a years-long pause, the FCC resurrects 'network neutrality,' a boon for consumers\n\nA great deal of it, furthermore, is automated; it's designed to run with a minimum of human intervention. In the view of the IT departments that are expected to monitor all this, humans are perpetual money pits \u2014 they need days off, get sick, demand raises, quit and must be replaced by newbies needing training, etc., etc. By comparison, machines look like a one-time capital expense \u2014 set it and forget it, is the goal.\n\nMicrosoft is the hub of these networks because Microsoft made them its business. It created an open architecture for third-party developers to piggyback on; the fundamental idea was that by extending the system's capabilities, those other developers made Microsoft's central system more valuable. Microsoft either outsourced some functions to independent developers, or allowed them to design applications that competed with Microsoft's versions \u2014 but those still were designed to work with Microsoft operability.\n\nAmong those developers is Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike, one of countless firms offering cybersecurity services to Windows users. (Microsoft's own cybersecurity suite is known as Defender.)\n\nApple computers and devices don't have the same vulnerabilities because that company does almost all its extensions in-house, and keeps a very close eye on what it allows to interact with its software and hardware; the company doesn't allow outside applications to interact with its operating system at the fundamental level available with Microsoft's systems.\n\nBut Apple doesn't have anywhere near as large a footprint in enterprise services as Microsoft. A report issued in March by the government's Cyber Safety Review Board about a major hacking intrusion into Microsoft's cloud system in March 2023 asserted that the company's \"ubiquitous and critical products ... underpin essential services that support national security, the foundations of our economy, and public health and safety.\"\n\nAnyone living in the modern world has to confront the drawbacks of our reliance on digital technology on almost a daily basis. In prehistoric days, back when our household appliances were mechanical or electric, not electronic, a breakdown was easy to diagnose and fix \u2014 switch out a tube or tighten a screw.\n\nWhen a device ceases to function today, it's often impossible to pinpoint the fault \u2014 did my TV go bad, or did the internet go down, or was it just the channel I was watching?\n\nRead more:Column: 60 years ago in Los Angeles, piano virtuoso Glenn Gould revolutionized the music industry by ending his concert career\n\nYet many of us rely on a single company for multiple services. For example, I get my home phone service, broadband internet, and television/video (broadcast and cable channels and streaming) from a single provider. I don't have much choice, since for most of these it's the only provider in my neighborhood. But when it goes down, everything goes down.\n\nThat provider, Spectrum, has tried to sell me on its mobile phone service too. I've refused, because I figure I need at least one thread of access to the outside world that isn't dependent on its all-in-one monopoly.\n\nMicrosoft's near-dominance of cloud computing \u2014 the ecosystem through which all those enterprise computers that went dead last week communicate with each other and with the outside world \u2014 should make all of us queasy, because the company's cybersafety record is atrocious.\n\nThe Cyber Safety Review Board investigation concluded that the March 2023 hack occurred because \"Microsoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light of the company\u2019s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of trust customers place in the company to protect their data and operations.\"\n\nThe board mentioned, among other things, a \"cascade of ... avoidable errors\" in the company's cybersecurity program, its failure to detect the compromise by hackers of its own \"cryptographic crown jewels\"\u2014it acted only the U.S. State Department discovered the incursion and alerted Microsoft.\n\nThe board found that Microsoft's security practices were inferior to those of \"other cloud service providers.\" The report mentioned Amazon, Google and Oracle as Microsoft rivals in cloud services with better security systems.\n\nMicrosoft pledged to \"adopt a new culture of engineering security in our own networks\" and said it had \"mobilized our engineering teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes, and enforce security benchmarks.\"\n\nThe CrowdStrike crash suggests that those efforts are still works in progress. It's fair to say that much of the blame for the outage belongs to CrowdStrike, which allowed an update to a crucial application to be sent to users for automatic installation without doing the testing necessary to ensure that the update was operationally bulletproof.\n\nTechnology blogger Ed Zitron properly tied the disaster to the financialization of Big Business generally, in which pumping ever higher profits to shareholders becomes a higher priority than ensuring that one's products meet quality standards.\n\n\"Crowdstrike seemingly borrowed Boeing\u2019s approach to quality control,\" Zitron wrote, \"except instead of building planes where the doors fly off at the most inopportune times (specifically, when you\u2019re cruising at 35,000ft), it released a piece of software that blew up the transportation and banking sectors, to name just a few.\"\n\nRead more:Column: Excited about AI and self-driving cars? A top roboticist is here to burst your bubble\n\nCrowdStrike Chief Executive George Kurtz moved promptly to \"sincerely apologize\" to all affected users, via a statement and an appearance on the NBC \"Today\" show. \"We quickly identified the issue and deployed a fix, allowing us to focus diligently on restoring customer systems as our highest priority,\" Kurtz said in a posting on the company's website.\n\nMicrosoft placed the blame chiefly on CrowdStrike. \"Although this was not a Microsoft incident, given it impacts our ecosystem, we want to provide an update on the steps we\u2019ve taken with CrowdStrike and others to remediate and support our customers,\" David Weston, a vice president for enterprise and security, wrote on the company's website.\n\nBut Microsoft, plainly, failed to take on board the necessity of vetting every piece of third-party software that could have an effect on its own customers \u2014 before it blew up their computer systems.\n\nNo software system is immune from errors, especially now that they're so complex and multilayered that not even their developers may know all their weak spots. (An error at Amazon's cloud service incapacitated as many as 150,000 websites for several hours in February 2017 \u2014 a major problem, but not nearly on the scale of the CrowdStrike crash.)\n\nBut as these systems play an ever-expanding role in modern life even as they become more complex, it's incumbent on their providers to make security and safety their top priorities, not merely mouth the concept in marketing material without actually taking it seriously.\n\nCloud clients also need to pay more attention to what is getting automatically inserted into their systems. Who has the right to gloat over escaping the CrowdStrike meltdown last week? Amusingly, it's Southwest Airlines. For decades, Southwest resisted Microsoft's urgings that it upgrade its systems to the latest versions of Windows, relying on Windows 3.1, which is 32 years old \u2014 so antique that the CrowdStrike update wouldn't even work on the airline's systems.\n\nSo while affected carriers such as Delta, United and American had canceled nearly 2,400 flights by 6 p.m. Friday, Southwest had canceled three. (By midday Monday, the number of canceled flights reached beyond 12,300.) That doesn't mean that Southwest gets everything right. After all, the airline suffered more than its competitors from the ferocious storm in December 2022 that snarled air traffic nationwide \u2014 precisely because it had not paid enough attention to keeping its computer systems updated.\n\nIn this case, however, Southwest's cheapskate culture was its savior. That may only put it on the same level as the proverbial blind squirrel that occasionally finds a nut. But it shows that all of our Big Business squirrels need to keep their eyes open, and focused on the perils of inattention.\n\nGet the latest from Michael Hiltzik\r\nCommentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.\r\nSign me up.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 50% of His $46 Billion Trust Invested in 2 Brilliant Stocks",
        "content": "The Bill and Melinda Gates (BMG) Foundation is one of the largest charitable organizations in the world. As of December 2023, it had issued grants totaling nearly $78 billion to help alleviate poverty, improve health, support education, and combat inequities around the world.\n\nThat charitable giving is funded by the BMG Foundation Trust, which manages money donated by Bill Gates, Melinda French, and Warren Buffett. Investors should keep the trust on their radar because it returned 47% during the three-year period that ended in March 2024, while the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned just 32%.\n\nThe BMG Foundation Trust had 50% of its $46 billion portfolio spread across two stocks as of March: 34% in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and 16% in Waste Management(NYSE: WM). Those have been brilliant investments, almost doubling the gains in the S&P 500 over the last three years. And Bill Gates clearly has confidence in their future.\n\nMicrosoft: 34% asset allocation\n\nMicrosoft is the largest software vendor and second-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS) provider. The company accounted for 16.8% of cloud spending in 2023 when infrastructure, platform, and software services are considered collectively, up from 16.5% in 2022. The next closest competitor was Amazon Web Services, with 12.4% market share, according to research from IDC.\n\nMicrosoft's dominance in software comes from its business-productivity and enterprise resource-planning platforms Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, respectively. The company has created new monetization opportunities in both ecosystems with generative artificial intelligence (AI) copilots. The IDC recently recognized Microsoft as a leader in conversational AI software.\n\nMicrosoft Azure's strength in CIPS comes from its data base, cybersecurity, and hybrid cloud products, as well as AI and machine learning services. A recent survey from Morgan Stanley identified Azure as the CIPS provider most likely to gain market share in the coming years. \"The company's leadership in the shift to the public cloud is now being compounded by an early leadership positioning in generative AI,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent note.\n\nMicrosoft reported good financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 2024). Revenue rose 17% to $61.9 billion, and earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) jumped 20% to $2.94 per diluted share. Those strong numbers were driven by momentum in enterprise software and cloud services, fueled in part by demand for AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street currently expects the company to grow earnings by 14% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 38.3 times earnings look fairly expensive, but not absurdly so. Investors eager to own Microsoft stock can start with a small position today, but they should aim to make future purchases at less expensive valuations.\n\nWaste Management: 16% asset allocation\n\nWaste Management is the largest provider of waste collection and disposal services in North America as measured by revenue. The company controls 28% of U.S. landfill volume, while its closest competitor controls 20%.\n\nBrian Bernard at Morningstar says its vast network of transfer stations and landfills has historically supported pricing power, and he believes that this economic moat is \"nearly impossible to replicate given immense regulatory hurdles.\"\n\nMore broadly, investors should appreciate Waste Management because it provides essential services, meaning demand should persist to some degree through economic ups and downs. That defensive quality has made it more resilient than the average S&P 500 company during stock market downturns.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, Waste Management has outperformed the S&P 500 by an average of 10 percentage points during bear markets since 2000.\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Waste Management Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (33%) October 2007 (57%) (43%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (17%) Average (41%) (31%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nWaste Management reported mixed results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 5.5% to $5.2 billion, falling short of the 6.7% sales growth Wall Street anticipated. But GAAP earnings still jumped 35% to $1.75 per diluted share, easily beating the 15% growth forecast by analysts.\n\nThe waste management sector is expected to grow at 5.4% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research. Wall Street expects Waste Management to grow earnings per share by 12% annually over the next three to five years. That estimate makes the current valuation of 36.5 times earnings look rather expensive, especially when the three-year average is 33 times earnings. Personally, I would avoid this stock until it trades at a discount to its average price-to-earnings multiple over the last three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Got $5,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "The technology sector has helped lead the market higher not only this year but really for the past decade. This can be seen in the performance of an index such as the Dow Jones Technology Index, which is up over 27% year to date and has generated an average annual return of 20% over the past 10 years.\n\nAs such, the tech sector is certainly not only for traders, but also for long-term buy and hold investors. Let's look at two tech stocks that investors can buy and hold for the long term.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nOnce considered to be a stodgy, old-fashioned tech company, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has repositioned itself to become one of the top tech companies leading the charge in artificial intelligence (AI). In fact, the company's ability to be able to reinvent itself over the years is one reason why it is a great stock to buy and hold.\n\nMicrosoft's first big move showing its ability to adapt to the times was shifting from a one-time purchase model to a subscription model, with the introduction of Microsoft 365 starting back in 2013. The gradual nature with which the company did this proved to be a strong growth driver while not alienating its customer base.\n\nMore recently, Microsoft has shown itself to be at the forefront of AI, making an early investment in OpenAI and then later substantially increasing that investment and partnering with the company to incorporate its technology throughout its various product offers. Thus far, the company's Azure cloud computing segment has been a big beneficiary of this early move, as customers clamored to build out their AI applications with the help of Azure. Given Azure's consumption-based model, where customers pay for what they need, this has led to strong growth for Azure and the business taking share from competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has also shown a willingness to take big swings with acquisitions over the years, including with LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard. GitHub has been a strong performer for for the company, and it too has been a nice beneficiary of AI, with the introduction of GitHub AI assistant copilots to the developer platform helping drive 45% growth for the platform in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile not currently on many investors' radars when looking at Microsoft, it will be interesting to see what the company does with AI when it comes to Xbox and Activision Blizzard when it releases its next video gaming console in a few years. There could be a lot of growth in store in a few years, given the potential advancement AI will have in gaming.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 33 times and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of under 0.9 times, the stock looks attractively priced, given its long-term growth potential and its monopoly-like dominance in the worker productivity (Word, Excel, etc.) and PC operating system (Windows) spaces.\n\nStory continues MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nSimilar to Microsoft, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a monopoly-like dominant market position, but instead of worker productivity tools, it is winning with Google search, which has an estimated over 90% global market share. Like Microsoft, Alphabet's cloud computing segment is nicely benefiting from the AI boom.\n\nThe similarities with Microsoft don't end there, as Alphabet has also made shrewd acquisitions. The best example of this is the company buying YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. YouTube generated $8.1 billion in revenue just in the first quarter of 2024, so it's pretty safe to say it was a great acquisition.\n\nAlphabet is currently rumored to be close to acquiring Israeli cybersecurity company Wiz for around $23 billion. If consummated, the deal is expected to give Alphabet a needed security piece to help it win more cloud computing and AI deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's core search business has a lot of potential to profit from AI. The company is already experimenting with AI overlays to answer some search-related questions, as well as with ways to monetize this new feature. While it has run into some early AI hiccups, AI overlays still open up a potential avenue to serve ads to the large percentage of search results where it does not provide them. Traditionally, the company only serves ad results to about 20% of its search queries and is only paid when these links are clicked.\n\nTrading at 23.5 times forward earnings and a PEG ratio of less than 0.8 times, Alphabet's stock is cheap. Given the potential growth in front of it and its dominant market position in search, the stock looks like a great technology stock to buy and hold for the long term.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Microsoft (MSFT) standing at $442.94, reflecting a +1.33% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.08%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.58%.\n\nShares of the software maker have depreciated by 2.82% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 4.77% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Microsoft in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 30, 2024. On that day, Microsoft is projected to report earnings of $2.90 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 7.81%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $64.16 billion, showing a 14.19% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

        "content": "The graduating class of 2024 from GBSB Global Business School in Spain, including bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and MBA graduates. Courtesy photo\n\nEver since a group of businessmen and educators founded GBSB Global Business School in 2011, it has, by necessity, been agile and adaptive.\n\nIt is headquartered in Spain, a country with more than 80 business schools including some that are ranked among the best in Europe and the world. It has adopted an ethos of constant change to set itself apart, focusing on technologies and models that will shape business of the future.\n\nGBSB continues to evolve. This fall, it will enroll the first cohort of its accredited PhD program and has a redesigned MBA meant to stay current with advanced business trends like AI and sustainability. The school also has a brand new dean and executive president, Wiktor Patena.\n\n\u201cWe are unique in the sense that we are a very digitally-oriented school. Whether it\u2019s a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s program, we always include several courses related to the digital area,\u201d Patena tells Poets&Quants.\n\n\u201cI also believe this school offers value for money. We provide good quality education with a focus on digital areas, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Our programs are highly ranked and accredited, and are reasonably priced. This value for money is what distinguishes us from other similar business schools.\u201d\n\nP&Q INTERVIEW WITH WIKTOR PATENA\n\nToday, GBSB Global offers a full portfolio of undergraduate, graduate, and executive programs all built around an integrated digital ecosystem that connects students in and out of the classroom. In 2017, it became the first business school in Spain to become a Microsoft Showcase School, used as a model for schools that are engaged in the digital transformation in terms of both teaching and learning.\n\nGBSB Global dean Wiktor Patena\n\nIts three-year Bachelor of Business Administration and Digital Innovation has a modular design which allows students to focus their education while still getting the general business degree. The degree offers concentrations ranging from digital entrepreneurship to finance and fintech to sports and E-sports management.\n\nIt offers a 10-month MBA as well as 12 different specialized master\u2019s ranging from Fashion & Luxury to Entrepreneurship to Business Innovation. It also offers a Masters in Management and Master of Science in Management with various fields of concentration.\n\nGBSB Global has campuses in Barcelona, Madrid, and a new campus on the island of Malta which opened in 2021. It also refers to its online offerings as its fourth campus, and most of the degree programs it offers can be taken either on campus or fully online.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatena brings with him both international and accrediting experience, leading his last business school through the grueling, years-long process of AACSB accreditation \u2013 the gold standard in business education. He also brings a long-term vision for GBSB Global that looks to strengthen its position both locally and internationally. This includes embarking on its own AACSB accreditation within the next several years and possibly opening a campus in the Middle East.\n\nPoets&Quants caught up with Patena to talk more about his vision for GBSB Global. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLet\u2019s start with your professional background and your journey to GBSB Global.\n\nI joined GBSB Global in January this year, and I\u2019m still settling down. Prior to this, I was working for HCT (Higher Colleges of Technology) in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the largest educational institution in the United Arab Emirates. I was managing the business school, which was also the largest division within HCT, with about 8,000 students. I started as the director of the MBA program, then became the associate dean, and eventually the Executive Dean. It was an interesting time.\n\nBefore that, I was the Provost at a Polish business school (Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Biznesu), affiliated with National Louis University from Chicago. We were treated like a branch of NLU Chicago, offering double degrees to students. This was one of the first private business schools in Poland.\n\nI would mention two breakthrough moments in my career. As an academic, I realized at some point that I wanted to practice what I preach. I am a finance guy, basically, specializing in company valuation, so together with my mentor, I decided to open a consulting company focused on company valuations. This change allowed me to look at things from a different perspective. When I talk to my students, I have many real-life cases to share because of my consulting experience. This has helped me a lot in my career. I\u2019m glad I can say I practice what I preach, and I think this resonates with our GBSB Global faculty, many of whom are adjuncts and practitioners, just like I was for a couple of years.\n\nLEGO Serious Play\u00a0 is part of the GBSB Global Business School toolkit, where it is integrated into a series of workshops offered within the course curriculum. These workshops cover various topics ranging from Design Thinking to Agile Methodologies, aiming to encourage creative thinking, innovative approaches, and sharpen problem-solving skills among students. Courtesy photo\n\nAnd the other breakthrough moment?\n\nWhile I was in Poland, I took advantage of Poland joining the European Union by participating in the fantastic Erasmus Exchange Programme which allows faculty to travel to different countries for short lectures, typically lasting a week. I traveled to various countries in Europe through this system.\n\nThen, of course, Dubai was another unique experience in terms of travel. Now, being in Malta is different still.\n\nI like the quote by Mark Twain: \u201cTravel is fatal to prejudice.\u201d It\u2019s really true. From my perspective, it\u2019s wonderful to travel to many different countries, meet people, and experience different cultures. There are always some differences, but they aren\u2019t barriers. People are just different. If you have an open mind, you can easily adapt to new environments and be successful.\n\nWhy did the deanship at GBSB Global interest you?\n\nWell, to be honest, I was about to retire. The highlight of my career at HCT in Dubai was getting them accredited with AACSB. This happened in the year I left, and it was a huge event. As you probably know, it\u2019s quite a journey. It took about five years to start and complete the process. I was really a bit tired after that and thought it might be time to return to Europe.\n\nThen, GBSB Global approached me because they had some AACSB aspirations. They were looking for someone who could help them go through this journey successfully. Given my experience, I thought it might not be such a bad idea. I still feel very active, so I decided it was an interesting project to take on, closer to home. I hope to leverage the networking and contacts I have to help GBSB Global achieve this goal.\n\nSo, you went from a five year experience that made you want to retire, and you\u2019re jumping back into the same kind of experience at a new school. That\u2019s interesting. Has that accreditation process started at GBSB Global yet?\n\nNot immediately. When I joined GBSB Global, we were dealing with ACBSP accreditation, which is a different organization, somewhat second rank but similar. We had to complete this process first, which we did successfully some months ago. Now, we have another project, which is local accreditation. As you know, we have three locations: Malta, Barcelona, and Madrid. Barcelona, in particular, because Catalonia feels somewhat separate from Spain, they have some special requirements.\n\nBut then, we have already discussed with top management that once this is done, we will revisit the idea of pursuing AACSB accreditation. In fact, I spoke with the head of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at AACSB just yesterday about moving forward with this project.\n\nGBSB Global regularly invites guest speakers and visiting professors with practical knowledge in different business segments who share first-hand knowledge through case studies and real business examples. Here, Pilar Barrio, Digital Transformation and CX expert and an entrepreneur, speaks to the Digital Business cohort. Courtesy photo\n\nFor our readers who are not familiar, what do you believe sets GBSB Global apart from its competitors?\n\nWell, this is actually a question I asked myself when I joined because each place is different and unique. After a couple of months, I realized that we are unique in the sense that we are a very digitally-oriented school. Whether it\u2019s a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s program, we always include several courses related to the digital area. For example, we offer courses on how to start a digital business and on disruptive technologies. These courses are ubiquitous across the different programs we offer.\n\nAdditionally, we are very focused on innovation and entrepreneurship. One of our flagship projects is called G-Accelerator, which is like a business incubator but more. It\u2019s a pre-incubation mentorship program that prepares individuals with new venture or startup ideas for the next incubation phase. Every year, we receive over 200 applications, and the applicants are shortlisted to go through the program. This has been very successful.\n\nFinally, I believe this school offers value for money. We provide good quality education with a focus on digital areas, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Our programs are highly ranked and accredited, and are reasonably priced. This value for money is what distinguishes us from other similar business schools.\n\nBeyond the accreditation journey, what are some of your big goals for your first tenure? What is your vision for GBSB Global?\n\nAs you said, accreditation is one of the goals. We plan to continue with ACBSP and then start the journey with AACSB, hoping to get accredited within five to six years because that\u2019s what it typically takes.\n\nQuite recently, our PhD program was accredited, so now we offer all three academic levels: bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and PhD. We are launching the first PhD cohort this fall, which is an exciting moment for us.\n\nHow many PhDs are starting the program?\n\nNot that many in the first batch, because we only got accredited in April or March, so we didn\u2019t have much time to advertise. It\u2019s going to be a group of about seven or eight people in the PhD program. The program is very demanding, and it\u2019s not designed for profit\u2014the tuition fees are at a break-even level. But it matters to us for different reasons beyond just tuition fees.\n\nWe are still focusing heavily on our MBA program, with a newly redesigned version being offered in Madrid for the first time.\n\nFinally, although it\u2019s more of a long-term plan, we are thinking of growing internationally. Apart from our campuses in Malta, Barcelona, and Madrid, we may consider expanding to Dubai one day. My experience there could be helpful.\n\nYou mentioned the launch of your revamped MBA. What is new about it, and what do you believe makes it special?\n\nLast year, the MBA was redesigned because the previous one was a typical MBA. By nature, MBAs are offered to people from different walks of life who, for instance, got promoted to a managerial position and suddenly need to know a bit about finance, accounting, marketing, etc. So the previous program was traditional in that sense.\n\nThe new MBA still includes all these major components because that\u2019s what MBAs are for\u2014like, say, for a doctor who suddenly became the director of a hospital. They still need this basic knowledge about different functionalities of the business. However, we added a couple of tracks to keep track of current changes in the business world.\n\nFor example, we have three new courses: one called Artificial Intelligence in the Future, another on Sustainability and Governance, and one more on Consumer Experience in the Digital Environment. This is our attempt to stay current with what\u2019s happening in the business world.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a project management class that functions more like a consulting project done in conjunction with industry partners. This allows students to work directly with companies on real-world projects.\n\nNEXT PAGE:What sets the GBSB Global MBA apart? + Plans for executive education and undergrad programs\n\nA course at GBSB Global.\n\nWhat do you think makes your MBA stand apart from other European MBAs?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s very different from others, but we offer our MBA in different formats. Some MBAs are offered face-to-face, while others are available online. While we don\u2019t yet have rankings for the new format, the previous one was highly ranked by various organizations.\n\nFor example, the full-time MBA was ranked by QS in 2023 as one of the top 60 in Europe. The online MBA was also highly ranked in 2024, placing in the top 30 in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and in the top 100 in the world. These high rankings are quite impressive and are a testament to the quality of our programs, even though I cannot take credit.\n\nSo, I believe our high rankings and the flexibility in formats are what distinguish us in terms of our MBA offerings.\n\nAnything in the undergrad or executive space that has you excited? Any planned innovations or updates?\n\nQuite recently, we looked more closely at executive education projects. Since I\u2019m now residing in Malta, we decided to start here. Just recently, we joined the Malta Chamber of Commerce to build a network of important companies operating in this region and beyond, aiming to offer executive education programs.\n\nWe prepared two kinds of offerings. One is open courses, which are part of our curriculum for different programs anyway, but we believe they might be useful for people outside the school as well. The other is custom-made programs that we can prepare for companies once we establish some connections. This is in process, but we hope it will be successful. I\u2019ve already had talks with a few different companies and met members of the Chamber of Commerce, and I\u2019m looking forward to cooperating with them closely.\n\nGBSB Global dean Wiktor Patena\n\nAre those kinds of executive partnerships new to GBSB Global?\n\nIt\u2019s not new, as we have had a few significant projects in the past, but it was never done consistently. For example, we had a project in Russia a few years ago involving high-speed trains. A group of engineers was brought here to study European examples of high-speed trains, and it was very successful. We also had a project for a company in Qatar, where participants came to enjoy Barcelona and work on a project as part of our executive education program.\n\nSo, while there is a history of successful projects, the goal now is to do it more consistently. We aim to have ongoing projects with these companies, starting in Malta and then offering similar programs in Barcelona and Madrid.\n\nAnd what about in the undergrad space?\n\nOur undergraduate programs are fundamental to what we offer. While 80% of our students are in master\u2019s programs, about 9% are bachelor students.\n\nWhat\u2019s exciting about our undergraduate programs is our focus on applied education and learning by doing. We offer internships, which are not mandatory, but we have specialized units dedicated to arranging internships for students who want to participate. About 20% of our students take internships with companies we arranged for them. This is crucial because staying in touch with the industry is essential.\n\nAnother aspect is our mandatory business simulation games. For students who don\u2019t have the chance to take internships, these simulations are required. I think that\u2019s really important.\n\nAdditionally, as I previously mentioned, we have the G-Accelerator program for students with entrepreneurial ideas. They can apply for this mentorship program and hopefully be shortlisted. I sit on the jury, so I see the exciting ideas students come up with.\n\nFrom my own experience, having run my own business, I always tell my students that being your own boss is incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s an exciting journey where you manage everything.\n\nIs there room to grow in the Bachelor space if it\u2019s only 9% of your students?\n\nOf course, bachelor programs are important to us because they offer a three-year commitment. This allows us to watch students grow and develop over a longer period. So yes, we are actively trying to attract students from all over the world to our bachelor programs.\n\nWe are very international. Historically, we have had students from 150 different countries. It\u2019s exciting for each student to be in a class with peers from 10 to 12 different countries. This diversity naturally teaches them about cultural differences, which is invaluable.\n\nWe are proud of our diverse student body, which recently includes many students from South America, Africa, India, Europe, and the USA. It\u2019s a great feeling to have such a diverse student body.\n\nFor a U.S. business student who is interested in studying abroad, what is the value proposition for GBSB Global?\n\nI know that the U.S. has a great education system. I\u2019m proud of it myself because my daughter graduated from Caltech. But Europe also has a lot to offer. We are located in very attractive locations. For many of our students, just coming to Barcelona, for example, is a great reason to join us. Our school is in the heart of the city, just a 10-minute walk from the famous Las Ramblas Street and other landmarks. Similarly, Malta is an attractive place to study, whether it\u2019s for one semester, two semesters, or even three years.\n\nAnother key point is value for money. Studying at our business school doesn\u2019t cost $30,000 a year, which is a significant consideration for American students. Our programs are well-ranked and accredited by government and professional agencies, offering good quality education at an affordable price. GBSB Global Business School has campuses in Barcelona, Madrid, and Malta in Spain.\n\nWhat are some trends in business education that you\u2019re watching or really excited about?\n\nOf course, I\u2019m watching the trends. I still follow what happens at AACSB because they have access to a huge amount of data. Every school that is a member of AACSB has to send reports every year, contributing to this vast data pool. Recently, I was reviewing their reports, and they identified three trends that I agree with:\n\nFirst, technology integration is crucial. We were one of the first schools showcased by Microsoft as a Microsoft Showcase School. All our communication is done via Microsoft Teams, and we utilize various functionalities like charts and business intelligence dashboard. We use new technologies like Nearpod and Kahoot! and have an excellent virtual learning environment to support our students, especially those studying online. Staying current in this area is important.\n\nSecond, flexible learning environments are key. This means offering programs in different formats: blended, face-to-face, and online. The new generation is used to online delivery, so we offer that as well.\n\nFinally, collaboration with the industry is vital. As I mentioned, we offer internships and the G-Accelerator program. Additionally, we use a lot of adjunct faculty who work in the industry and bring their practical experience to the classroom. The majority of our faculty are part-time adjuncts, which can be seen as a weakness, but is also a strength because students appreciate learning from professionals who practice what they preach and can convey hands-on experience.\n\nWhat are some challenges and opportunities you see for GBSB Global?\n\nLet me start with the challenges. We are in a very competitive market, especially in Barcelona. It\u2019s such an attractive place that it draws many students, but also many business schools, including foreign ones, trying to offer their programs here. We have to compete and differentiate ourselves, which is always a challenge. So far, we have been successful and are growing, but the competition never ends, making it an ongoing challenge.\n\nAs for new opportunities, I mentioned some new locations. We are trying to grow geographically. Currently, we are in three locations, and I think moving to one more location would be a great step to become even bigger. Additionally, we are putting more emphasis on our sales team to attract students from all over the world to come to Barcelona, Malta, and Madrid and start their studies with us.\n\nAnything else you\u2019d like to add?\n\nAs I said, we are in a very competitive business, always looking for new ways to be successful and different from others.\n\nI think we are unique in that we offer education in different locations. This is a bit difficult to manage. For example, I\u2019m currently located in Malta, but I frequently travel to Barcelona and Madrid to manage these three places. We also have a very diverse student population and a diverse faculty, mostly adjuncts and part-time staff.\n\nThese factors make us unique but also more challenging to manage. But, it\u2019s exciting to build a school that is different, dealing with diversity, and incorporating innovation and entrepreneurship into the curricula. We try to follow the latest trends in education, which makes this journey exciting. Every day is different, and you can never take anything for granted as you might in more well-established schools. That makes me eager to wake up in the morning, wondering how exciting the next day will be.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: MBA RANKING: BUSINESS SCHOOL CAREERS, CULTURE AND CURRICULUM AND MINORITIES AT THE TOP U.S. MBA PROGRAMS: AFTER 2 YEARS OF DECLINES, WHAT NEXT?\n\nThe post The P&Q Interview: New Dean Of GBSB Global On Preparing Students For The Digital Future appeared first on Poets&Quants.",

        "title": "Google parent Alphabet to report Q2 earnings Tuesday with AI, ad spending front and center",
        "content": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, giving Wall Street a closer look at the state of the digital advertising market and whether generative AI hype is translating to revenue growth. The tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\n\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\n\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\n\nIn an investor note, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he expects advertising spending to be similar to or better than Q1, with Google paid search growth in the mid-teens.\n\n\u201cFundamentals remain healthy, with solid ad spend, potential benefits from Olympics and elections,\u201d Thill wrote.\n\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt struck a similarly upbeat tone in his investor note. \u201cWe think the setup remains positive heading into 2Q results with our ad survey and agency commentary pointing to continued strength for Google Search,\u201d he wrote. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai speaks during the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference on May 14 in Mountain View, Calif. (Photo by GLENN CHAPMAN/AFP via Getty Images) (GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images)\n\nOn the cloud front, Wall Street is anticipating Google Cloud revenue of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million. That would mark an increase from the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\n\nGoogle still trails both Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud space, with its rivals capturing the number one and two spots, respectively. However, the segment continues to grow, and Alphabet is banking on its investments in generative AI to help power stronger revenue and customer acquisition in the future.\n\nBut when exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google\u2019s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,\u201d Thill wrote.\n\nAs for Google\u2019s search business, Devitt says AI search overviews could create \u201cincremental engagement and may become a tailwind for Search monetization over time.\u201d\n\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren\u2019t always accurate, with now famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the gen AI features.\n\nWhile generative AI is sure to be a major theme this earnings season, it\u2019s still unclear how much it will boost companies' bottom lines. But with Google the first among Big Tech companies to report earnings, it should give us some indication of whether the technology is generating meaningful revenue or not.

        "title": "How the West became dangerously dependent on Microsoft",
        "content": "Travel disruption is expected to carry on this week after Friday's IT meltdown threw airline schedules into disarray - Bav Media\n\nMicrosoft was not directly to blame for the computer bug that caused last weekend\u2019s IT meltdown, but it did not take long for the software giant to become the face of the incident.\n\nHuge screens at airports, hospitals and train terminals all flashed up with the \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, the trademark error screen that displays when Windows computers fail to load correctly.\n\nNews bulletins carried reports of a worldwide \u201cMicrosoft outage\u201d delaying flights and breaking cash machines, while staff at the company\u2019s Seattle headquarters rushed to issue guidance on fixing the issue.\n\nMicrosoft, the world\u2019s second most valuable company with a market value of more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.3 trillion), was quick to point at the root cause of the fiasco: the Texas security firm CrowdStrike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrowdStrike had issued an update containing faulty code to its Falcon cyber defence software that rendered Windows PCs and servers using it inoperable. \u201cThis was not a Microsoft incident,\u201d Microsoft wrote in an online post at the weekend.\n\nThe company said CrowdStrike\u2019s update had affected just 8.5m Windows machines, less than 1pc of the global total.\n\nHowever, the bug disproportionately affected Windows computers, and Microsoft\u2019s ubiquity among businesses and critical infrastructure providers meant the outage was more widespread than it might have been.\n\nThe company is the dominant IT provider to much of the public and private sector, both across PCs and the backend servers on which databases and systems run. Digital boards in Times Square, New York, were taken offline as a result of the widespread outage - Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nThe outage came at a time of increased scrutiny on the West\u2019s dependence on Microsoft for the computer systems that underpin daily life from payments to airline bookings and doctors\u2019 appointments.\n\n\u201cThe reason the outage was so widespread is due to how ubiquitous the Windows operating system is across various industries. Airlines use it for check-in desks, retail use it for point-of-sales machines, and more,\u201d says Jamil Ahmed of IT consultancy Solace.\n\nCyber officials have raised concerns in recent months about dependence on Microsoft, which has faced questions about its own cyber credentials.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company faced criticism over a cyber attack in 2020 that allowed Russian state-sponsored hackers to exploit a flaw in software from another company, SolarWinds, and gain access to thousands of corporate networks, including that of the US government. While Microsoft was also a victim, critics said it had been aware of the flaw before the hack and failed to raise the alarm.\n\nIn the last year, hackers linked to Russia and China have, in separate incidents, managed to bypass Microsoft\u2019s defences to gain access to thousands of US government emails. In the Chinese hack last summer, emails were stolen from Gina Raimondo,\u00a0the US commerce secretary, and Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China.\n\nA flaw in the company\u2019s Exchange server system was also used by Chinese hackers who obtained data from the Electoral Commission last year, security researchers claimed.\n\nPressure on the company culminated in April when an official US report into the Chinese email theft accused the company of a \u201ccascade of security failures\u201d and \u201cavoidable errors\u201d and said that its security culture \u201crequires an overhaul\u201d.\n\nSoon after, AJ Grotto, a former White House cyber policy director, claimed Microsoft\u2019s status as the US government\u2019s IT provider amounted to a national security issue, and said the company should be treated as such.\n\n\u2018Fragile systems\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Lina Khan, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission, tweeted: \u201cThese incidents reveal how concentration can create fragile systems.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft itself has pledged to do better. It has tied bosses\u2019 bonuses to their efforts to promote cybersecurity and promised to make security the company\u2019s top priority.\n\nBut while last Friday\u2019s global IT outage was caused by a CrowdStrike bug, Microsoft faced questions about how the company\u2019s software was able to cause such havoc on Windows machines. CrowdStrike Falcon is installed at the kernel, the highest level of system access, which means that when something goes wrong, it is not isolated to the software itself, but can make the whole computer unusable.\n\nApple machines, by contrast, do not allow security software to run at the kernel level, preventing similar cases. While this could be seen as a security flaw in Microsoft machines, the company said it was required to allow third-party software high-level access due to a settlement with EU competition authorities in 2009.\n\n\u201cIt turns out Windows is configured in such a way that a piece of one piece of buggy code can topple the whole thing, partly because of that EU decision. There\u2019s nothing you could realistically expect Microsoft to have done about it,\u201d says one former cyber official. \u201cBut it is a reminder of that sheer dependence.\u201d\n\nThat EU settlement came in response to concerns that Microsoft had become too dominant in the commercial sector, squeezing out rival providers of antivirus and browser software. Now, the concerns are that too much critical infrastructure relies on it.\n\n\u201cThis event certainly brings public attention to the problem of monoculture,\u201d Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, says.\n\n\u201cWhen a specific software gains significant market and user share, it becomes important, and a potential risk point. In this case, since CrowdStrike software was so popular, and since Windows is extremely widespread, it leads to clearly visible IT chaos, and an availability breach.\u201d\n\nLast weekend\u2019s IT fiasco did not affect everywhere equally. Russian state media boasted of the country being largely shielded from the outages, since sanctions mean it has developed its own homegrown alternatives to Microsoft and CrowdStrike. The impact in China was also less severe, although this was largely due to CrowdStrike being a rarity in the country.\n\nBut for hackers lurking in the two countries, Friday\u2019s chaos will not have gone unnoticed. The outage demonstrated how a single point of failure can bring parts of Western economies to a standstill. Microsoft may not have caused the outage, but our dependence on it means it is a target for those seeking to start the next one.",

        "content": "CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock continued its downward price trajectory Monday as its cloud software update on Thursday triggered an outage that affected businesses worldwide.\n\nA failed update to CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform disrupted Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) systems, halting critical global services, including airports, ports, financial institutions, and hospitals.\n\nMicrosoft said the outage affected less than 1% of Windows users globally, equating to 8.5 million machines.\n\nAlso Read: Goldman Sachs Analyst Stays Course On CrowdStrike Despite Outage, Expects Strong Company Reputation To Aid Recovery\n\nWindows holds about 72% of the global operating system market share, while CrowdStrike commands nearly 24% in endpoint protection security.\n\nMicrosoft clarified that a prior agreement with the European Commission prevents it from adopting the same security measures as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as it battled criticism.\n\nSeveral analysts rerated Crowdstrike stock on Monday, voicing their mixed opinions on the prospects of the stock.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John Difucci downgraded CrowdStrike from Buy to Neutral. BTIG analyst Gray Powell downgraded from Buy to Neutral.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Rob Owens maintained a Neutral and lowered the price target from\u00a0$400\u00a0to\u00a0$310.\n\nOwens notes the CrowdStrike incident as relatively unprecedented. With the incident impacting airlines, hospitals, and 911 call centers, the analyst expects that speculation around litigation will remain for some time, alongside uncertainty around pricing, renewals, and new logo additions. The analyst projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $961.2 million and $0.99.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated an Outperform. Kidron removed CrowdStrike from his 2024 top picks. While the analyst remains positive about the long-term opportunity, he expects shares to face continued pressure near-term.\n\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane reiterated a Buy and a $405\u00a0price target.\n\nRBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an Outperform rating and a price target of $420, down from $380.\u00a0\u00a0Hedberg expects CrowdStrike to emerge as a stronger cyber-security vendor as this was not a breach but rather a significant breakdown in process.\n\nThe analyst considers the outage a possible near-term overhang, which illustrates the interconnected nature of the ecosystem. Hedberg projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $959.8 million and $0.99.\n\nTruist Securities analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr reiterated a Buy with a price target of $400. Fishbein Jr. notes that the outage and impact are a result of a faulty software update rather than a security breach.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst expects the outage to be okay with the fundamental demand for the company\u2019s security solutions. In the near term, it does dent the company\u2019s stellar image, but Fishbein Jr. did not expect its competitors to take market share from CrowdStrike. He remains a buyer on weakness.\n\nScotia Bank analyst Patrick Colville downgraded to Sector Perform from Sector Outperform with a price target of $300, down from the prior $393.\n\nColville voiced a similar opinion as per Trusit analyst Fishbein Jr. Colville projects second-quarter revenue and adjusted EPS of $953.8 million and $0.99.\n\nThe stock plunged 30% in the last five days.\n\nPrice Action: CRWD shares traded lower by 12.8% at $265.74 at the last check on Monday.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for CRWD\n\nDate Firm Action From To Mar 2022 Barclays Maintains Overweight Mar 2022 Canaccord Genuity Maintains Buy Mar 2022 Deutsche Bank Maintains Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for CRWD\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article CrowdStrike Faces Downgrades Amid Concerns Over Pricing and Renewals Following Disruption originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Down on Faulty Update: Should You Buy It Now?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD shares faced a dramatic 11% plunge last Friday, a direct consequence of a faulty update to the company\u2019s cloud-based cybersecurity platform, Falcon.\n\nThe mistake in the Falcon update led to a global IT outage, impacting banks, airports, hospitals, retailers, various businesses and government agencies. This causes significant disruption and economic losses worldwide.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about CrowdStrike\u2019s reliability and long-term prospects, leading to a debate on whether this dip presents a buying opportunity or a signal to stay away.\n\nCrowdStrike Price and Consensus\n\nCrowdStrike price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Quote\n\nWhat Caused the Global IT Outage?\n\nThe chaos was triggered by a defect in a single content update for Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT Windows hosts within CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. The update caused system malfunctions for about 8.5 million or less than 1% of the total Windows devices, leading to severe disruptions for clients globally.\n\nInitially, Microsoft was suspected to be at fault since the outage only affected Windows systems. However, Microsoft clarified that it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve the problem. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz acknowledged the issue, too, and confirmed that a fix had been deployed.\n\nThis incident has highlighted significant vulnerabilities within CrowdStrike's operational processes, casting a shadow over its reputation. While the company's swift acknowledgment and rectification efforts were commendable, the scale of the impact has left a lasting impression on clients and investors alike.\n\nWhy Did an Update Error Cause So Much Chaos?\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform is designed as a cloud-native endpoint security solution, eliminating the need for on-site hardware. This model offers several advantages, including ease of installation, scalability and simplified updates. Falcon\u2019s architecture allows CrowdStrike to secure clients with recurring subscriptions and expand its service offerings through additional cloud-based modules.\n\nThese strengths have been boosting CrowdStrike\u2019s overall financial performance and have established it as one of the leading endpoint security solution providers. The company\u2019s revenues have grown at a CAGR of approximately 52% over the past three fiscal years, from $874 million in fiscal 2021 to $3.06 billion in fiscal 2024. Similarly, its non-GAAP EPS increased more than elevenfold, from 27 cents in fiscal 2021 to $3.09 per share.\n\nThe incident has exposed the risks inherent in cloud-native platforms. While they offer numerous benefits, a single point of failure can have catastrophic consequences. The outage has raised concerns about the robustness of CrowdStrike's quality control and internal testing procedures, suggesting a need for more stringent safeguards to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nMarket Share Loss and Competitor Advantage\n\nThe recent outage has not only damaged CrowdStrike's reputation but also opened the door for competitors to gain market share. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW and Fortinet, Inc. FTNT, among others, stand to benefit from any loss of confidence in CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity market is fiercely competitive, and clients dissatisfied with CrowdStrike's recent performance may consider alternative solutions.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, with its diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services, could attract clients seeking more reliable cybersecurity solutions. Fortinet\u2019s rich experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions might attract customers who are looking to switch to another platform following the aftermath of CrowdStrike\u2019s IT outage.\n\nMicrosoft, which has been steadily expanding its cloud-based cybersecurity offerings, may also see increased interest as organizations reassess their cybersecurity strategies. The high-profile nature of CrowdStrike's failure has amplified the visibility of its competitors, potentially accelerating their market share gains.\n\nLofty Valuations\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s lofty valuation raises concerns over the stock\u2019s upside potential. The stock trades at high multiples relative to its earnings and revenues. Currently, CrowdStrike's price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are significantly above the industry average.\n\nCRWD stock is currently trading at 69.41X forward 12-month earnings compared with 32.33X for the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry. Similarly, it trades at 16.56X forward 12-month sales compared with the industry\u2019s 2.47X.\n\nThese elevated valuations indicate that a lot of future growth is already priced into the stock, leaving it vulnerable to any negative news or earnings misses.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nGiven the recent events, investors should exercise caution with CrowdStrike stock. The faulty Falcon update has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the company's operations, raising questions about its ability to maintain client trust and market dominance. The incident's impact on CrowdStrike's long-term growth prospects cannot be underestimated, and the company may face increased scrutiny and pressure to improve its quality control measures. Moreover, CrowdStrike's high valuation multiples add another layer of risk.\n\nIn light of the recent outage and the competitive landscape, it is prudent for investors to stay away from CrowdStrike for now. The combination of operational risks and high valuation makes this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock a risky proposition.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nBig Tech Earnings Loom: What to Expect\n\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\n\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\n\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\n\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\n\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\n\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\n\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\n\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\n\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\n\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\n\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\n\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week's Earnings Reports\n\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\n\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\n\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\n\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\n\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\n\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\n\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Where Will Intel Be in 7 Years?",
        "content": "Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) has been the rare semiconductor stock that has faltered this year. In fact, as of Friday, Intel was down 34% for 2024, even as the one of the largest semiconductor sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was up 42%. And the trend over the past five years has been even worse, with Intel's underperformance compounding to ghastly levels: INTC Year to Date Total Returns (Daily) Chart\n\nHowever, the company has recently issued positive updates on CEO Pat Gelsinger's ambitious turnaround plan, which began in 2021 and should reach the end of its first stage by next year. In recent months, Intel also issued a long-term financial model that goes out to 2030.\n\nIf management keeps executing and hits its 2030 goals, that would make the stock very, very cheap at current levels.\n\nFive nodes in four years, while building a foundry\n\nIntel's ambitious turnaround has two main-components: becoming the technology leader again for its own products, and opening up its internal fab to external customers to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM). But both of these goals center on the same premise: regaining manufacturing leadership for leading-edge nodes.\n\nThat requires a lot of investment and success in chip design. Another obstacle making things more difficult: Intel's main cash-cow businesses in PC CPUs and traditional server CPUs have been depressed for the past couple of years following the pandemic.\n\nBut for the things it can control, Intel has impressed. The company qualified to receive helping funds from the U.S. government via the CHIPS Act passed in late 2022, and lured in co-investments from big-name investors Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation and private equity firm Apollo Global. Additionally, Intel has even gotten some customers to pre-pay for its upcoming 18A node, which will be in production later this year.\n\n18A is important, as the fifth node of the four-year plan, when management believes it will match TSMC's capabilities. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) recently became the most prominent company to announce it would become a customer of 18A, announcing that in February.\n\nMeanwhile, technology execution has been good. In June, Intel announced it had gotten its Intel 3 node, introduced late last year and the third node of the five-node plan, into mass production on schedule. Intel 3 is a 3nm node, equivalent to what TSMC first produced last year. But Intel's 20A and 18A nodes are following close behind, set for their first production later this year and mass production next year.\n\nIntel's 2030 model\n\nThis year, Intel began separating out the internal foundry from its \"Intel Products\" division, or its in-house designed chips, calculating Products margins as if the Products segment were a third-party fabless company. As you can see, that business has a relatively high 24% operating margin, even though Intel's chips are currently on lagging-edge technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the internal Foundry segment, when separated, shows a massive $7.0 billion loss. That probably spooked investors, as Intel's stock declined in the days after the April 2 presentation. Image source: Intel.\n\nYet Intel has already booked $15 billion in cumulative lifetime value from third parties as of April, and that revenue hasn't shown up yet. As these customers scale, Intel sees the Foundry segment breaking even by 2027, eventually reaching a target of 30% operating margin by 2030, with annual revenue greater than $15 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Intel's Products are forecast to get back to a 40% operating margin, where the company was back when it had process leadership. That should lead the overall company to a 35%-40% operating margin by 2030, with reasonable revenue assumptions. In a recent investor presentation, Intel's director of investor relations provided a model of about $100 billion in total revenue by 2030, based on reasonable industry growth prospects and regaining some market share Intel has lost.\n\nIntel's products will still take up the vast majority of its revenue if the external Foundry is at $15 billion in revenue, leaving about $85 billion for Intel Products revenue. Of note, Intel had $47.7 billion in Products revenue last year, even in a soft year for PCs and on lagging process technology. So that is really not that ambitious of an assumption in seven years' time.\n\nCheap for 2030\n\nAssuming Intel can hit these targets, which management has called reasonable and conservative, that would yield between $35 billion and $40 billion in 2030 operating income.\n\nIntel's market cap is only $140 billion today, which means if the company executes on this expensive and complicated turnaround, the stock is quite cheap, going for less than four times its potential 2030 operating income.\n\nOf course, the big questions around execution and the economic climate from now until then is are what's keeping the price down. But for optimists looking for cheap ways to play AI, this is a turnaround that may just be worth investing in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The consensus call for narrowing the earnings gap between Magnificent 7 stocks and the rest of the S&P 500 may still be overly optimistic, JPMorgan strategists said in a Monday note.\n\nThe bank highlighted that this recurring expectation has not materialized in the last five reporting seasons, with the Mag-7 consistently delivering larger positive earnings per share (EPS) surprises compared to the broader market.\n\nIn the current quarter, consensus projections estimate that the Mag-7 will continue to post significant earnings growth, albeit at a decelerated rate of 29% year-over-year, down from 53% in the previous quarter. The rest of the S&P 500 is projected to see a positive earnings growth of 5% year-over-year for the first time in five quarters.\n\nJPMorgan points out that the Mag-7 stocks, which include tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have been the primary contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth for several quarters. However, the market's high valuation and extreme concentration leave little room for any disappointments.\n\n\u201cThe consensus is yet again betting on the convergence in earnings between Mag-7 and the rest, but that was disappointed on each of the past 5 occasions,\u201d the note states.\n\n\u201cThis could be the case in the current reporting season, yet again,\u201d it added.\n\nMore broadly, the Q2 reporting season is gaining momentum, with sequential activity improvements pointing to better earnings delivery, JPMorgan strategists said.\n\nConsensus estimates for Q2 EPS have seen minimal cuts, just 1% compared to the usual 5% three months prior to results. Analysts forecast a 15% EPS acceleration for the S&P 500 from Q1 to Q4, significantly above historical norms.\n\nSpecifically, Q2 EPS is expected to grow 9% year-over-year. Meanwhile, recent weak consumer data, including a decline in consumer confidence and ongoing weakness in China, suggest mixed company guidance ahead.\n\n\u201cThere has been a raft of profit warnings in consumer space in the past weeks, with poor stock reaction, but also in other areas,\u201d strategists wrote.\n\nThey also said defensive sectors are projected to outperform cyclicals in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Q1 2024 marked the first quarter since Q4 2020 where cyclical EPS growth lagged behind defensives. That trend is expected to continue, supported by falling bond yields and improving relative EPS trends for defensives, which have driven lower-beta leadership in recent months.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJPM: Consensus call for EPS narrowing between Mag-7 and rest may be lacking\n\nStory continues\n\nKorean Air set to order about 20 Boeing 777X jets, sources say\n\nRepublican senator urges defense firm CEOs to safeguard Spirit work",

        "title": "Do Hedge Funds Think That Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Will Skyrocket Soon?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\n\nThe primary lure of investing, as you're likely to know, is to make money. Every day thousands of investors pour into the market to pick out what they believe will be winners to make them rich. And, the market delivers as well. This has been quite clear in 2024, with the hype surrounding artificial intelligence having delivered previously unthinkable returns. Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the chipmaker that's responsible for providing the industry with GPUs to run AI workloads, has gained a whopping 636% since ChatGPT was released in November 2022. This stock ranks 4th in our list of \u00a0Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential, so if you haven't guessed by now, then do take a look.\n\nLooking at these spectacular returns, one would be hard pressed to conclude that if you want to make money on the stock market, then growth is the way to go. But as is the case with most things in life, details are lurking under the hood that go against this simple supposition. On this front, professors from the University of Illinois looked at the returns of large cap and small cap value and growth stocks starting from 1969 and ending in 2001. Taking a geometric mean of these returns, they revealed that large cap growth ('glamour') stocks delivered mean returns of 4.5%, 7.9%, and 3.8% between 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, respectively. On the other hand, large cap value stocks delivered returns of 16.4%, 20.4%, and 18% over the three respective time periods. What's more, is that the returns offered by the value stocks during 1969 and 2001 also surpassed the returns of the S&P 500 index which sat at 11.4%!\n\nBut what about small caps? After all, small caps are all the hype on Wall Street these days as investors position themselves for an interest rate cut. July 11th saw the S&P's flagship index bleed 91 basis points, with the technology heavy NASDAQ shedding 1.98%. The NASDAQ's drop was led by its 100 most valuable non financial companies which shed 2.15% during the same day. On the other hand, the rising fortunes of small cap stocks accelerated on the 11th. The leading small cap stock index gained 2% during the day and nearly matched this during the first half an hour of trading on the 12th by gaining 1.6% as it opened significantly higher after the after and pre market trading sessions.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these gains, you might be wondering which small cap stocks might be worth their while. Well, we looked at analyst sentiment as part of our coverage of 8 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready to Explode According to Analysts and hedge fund sentiment as part of 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential so you should check them out if you're interested in small cap stocks.\n\nComing back to the professors' research, during 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, small cap growth stocks, were down by 2.8%, 1.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. On the other hand, small cap value stocks delivered geometric mean returns of 18.3%, 22.8%, and 17.7%, respectively. Seems like over the long term, investing in value stocks appears to be just as, if not more, worthwhile while large cap growth stocks appear to fare better than their small cap. peers.\n\nWhile you might be thinking that these stats do not apply to the current market, it's also true that they are relevant to an extent especially since 1990 to 2001 was characterized by soaring valuations fuelled by internet stocks. Right now, AI is all that anyone can talk about, even as investors are moving out of big ticket technology names into the under appreciated small caps. Back then, the shares of a California based internet connectivity equipment provider soared by a whopping 53,207% between January 1991 and April 2000. So, this would have seen $1,000 invested during the start soar to $533,000 at the peak, which, fair to say, is life changing money for most of us. Yet, those same shares are down by 36% since then and had tumbled by as much as 79% by February 2009. If you're interested in knowing what this stock is, it ranked 8th on our list of the 10 Best Communication and Media Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nAt the same time, not all growth stocks end up lower. Some of the biggest examples that weathered the storm after the dotcom bubble popped are the largest companies today. They belong to the eCommerce, consumer and enterprise software, and the broader technology industries. Today's mega cap stocks have gained anywhere between 6,455% to 203,377% and 437,010% since they were listed for trading. Safe to say, these 'fads' of the time weren't fads and the market knew what it was doing.\n\nTheir returns are also what drive growth investors in droves to the stock market. While eCommerce and consumer technology were trends of the past, there are dozens of trends that newsletter publishers have embraced with open arms these days as they promise the next stock capable of delivering 10x or even 100x in returns. Since you're likely to be aware of AI at this point, we'll skip it out and list some other ideas. One of the biggest, and perhaps underreported ideas that newsletters have been pitching is quantum computing. Quantum computing expands the amount of data that a traditional computer can compute, and while its stocks haven't delivered strong returns yet, publishers believe that the future is bright. You can look at some quantum computing stocks and a broader industry overview by reading 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\n\nOne trend that has delivered returns is weight loss. Since March 2023, these stocks have delivered as much as 173% in returns, and with newer products such as pills under development, some folks believe that there's more room left for growth. Another highly pitched trend is energy, specifically nuclear energy, uranium miners, and energy infrastructure stocks. All these will benefit from the growth in electricity consumption from AI data centers, according to newsletter publishers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that might skyrocket, we scanned investment newsletters from Stock Gumshoe and narrowed down 20 stocks from newsletters dated back as far as June 13th. These were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 and the top ten stocks were chosen. Stock Gumshoe's thesis and the date of each newsletter are also mentioned.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 293\n\nDate of Newsletter: July 9th\n\nComing back to Navellier, this stock had a \"cash flow of $9.1 billion\" in Q4 2023 which puts it on track to become the \"largest company in the world for at least the next 10 years.\" Safe to say, this isn't a small cap stock or a startup. Some hints about its business model include the firm's operations in \"cloud computing, cybersecurity, software, gaming, hardware, search,\" and we'll make it easy for you by sharing that it isn't Google parent Alphabet. If you're an avid follower of the technology industry, you should have guessed it by now, but if you haven't, then Navellier reminds you that this stock can provide the \"perfect mix of stability and low risk.\"\n\nThis stock is the mega cap technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Navellier's latest stocks are all about QaaS, and Gumshoe also notes that two of China's largest technology conglomerates, Alibaba and Baidu have both given up on their quantum investments lately. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s forward P/E of 36x does make it expensive, and investing in an S&P linked fund could provide exposure to its stock coupled with other tech heavy weights.\n\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that will skyrocket. You can visit 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "MSFT, AMZN, or GOOGL: Which Cloud Computing Player is the Best AI Stock?",
        "content": "The generative artificial intelligence (AI) wave has boosted the prospects for various categories of companies within the tech sector, including semiconductor makers, cloud computing providers, and cybersecurity players. In particular, cloud computing companies are witnessing solid demand for their services that are required to support enterprises and developers in building their generative AI models.\n\nBearing this favorable backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to place Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) against each other to find the cloud computing company that is the best AI stock and could offer the highest returns from the current level, as per Wall Street analysts.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nWhile Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market leader in the cloud infrastructure market, rival Microsoft Azure is catching up rapidly. In the March quarter (Q3 FY24 for MSFT), revenue from Azure and other cloud services increased 31% compared to AWS\u2019 sales growth of 17% in the comparable quarter.\n\nDuring the Q3 FY24 earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that Azure is grabbing market share, with customers using the company\u2019s platforms to build AI solutions. The CEO added that the company provides a diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the most recent offerings of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and MSFT\u2019s own AI chip.\n\nMicrosoft claims that over 65% of the Fortune 500 companies are using Azure OpenAI service, thanks to continued AI innovation that is backed by the company\u2019s strategic partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Overall, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business is seen as one of its key growth drivers.\n\nIs Microsoft a Buy or Sell?\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to announce its Q4 FY24 results on July 30. Analysts expect the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to rise 9% year-over-year to $2.93.\n\nAhead of the results, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a Buy rating on MSFT stock and boosted the price target to $495 from $470. The analyst expects the company to deliver another upbeat quarter of growth and margins. He is optimistic about Azure\u2019s potential, with data points indicating continued growth acceleration trends. Overall, MSFT remains \u201cbest-positioned for AI monetization,\u201d according to Wood.\n\nWith 34 Buys versus one Hold recommendation, Microsoft stock scores a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average MSFT stock price target of $504.12 implies 15.3% upside potential from current levels. Shares have advanced more than 16% so far this year.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nDespite rising competition, Amazon\u2019s AWS unit continues to maintain a dominant position in the cloud computing market. According to Synergy Research Group, AWS commanded a 31% market share of the cloud infrastructure services market in Q1 2024, while Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud had market shares of 25% and 11%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS\u2019 sales grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion. This growth rate marked an acceleration compared to the 13% increase experienced in Q4 2023. It is worth noting that AWS is a vital growth engine for Amazon and is highly profitable. In Q1 2024, AWS accounted for 17.5% of the overall sales but contributed more than 61% of the company\u2019s operating income.\n\nAmazon is optimistic about the robust potential of its AWS business. CEO Andy Jassy stated during the Q1 2024 earnings call that the company is seeing notable momentum on the AI front, which is accumulating a \u201cmultibillion-dollar revenue run rate already.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Target Price for Amazon Stock?\n\nAhead of Amazon\u2019s Q2 results scheduled to be announced on August 1, analysts at Morgan Stanley reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock, with a positive near-term outlook. Morgan Stanley expects AMZN to report a notable EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) beat in the second quarter and issue favorable guidance for the third quarter.\n\nIn particular, Morgan Stanley\u2019s EBIT estimate is 17% higher than the Street\u2019s consensus for Q2 and 10% more than the Q3 forecast. The optimistic outlook is based on AMZN\u2019s North America Retail profitability and accelerating AWS growth.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Amazon\u2019s EPS to increase to $1.02 from $0.65 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nAmazon stock earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 44 unanimous Buys. At $223.05, the average AZMN stock price target implies about 22% upside potential. Shares have risen 21% year-to-date.\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nTech giant Alphabet is well known for its Google search engine. That said, the company\u2019s Google Cloud business is grabbing Wall Street\u2019s attention with its rapid growth. Alphabet impressed investors with its solid first-quarter results, which were driven by a major jump in Google Cloud\u2019s profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Google Cloud\u2019s revenue increased 28.4% year-over-year to $9.57 billion, while its operating income surged to $900 million from $191 million in the prior-year quarter. The results reflected Alphabet\u2019s increased investments in the Cloud business. Interestingly, during the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the company introduced over 1,000 new products and features in its Cloud business over the past eight months.\n\nThe company believes that one of the aspects that differentiates its Cloud business from rivals is its AI Hypercomputer, which offers cost-effective and efficient infrastructure to train and support AI models.\n\nIs it a Good Time to Buy GOOGL?\n\nOn July 18, analysts at Jefferies reaffirmed a Buy rating on GOOGL stock with a price target of $220. They expect Alphabet to report strong Q2 results, supported by resilient customer spending and consistent Cloud business. However, Jefferies cautioned investors about slightly tougher comparisons in Q2, mainly in the ad business.\n\nAfter a solid year-to-date rally in GOOGL stock (up 27.2%), Jefferies expects continued rise but at a gradual pace due to high expectations following robust Q1 performance and above historical average valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet will announce its Q2 2024 results on July 23. Wall Street expects Alphabet\u2019s Q2 EPS to rise 27% to $1.83.\n\nWall Street has a Strong Buy consensus rating on GOOGL stock based on 33 Buys and six Holds. The average GOOGL stock price target of $202.89 indicates 14.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nWall Street is bullish on the long-term growth potential of the top three cloud computing players, driven by the continued transition of enterprises to the cloud and AI-related tailwinds. Currently, they see slightly higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in Microsoft and Alphabet shares. Aside from the attractive growth potential of the AWS business, analysts\u2019 optimism about Amazon is also backed by the company\u2019s leadership in e-commerce and its growing advertising business.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Small businesses grapple with global tech outages created by CrowdStrike",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An owner of a consumer insights research firm couldn't pay her employees, make Friday's deadline to sign a contract for a new business or send key research to a key client. A psychiatrist, who runs a virtual mental health practice in Maryland, saw his business hobbled as some of his virtual assistants and therapists couldn't either make phone calls or log on to their computers. And a restaurant owner in New York City was worried about how he was going to pay his vendors and his workers.\n\nBusinesses from airlines to hospitals have been grappling with a faulty software update that caused technological havoc worldwide on Friday, and its repercussions continued through the weekend. The breadth of the outages highlighted the fragility of a digitized world dependent on a few providers for key computing services.\n\nBut the problem appeared to divide those affected into haves and have-nots. Major customers of Microsoft and CrowdStrike are getting IT support to resolve the issues, but many smaller businesses whose Windows PCs may have received the problematic update are still struggling.\n\nTake Tsvetta Kaleynska, owner and founder of the Manhattan-based consumer insights company RILA Global Consulting, which has Fortune 500 clients. As of Saturday, she resolved the payroll issue and she got an extension until Monday on the research project. But the prospective client will not move forward with the new contract, cutting her annual earnings by nearly 25%, she estimated. The problem: she couldn't sign the contract because Docusign, which runs on Microsoft software affected by the faulty update, was down.\n\n\u201cIf I were part of a big company, then I would be able to delegate and get support from computer science or security services,\u201d Kaleynska said. \u201cBut as a small business owner, I am depending only on myself. It's pretty devastating.\"\n\nOn top of Kaleynska's business issues, she had to bring her ill daughter to a local hospital Friday because the hospital's phone lines were down.\n\nKaleynska, an immigrant from Bulgaria who became a U.S. citizen in 2023, said she's learned a hard lesson: \u201cOur lives are very fragile because they\u2019re based on technology, and we depend on technology.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike is one of the largest cybersecurity firms in the U.S. and has a list of customers that includes more than half of the Fortune 500 companies as well as small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nFollowing the outage, the company provided an initial fix through a software update. But many computers are expected to need hands-on work that could take days, if not longer, to complete.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor many small businesses that are impacted, that could mean working around the clock this weekend to make sure their systems are up and running, said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses rely on third parties for this not to happen and instead, it became a \u2018code red\u2019 situation,\u201d Ives said.\n\nOverall, Ives noted tech problems can be easier to fix for big companies that have a sizable number of experts on their payroll as opposed to small businesses who could face more of an \u201cuphill battle\u201d because they have fewer technical resources.\n\n\u201cThe ripple effects from this could be felt for days and weeks ahead,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's not just a black eye moment for CrowdStrike, but for the broader industry. You can\u2019t have one fat finger update take down a global ecosystem.\u201d\n\nAri Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Heinz College, agreed, noting the amount of money big companies spend on Microsoft and CrowdStrike is likely a large portion of their IT budget. On the other hand, small businesses can look at information online on how to resolve the outage. CrowdStrike has posted step-by-step manual fixes to its blog, but it can be intimidating for those who are less tech savvy.\n\nLightman said those corporations could sue for a loss of business, but small ones might use class action suits to go after CrowdStrike for compensatory damages.\n\nThe issue is affecting small businesses differently.\n\nHeather Garlich, a spokeswoman at Arlington, Va., grocery industry group FMI, said the outages were \u201csomewhat spotty and inconsistent depending on how businesses use certain Microsoft tools.\u201d She said she was aware of one with an issue with a human resource system, while another had problems with their routing system for distribution. Yet another had issues with its cash registers.\n\nChris Seabrook, who owns a locksmith services business in Melbourne, Australia, called Asguard Locksmiths, told The Associated Press in a Friday email that the IT outage had thrown a \u201csignificant wrench\u201d in his daily operations. He hasn\u2019t been able to send and receive emails, access critical files, manage his schedule or create invoices.\n\n\u201cMy Microsoft PC is essential for many important functions in my business,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a one-man business, every minute counts and this disruption has forced me to adapt quickly to ensure my services remain as uninterrupted as possible.\u201d\n\nTo minimize the disruption, Seabrook borrowed a non-Microsoft device from a friend that enabled him to sign into his accounts and access some of his critical tools and information. He\u2019s also using his smartphone for important messages and organizing his schedule. And he's been contacting clients to update them on the situation. Seabrook didn't immediately respond to a follow-up email sent by The Associated Press on Saturday.\n\nSome small business owners have improvised to get work done.\n\nDr. Ozan Toy, a psychiatrist, and chief medical officer at the Maryland-based Telapsychiatry, which has 25 employees across the U.S., said some employees with Microsoft phone lines instead turned to the Ring Central System, while others shifted from Microsoft Teams to Zoom.\n\nToy said his business was fortunate to have several backups of its electronic medical record system, allowing them to resume communications with each other and their patients. As of Sunday, the practice's cloud based services were running, he said. Toy noted financial losses were \u201cminimal\u201d as it has an external answering service taking calls from patients.\n\nChris Delmond, the co-owner of Handcraft Hospitality, which operates three restaurants in Manhattan and one in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, said his restaurants remained open for business. But the outage meant he could not have access to his cloud-based accounting software app on the Microsoft platform. That prevented him from seeing receipts and invoices, and slowed his ability to process checks to his employees and suppliers. He had to resort to calling his banks to see whether deposits had been made and check balances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a small business owner. I have two other partners and we kind of do everything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s up to us to find out what the issues are. I don\u2019t have large platforms that help me track.\u201d\n\nBut by late Friday afternoon, all the issues related to his business' cloud based systems were back to normal, Delmond said. He noted he didn't suffer any financial losses, but he added, \u201cIt's frustrating, but as a small business owner you deal with the ups and downs.\"",

        "content": "The video game industry is on the cusp of a turnaround after a tumultuous few years that saw sales come back down to earth from the lofty heights they reached during the early days of the pandemic. And things should only get better in 2025, as Nintendo (NTDOY) prepares to launch a follow-up to its outrageously successful Switch console and Take-Two (TTWO) readies for the release of its highly anticipated \u201cGrand Theft Auto VI.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say that the games industry overall is poised for an upswing,\u201d former Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cJust this past month, late last month, there were a number of game announcements across the industry that consumers reacted really well to,\u201d said Fils-Aim\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThese are new games coming later this year. It's games that are coming in 2025. There's new platforms coming, namely from Nintendo, as well as rumors of an adaptation to the [PlayStation 5] coming. So there are a lot of positive things that signal that we've essentially gone through the trough for the video game industry, and now we're poised for an upswing.\u201d Take-Two's \"Grand Theft Auto VI\" is expected to be a strong catalyst for the game industry's recovery in 2025. (Chris Delmas /AFP via Getty Images) (CHRIS DELMAS via Getty Images)\n\nThe video game market experienced a boom during the beginning of the pandemic, as consumers around the world retreated to their homes with little to do but play video games and stream shows and movies.\n\nAccording to IDC, global mobile game revenue shot up 32.8% to $99.9 billion in 2020, while digital PC and Mac game spending jumped 7.4% to $35.6 billion. Home console game spending, meanwhile, soared 33.9% to $42.9 billion.\n\nBut that growth declined quickly in the following years. Mobile gaming revenue grew just 15% in 2021 before declining 3.3% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023. PC and Mac game sales climbed again in 2021 by 8.7% but fell 1.4% in 2022, though the segment experienced a slight uptick of 2.1% in 2023.\n\nAnd after rocketing in 2020, console game spending stalled out in 2021, with growth sitting at 0.7%, before revenue declined 3.4% in 2022. It did, however, return to growth in 2023.\n\nThose 2020 console sales were also buoyed by the launches of Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation 5 and Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. But system sales struggled due to the supply chain crisis at the time, hindering growth. Nintendo is expected to launch the successor to its popular Switch console in 2025. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou had significant investment leading into the launch of new machines by Microsoft and by Sony. You had essentially free money,\u201d Fils-Aim\u00e9 explained. \u201cSo game developers were creating a plethora of content and, candidly, some content that probably shouldn't have been created that hit the marketplace. And it, candidly, just didn't do very well in 2023. So the market contracted.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThose declines also led to industrywide mass layoffs, with thousands of workers losing their jobs as companies ranging from Microsoft and Sony to Riot and Unity (U) cut positions. And the layoffs haven\u2019t stopped in 2024, with EA (EA) laying off some 5% of its workforce and Sega cutting 240 jobs.\n\nBut the downturn should be coming to an end.\n\n\u201cI think we're through the worst of it,\u201d explained Mat Piscatella, executive director and video game industry adviser at Circana.\n\n\u201cMobile has really been carrying the load the first half of the year and is the biggest reason why the overall content spending numbers have remained as strong as they have. Through the end of May, 2024 content spending on mobile gaming in the U.S. has grown 12% compared to a year ago. The PC, Cloud and Non-Console VR segment in the U.S. has also performed well, with spending also gaining 12% through the end of May compared to last year,\u201d Piscatella added.\n\nThe home console market, however, has continued to struggle, though it\u2019s expected to get reinforcements with fall game releases and the next-generation Nintendo console next year, not to mention a burgeoning handheld market led by Valve\u2019s Steam Deck portable system.\n\nAnd while growth is unlikely to be as wild as it was at the onset of the pandemic, it should still provide relief for the industry overall.

        "title": "Stock-Split Fever: 2 Recent Stock-Split Stocks and 1 That Could Be Next",
        "content": "This has been another year of high-profile stock-split announcements, including Walmart, ChipotleMexicanGrill, and LamResearch. And while stock splits do not change the underlying fundamentals of a company, they can boost interest in stocks. Moreover, there is some research to suggest that stock-split stocks outperform the market.\n\nHere are three stocks that have already split this year -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) -- plus one more that may split sometime soon, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia's sky-high valuation could be a warning sign\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): There's no way to talk about stock-split mania without discussing Nvidia. Simply put, the stock market has gone gaga over Nvidia -- taking the company from a market cap of $280 billion to over $3 billion in just under two years.\n\nAs a result of its skyrocketing stock price, Nvidia's board of directors authorized a 10-for-1 stock split in May of this year, bringing the company's stock price down from over $1,200 to around $120.\n\nThat stock split, like all common stock splits, did not change any of the company's fundamentals.Similar to running a pizza cutter across a freshly baked pizza, a stock split simply divides what already exists into smaller, more manageable pieces; it doesn't create more pizza.\n\nUltimately, investors need to pay attention to Nvidia's fundamentals -- now more than ever. To put it bluntly, the company's stock is nearing levels that should give investors pause.\n\nTake the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, for example. Nvidia stock has a lifetime P/S ratio of 8.4x. That's much higher than the average stock, which trades with a P/S ratio closer to 3x.However, within the tech industry, P/S ratios of 6 to 10 are common.\n\nYet, what is truly concerning is that Nvidia's current P/S ratio isn't anywhere close to that range -- it's 37x. Accordingly, investors today are paying about 4 times above its long-term historical P/S average. NVDA PS Ratio ChartNVDA PS Ratio data by YCharts\n\nSo, even after Nvidia's enormous revenue growth (company revenue has nearly tripled from $25 billion to $70 billion over the last two years), much of the rise of Nvidia's stock is coming from investors paying higher prices. In short, investors are paying up for future growth and hoping that the company can meet -- or beat -- rising sales expectations.\n\nThat's a risky proposition, meaning investors might want to look elsewhere for a better value.\n\nBroadcom's first-ever stock split could juice an already supercharged stock\n\nWill Healy(Broadcom): Broadcom just executed its first stock split. The technology giant has dramatically benefited from artificial intelligence (AI), and its stock has increased by more than 80% over the last year. Despite those gains, it is not necessarily too late to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom leverages AI in two ways. Its business-to-business chip solutions segment designs specialized semiconductors for its clients, and as such, it creates chips to support AI. Also, amid a growing enterprise software business, it can underpin a client's software needs.\n\nThose capabilities appeared to bolster its stock gains, particularly over the last year. That growth, in turn, likely prompted the 10-for-1 stock split it initiated on July 12.\n\nStill, investors should remember that Broadcom has been a growth stock throughout its history. The former Avago Technologies launched its IPO at a split-adjusted price of just $1.50 per share in 2009. During that time, the stock price grew by more than 100-fold. So massive was its growth that its dividend, now at $2.10 per share annually, is 40% higher than the original IPO price!\n\nDespite such increases, investors have to look past a critical financial metric. In the first six months of fiscal 2024 (ended May 5), net income of $3.4 billion dropped 53% yearly. That may deter investors, especially since that contributed to the P/E ratio rising to 69.\n\nAdmittedly, the high P/E ratio makes it expensive, and the stock is likely not invulnerable to a downturn should market sentiment change.\n\nHowever, investors should keep in mind that revenue rose 39% yearly over the same period, and the company used some of the revenue increase to invest in itself when it increased operating expenses by 150%. Such actions could increase profits in the long term, taking the stock price higher over time.\n\nAdditionally, the split could help as the lower nominal price makes whole shares more affordable, a factor that should add to its considerable long-term gains.\n\nTech giant Microsoft is becoming an increasingly obvious stock-split candidate.\n\nJustin Pope (Microsoft): Tech giant Microsoft hasn't split its stock in recent memory, but that could soon change. The company frequently split during the 1990s until the infamous dot-com bubble popped in 2000. Shares plunged and took nearly two decades to recover.\n\nBut Microsoft has now risen to levels few may have predicted. Technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence have continued to fuel non-stop growth over the past decade: MSFT Chart\n\nNow, shares are much higher than they were years ago. Investors and employees sitting on massive investment returns from holding stock may not want to sell in $400 to $500 increments. A stock split would lower the share price and give them some flexibility. It would also make it easier for those buying stock to build a position without having a lot of money for big purchases.\n\nA potential stock split may become more sensible over time. Analysts believe Microsoft will grow earnings by an average of over 16% annually for the next three to five years. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 34, which is reasonable considering Microsoft's anticipated growth.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nShares are poised to climb higher on strong earnings growth over the coming years, so a split only makes sense. Investors should keep Microsoft on their radar as the next potential stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Microsoft Stock Is Great, But I'm Not Buying Because of This Huge Red Flag",
        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) investors have done very well for themselves over the past few years. It doesn't hold the title of the world's largest company at the moment, but Microsoft retained that position for many months due to its strong success.\n\nAlthough practically any time in the past has been a great time to buy Microsoft stock, I'm avoiding it right now due to one huge red flag, which I think it could be a dealbreaker for the stock.\n\nMicrosoft is excelling\n\nTo use a Microsoft Office pun, Microsoft excels as a business. All three business segments are doing great, with each one growing revenue at a strong pace.\n\nThe intelligent cloud segment led the way, with revenue growing by 21% to $26.7 billion. This division houses Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing business. Because many artificial intelligence (AI) models are run on Azure's infrastructure, it's benefiting tremendously from the AI arms race.\n\nAfter multiple quarters of underperformance, the more personal computing segment (which includes its gaming and hardware divisions) grew revenue by 17%. This was heavily influenced by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which is likely why it grew revenue in the quarter versus the more historical trend of shrinking sales.\n\nFinally, Productivity and Business Processes, which includes all of its Office subscriptions, saw revenue grow by 12%. This was the weakest division, but 12% growth is still healthy.\n\nIn the third quarter of its fiscal year 2024, ended March 31, Microsoft knocked it out of the park. And it will likely do so again when it reports Q4 earnings on July 30. But, to own the stock, you have to pay a hefty premium, which is where my red flag comes from.\n\nMicrosoft's stock is too expensive compared to its peers\n\nBecause Microsoft's stock run-up has occurred at a quicker pace than its earnings growth, the stock has a premium valuation. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 33 times forward earnings, Microsoft stock isn't cheap. Compared to the S&P 500, which trades at 22.7 times forward earnings, investors have to pay up to be a Microsoft shareholder. Because the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio uses analysts' estimates, it's not a perfect measure. A better use for this metric is to compare it to its historical average P/E ratio to determine what expectations are built into the stock.\n\nOver the past five years, it traded for 32 times trailing earnings. This indicates that after a year's growth, Microsoft would return to its average valuation.\n\nHowever, the past five years have been unique with low interest rates, so this estimation may be aggressive when determining a long-term P/E ratio. Suppose we lower the P/E ratio to 25 times earnings, a more historical average valuation for a company with best-in-class execution. In that case, Microsoft must grow its earnings by 54% to reach that figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not an insurmountable growth rate, but it does require sacrificing a couple of years of growth.\n\nSo, while Microsoft's business will likely continue doing well, I'm concerned that the stock has already pulled those gains forward. Instead of Microsoft, I'd consider other big tech stocks like Alphabet or Meta Platforms that already trade around that 25 times earnings mark. Additionally, these two are also growing at similar or faster speeds than Microsoft, meaning their business growth will more directly translate to stock price appreciation.\n\nI think Microsoft is a great business, but the price investors have to pay is just too rich at the moment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

ATMs stopped working, flights were delayed, and crucial healthcare services went offline.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the incident was caused by a \"defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" and that a fix had already \"been deployed.\" Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which was initially blamed for the outage because it only occurred on Windows systems, said it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve those issues.\n\nCrowdStrike certainly made a massive mistake and the market's reaction is understandable. But others are wondering if this news-driven pullback represents a good buying opportunity. Are they right? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did CrowdStrike's outage cause so much damage?\n\nIn the past, most cybersecurity companies installed on-site appliances to run their services. But that hardware was expensive, sucked up power, took up a lot of space, and required constant maintenance.\n\nCrowdStrike addressed those issues with Falcon, a cloud-native endpoint security platform that didn't require any on-site appliances. As a cloud-based platform, Falcon was easier to install, scale, and update than appliance-based platforms. It also enabled CrowdStrike to lock clients into sticky recurring subscriptions and cross-sell more cloud-based modules to grow its revenue per customer.\n\nThose strengths have enabled CrowdStrike to grow like a weed since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65%, from $250 million to $3.06 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike now serves 298 of the Fortune 500 companies and 538 of the Fortune 1000 companies. However, that widespread adoption explains why CrowdStrike's flawed update caused so much damage in such a short time.\n\nHow fast was CrowdStrike growing?\n\nOver the past year, as macro headwinds forced many companies to rein in their spending, CrowdStrike's growth in both ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) and total revenue decelerated. But its net new ARR growth rose by double-digit percentages year over year again over the past three quarters -- which meant it was still gaining new customers in a challenging market.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = year over year. Note: Ending ARR is the sum of preexisting ARR with net new ARR.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike attributed that robust growth to its market-share gains, new government contracts, and the rollout of more generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for Falcon. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% a year earlier.\n\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, Kurtz notably took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) new platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- saying \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\" Unfortunately, CrowdStrike's recent software blunder might just drive some companies to try out Palo Alto's more diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services instead.\n\nAt the time, CrowdStrike expected its revenue to grow 30%-31% in fiscal 2025. It also planned to continue its five-quarter streak of profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But given those estimates (which will likely be reduced) and its current enterprise value of $67.5 billion, it still looks expensive at 17 times this year's sales.\n\nWill this outage impact CrowdStrike's long-term growth?\n\nThe big question now is how much this fiasco will throttle CrowdStrike's long-term growth. Bulls will argue that the company's leadership of the cloud-native cybersecurity space, its sticky cloud-based ecosystem, and the high costs of switching to another platform will prevent it from losing too many customers in the aftermath of the IT outage.\n\nHowever, Kurtz admitted it would take \"some time\" before the problem update was rolled back and all of the affected systems were fully restored. CrowdStrike could also be hit by plenty of lawsuits after this debacle, and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said his company had already \"deleted CrowdStrike\" from all of its systems.\n\nThe incident also made CrowdStrike, which hadn't been widely recognized outside of tech and business circles, a household name in the worst possible way. Warren Buffett once said it \"takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it\" -- and the damage to CrowdStrike's brand could certainly erode its defenses against its eager competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has been quietly expanding its own cloud-based cybersecurity platform over the past few years, with big investments and acquisitions. This embarrassing incident could drive Microsoft to accelerate the development of those internal services, in order to curb its dependence on CrowdStrike and other third-party cybersecurity platforms.\n\nSo is CrowdStrike's pullback a buying opportunity?\n\nI own shares of CrowdStrike, but I think it would need to pull back even further before it's considered a bargain. It's still up more than 90% over the past 12 months and isn't cheap -- and we can't yet gauge the long-term impact of this disastrous outage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Chinese cybersecurity companies are taking advantage of the massive Microsoft Windows outage that upended businesses and grounded flights around the world on Thursday and Friday by promoting their own software, as Beijing pushes to cut the country's reliance on foreign suppliers.\n\nAustin, Texas-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused the outage, one of the largest in history, by pushing a bad software update that crashed the Windows operating system. It affected airports, banks, and hospitals, among many other businesses.\n\n360 Security Technology, China's largest cybersecurity firm, took the opportunity to promote its products, which it claimed were \"more reliable, stable, comprehensive and intelligent\".\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Xinhua alt=Visitors tour the Chinese internet security firm Qihoo 360 booth at the World 5G Convention in Beijing on November 21, 2019. Photo: Xinhua>\n\nQAX, another well-known firm in the sector, wrote in a blog post on Friday that \"software vendors involved in system stability need to have stricter quality control of their software\".\n\nTencent Holdings, which operates the Tencent PC Manager platform, said on Friday that it received reports from some users who experienced the Windows error screen, known as the blue screen of death. It referred users to CrowdStrike's official workaround steps to resolve the problem.\n\nThe incident adds to Beijing's list of reasons for seeking to move away from foreign technology as it pursues technological self-reliance in the face of mounting export restrictions and sanctions from Washington. Key infrastructure was largely unaffected in China, where only foreign businesses and luxury hotels were hit.\n\nWhile Microsoft said on Friday that its systems had been restored, many businesses continued to deal with the fallout.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, whose passenger check-in system collapsed, issued a notice on Saturday saying operations had returned to normal.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina's cybersecurity market is dominated by local players. Beijing has long been phasing out software from companies like Russia's Kaspersky Lab and US-based Symantec. CrowdStrike does not sell products and services in China, according to its website.\n\nCrowdStrike shares fell 11.1 per cent to US$304.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday, while Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent. Competitors SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks gained 7.85 per cent and 2.16 per cent, respectively.\n\nWhile China has pursued technological self-reliance to varying degrees for decades, the government's mistrust of foreign commercial software deepened after the 2013 leaks from US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed methods that the National Security Agency used to access information from some of the world's biggest tech companies.\n\nThe government made a concerted push to completely switch to domestic security software a decade ago, according to a 2014 report by state-owned China News Service.\n\nAll the departments of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have installed 360 software, the report said, and state-owned enterprises would follow by also installing domestic alternatives.\n\nCrowdStrike has made monitoring for Chinese cyberattacks an important part of its business, as Western countries have warned of an increasing number of attacks coming from China-linked actors.\n\nIn 2015, the company reported seven Chinese cyberattacks against US technology and pharmaceutical companies. China's foreign affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at the time that \"the Chinese government would not in any way participate, encourage or support enterprises in engaging in the theft of trade secrets\".\n\nIn its latest annual report, CrowdStrike said that \"China-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third-party relationships\" in 2023.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Malicious actors trying to exploit global tech outage for their own gain",
        "content": "As the world continues to recover from massive business and travel disruptions caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, malicious actors are trying to exploit the situation for their own gain.\n\nGovernment cybersecurity agencies across the globe and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz are warning businesses and individuals about new phishing schemes that involve malicious actors posing as CrowdStrike employees or other tech specialists offering to assist those recovering from the outage.\n\n\u201cWe know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this,\u201d Kurtz said in a statement. \u201cI encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you\u2019re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\u201d\n\nThe UK Cyber Security Center said they have noticed an increase in phishing attempts around this event.\n\nMicrosoft said 8.5 million devices running its Windows operating system were affected by the faulty cybersecurity update Friday that led to worldwide disruptions. That\u2019s less than 1% of all Windows-based machines, Microsoft cybersecurity executive David Weston said in a blog post on Saturday.\n\nHe also said such a significant disturbance is rare but \u201cdemonstrates the interconnected nature of our broad ecosystem.\u201d\n\nWhat's happening with air travel?\n\nWith their tightly timed, interwoven schedules and complex technology systems, many big airlines struggle to stay on time when everything goes well. It perhaps was not surprising that the industry was among the hardest hit by the outage, with crews and planes caught out of position.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Saturday on the U.S. East Coast, airlines around the world had canceled more than 2,000 flights, according to tracking service FlightAware. That was down from 5,100-plus cancellations on Friday.\n\nAbout 1,600 of Saturday\u2019s canceled flights occurred in the United States, where carriers scrambled to get planes and crews back into position after massive disruptions the day before. According to travel data provider Cirium, U.S. carriers canceled about 3.5% of their scheduled flights for Saturday. Only Australia was hit harder.\n\nCanceled flights were running at about 1% in the United Kingdom, France and Brazil and about 2% in Canada, Italy and India among major air-travel markets.\n\nRobert Mann, a former airline executive and now a consultant in the New York area, said it was unclear exactly why U.S. airlines were suffering disproportionate cancellations, but possible causes include a greater degree of outsourcing of technology and more exposure to Microsoft operating systems that received the faulty upgrade from CrowdStrike.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhich airlines are getting hit the hardest?\n\nDelta Air Lines canceled more than 800 flights, or one-fourth of its schedule for Saturday, and that number did not include Delta Connection regional flights. It was followed by United Airlines, which dropped nearly 400 flights.\n\nThe worst airport to be, for a second straight day, was Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where Delta is the dominant carrier. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that thousands of people spent the night at the airport, many sleeping on the floors.\n\nEuropean airlines and airports appeared to be recovering slowly, although Lufthansa and its affiliates canceled dozens of flights. Its Eurowings budget subsidiary said check-in, boarding, booking and rebooking flights were all available again, although \u201cisolated disruptions\u201d were possible.\n\nLondon\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was busy but operating normally on Saturday and that \u201call systems are back up and running.\" Flights at Berlin\u2019s main airport were departing on or close to schedule, German Press Agency dpa reported, citing an airport spokesman.\n\nHow are healthcare systems holding up?\n\nHealth care systems affected by the outage faced clinic closures, canceled surgeries and appointments and restricted access to patient records.\n\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Calif., said \u201csteady progress has been made\u201d to bring its servers back online and thanked its patients for being flexible during the crisis.\n\n\u201cOur teams will be working actively through the weekend as we continue to resolve remaining issues in preparation for the start of the work week,\u201d the hospital wrote in a statement.\n\nIn Austria, a leading organization of doctors said the outage exposed the vulnerability of relying on digital systems. Harald Mayer, vice president of the Austrian Chamber of Doctors, said the outage showed that hospitals need analog backups to protect patient care.\n\nThe organization also called on governments to impose high standards in patient data protection and security, and on health providers to train staff and put systems in place to manage crises.\n\n\u201cHappily, where there were problems, these were kept small and short-lived and many areas of care were unaffected\u201d in Austria, Mayer said.\n\nThe Schleswig-Holstein University Hospital in northern Germany, which canceled all elective procedures Friday, said Saturday that systems were gradually being restored and that elective surgery could resume by Monday.\n\nWill the tech industry face a reckoning?\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that surprised that an accident caused severe global digital disruption. I was a little surprised that the cause of it was a software update from a very well-respected cybersecurity company,\u201d said Oxford University management professor Ciaran Martin, a former chief executive of the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Center.\n\n\u201cThere are some very hard questions for CrowdStrike. How on earth did this update get through quality control?\" he said. \"Clearly the testing regime, whatever it is, failed.\u201d\n\nMartin said governments in the U.K. and the European Union will be powerless to take steps to prevent such breakdowns \u201cbecause we have become dependent on a very American version of technology, and the power to do anything about that doesn\u2019t rest in this continent.\u201d\n\nOther analysts doubted that the outage would lead Washington or any other government to propose new mandates on tech companies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the mandate would be. Do better QA?\u201d said Gartner analyst Eric Grenier, using an acronym for quality assurance.\n\nWhat did scam artists learn from the outage?\n\nGrenier expects that a majority of affected machines will be fixed in about a week, with more time needed to reach laptops used by far-flung workers because the work can\u2019t be done remotely \u2013 it\u2019s a hands-on operation.\n\nIn the meantime, there will be scammers trying to take advantage of businesses that have indicated they were affected by the outage.\n\n\u201cThe threat is very real,\u201d Grenier said. \u201cBad actors have the information to send targeted phishing emails and calls. They know what endpoint-protection tools you use. They know you use CrowdStrike.\u201d\n\nGrenier said affected businesses need to make sure they use a fix supplied by CrowdStrike. \u201cDon\u2019t accept the help of somebody coming out of the blue and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll fix that for you,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nIsabella O\u2019Malley in Philadelphia, Stephen Graham in Berlin and Technology writer Matt O'Brien contributed to this report.",

        "content": "CrowdStrike Shares Trim Heavy Losses As Microsoft Announces Resolution Of Global Tech Outage: 'This Is Clearly A Major Black Eye'\n\nU.S. cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is attempting to recover sharp premarket losses felt overnight and in the early hours on Friday as an update on its cloud software triggered a global tech outage.\n\nWhat Happened: A failed update of CrowdStrike's Falcon platform on Thursday night led to widespread disruptions in Microsoft systems, pushing critical global services such as airports, ports, financial institutions and hospitals to a standstill. The issue stemmed from a technical error in the software update, ruling out initial speculation of a hacker attack.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50 per share.

(NYSE:S), Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and Okta Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) saw their shares rise by 6.3%, 2.9%, and 1% respectively.\n\nWhile Microsoft's Windows systems were impacted, Mac and Linux hosts remained unaffected, as confirmed by CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz.

        "content": "A passenger waits at Gatwick Airport as flights were hit by delays and cancellations following the global IT outage - Benjamin Cremel/AFP\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have had their foreign summer holidays thrown into jeopardy by a global IT outage that caused chaos at British airports on Friday.\n\nAround 200,000 people are set to be hit by delays and cancellations caused by the IT meltdown, which was triggered by a faulty update to a widely-used piece of cyber security software. Many travel insurers are refusing to pay to rearrange holidays.\n\nNHS services, train services, cash machines and contactless payments were also taken offline, with 999 services facing long delays after GP surgeries were unable to make appointments.\n\nThe worldwide IT outage was caused by a glitch in cyber security software made by CrowdStrike, a US company, which caused millions of computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows to crash suddenly on Friday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt resulted in a so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, sending the computers into recovery mode.\n\nAn emergency meeting of Cobra officials was called to address the chaos, and Louise Haigh, the Transport Secretary, said her department was \u201cworking at pace with industry and across Government on the issue\u201d.\n\nWhile most of the technical problems were resolved by Friday night, the impact on summer holidays is expected to last for days.\n\nFriday was scheduled to be the busiest day at British airports since October 2019 as schools broke up for the summer holidays.\n\nAs 5,078 flights were cancelled globally on Friday, including around 160 UK flights, passengers were hit with queues of more than three and a half hours.\n\nStaff at airports from Heathrow to Bangkok were forced to manually check-in travellers after the technical glitch sent their systems into meltdown. Edinburgh Airport halted all arriving flights for around two hours on Friday as aircraft backed up on the Tarmac.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryanair urged passengers to leave airports, saying: \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nDelta and United Airlines both imposed so-called ground stops on Friday morning, preventing flights from taking off while airline staff rushed to fix crippled computers.\n\nThe disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position to run their scheduled services.\n\nPassengers who have had their flights cancelled also face problems if trying to recoup lost costs from travel insurers, as many do not cover accommodation if travel is disrupted. MoneySuperMarket, the comparison site, confirmed that there were likely to be hundreds of travel policies that would not provide any cover for Friday\u2019s events. Disruption is set to carry on into next week as airlines struggle to get aircraft and pilots back into position for scheduled services - Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nPaul Charles, a travel expert, said: \u201cIt will take until Monday to recover. It\u2019s turmoil that the industry doesn\u2019t need on one of the busiest weekends of the year.\u201d\n\nMr Charles estimated that 25,000 people were directly affected by the cancellation of nearly 300 flights to and from the UK.\n\nAirlines are responsible for arranging a replacement flight but may struggle to accommodate people, with travel experts warning that most flights were already expected to be fully booked.\n\nTravellers hoping to rebook their own travel faced having to arrange their own transfers, with routes to some popular destinations, such as Athens, no longer having direct flights available.\n\nGeorge Kurtz, the CrowdStrike chief executive, told NBC, the US broadcaster, he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the fault and admitted it would be \u201csome time\u201d before all the problems were resolved. He confirmed that the incident was not a cyber attack.\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s software is widely used by businesses and is designed to protect companies from hacking, but a broken file included within a routine update to the technology almost immediately broke Windows computers that had the programme installed.\n\nThe company said it had since managed to fix the problem, but IT experts warned that many businesses were having to manually repair their computer systems.\n\nGP surgeries in Britain were unable to access patient records or book appointments, with the NHS advising people only to contact a doctor if their ailment was urgent.\n\nCancer appointments were cancelled at some hospitals as radiology departments were hit by the outage, and some NHS systems remained down on Friday evening. The National Pharmacy Association warned that disruption was likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nHolidaymakers hoping to use the railways for a getaway were also hit by the disruption. Thameslink, Southern Rail and Gatwick Express faced \u201cwidespread IT issues across our entire network\u201d that left bosses unable to tell drivers which trains they were meant to be working on.\n\nSouth Western Railway said all its ticket machines had stopped working on Friday morning. National Rail Enquiries advised passengers to \u201cpurchase your ticket online, on the train or speak to a member of station staff\u201d.\n\nOn the high street, card payment systems at Waitrose and Gail\u2019s, the bakery chain, stopped working, with staff having to take cash instead.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange\u2019s in-house news service went offline, while Sky News was forced to pull its morning broadcast and replace it with pre-recorded footage.\n\nAdam Leon Smith, a cyber security expert at the British Computer Society, said it could take \u201cdays and weeks\u201d for some companies to get back online, while Ciaran Martin, a former head of GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, estimated that the economic damage from the glitch would \u201crun into the billions\u201d.\n\n07:12 PM BST\n\nWrapping up...\n\nThanks for joining us on this live coverage of a widespread technology outage, which affected companies and services around the world, grounding flights, knocking GP systems offline and preventing many people from paying for their shopping.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide.\n\nThe company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, noting that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\n06:58 PM BST\n\nIT meltdown shows how horrifyingly exposed we are to total economic collapse\n\nOver-dependence on cloud software has left the world one glitch away from disaster, writes business columnist Matthew Lynn:\n\nThe planes stopped flying, the trains stopped running and countless other services were disrupted around the world.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long the outage that hit global computer systems on Friday lasts. With any luck, it will be fixed quickly and the damage will be relatively minor.\n\nAnd yet one point is surely clear: from the abolition of cash to the reliance on just-in-time supplies, we have become terrifyingly dependent on a tiny number of cloud-based computer systems.\n\nWe may be just one glitch away from a total economic collapse \u2013 and worst of all, for all the fashionable talk of \u201csecuronomics\u201d, our political leaders are just making that worse.\n\nOver the course of Friday, chaos rippled out across the world.\n\nRead the full article...\n\n06:56 PM BST\n\nPensions and ISAs giant Vanguard says services restored\n\nInvestment platform Vanguard has emailed customers to say that services have been restored. It said:\n\nWe are aware of technical issues you may have experienced on our UK Personal Investor platform today due to a 3rd party global IT issue.\n\nHowever, we are pleased to confirm our services have resumed and you can access your Vanguard account.\n\n06:51 PM BST\n\nGail\u2019s bakery investor attacks Crowdsource\n\nA serial restaurant entrepreneur who formerly chaired Channel 4 has attacked CrowdSource, expressing surprise that the cyber security business has not plunged by more on the stock market today.\n\nLuke Johnson is an investor in Gail\u2019s bakery, which was unable to accept card payments as a result of the outage. He noted that the CrowdSource\u2019s shares are highly priced compared to the business\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t the shares collapsed 50pc or more?\u201d he said.\n\nShares are currently down 12.3pc.

Travel warns of potential for lost bags\n\nA traveller at Gatwick Airport said he had been queuing for more than three-and-a-half hours ahead of a flight to Miami, Florida.\n\nDean Seddon, 42, from Plymouth, told the PA news agency: \u201cThere are just people everywhere, there must be 400 people in this queue for the check-in desk I\u2019m at ... it\u2019s just bedlam.\u201d\n\nLance and Penny Spraggons said they had been waiting in a queue to check in at the West Sussex airport for more than an hour.\n\nMr Spraggons said: \u201cThe biggest problem is the lack of information.\u201d\n\nThe queue at Stansted snaked outside the main terminal building.\n\nCourtney Kemal, 32, who had been in the queue for around two hours by late morning, said her two sons aged five and seven were \u201cobviously getting stressed\u201d.\n\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said passengers due to travel today \u201cwill naturally be deeply concerned\u201d.\n\nHe went on: \u201cIf you can, avoid checking in a bag as queues for check-in at the airport will be long and IT failures typically lead to lots of lost bags.\n\n\u201cIf you do check-in bags, make sure you keep medication, keys and any other essentials in your hand luggage.\u201d\n\nHe said passengers will not be eligible for compensation for delayed or cancelled fights due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, but airlines have a duty to look after them, including providing meals, accommodation and alternative flight bookings if necessary.\n\n06:11 PM BST\n\nPharmacies warn of weekend disruption while outage hit 60pc of GP practices\n\nThe National Pharmacy Association has warned that disruption from today\u2019s IT outage is likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nThousands of GP practices have also been affected by the outage today, with NHS England confirming there has been an issue with the EMIS Web system, which is understood to be used by about 60pc of practices in England.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England said:\n\nThe NHS has long-standing measures in place to manage the disruption, including using paper patient records and handwritten prescriptions, and the usual phone systems to contact your GP.\n\nThere is currently no known impact on 999 or emergency services, so people should use these services as they usually would.\n\nThere are also some issues with administrative systems in hospitals that mean staff are having to work manually from paper to manage certain tasks but in the majority of hospitals, care is continuing as normal.\n\nPatients should attend appointments unless told otherwise. Only contact your GP if it\u2019s urgent, and otherwise please use 111 online or call 111.\n\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said:\n\nOur members are telling us that today\u2019s outage is causing considerable disruption to GP practice bookings and IT systems - practices using EMIS IT systems appear to be particularly affected.\n\nOutages like this affect our access to important clinical information about our patients, as well as our ability to book tests, make referrals, and inform the most appropriate treatment plan.\n\nShe asked patients to \u201ctry and wait\u201d until the outage is resolved if their issue is not urgent.\n\nEMIS Web is the most widely used clinical system for primary care in the UK.\n\nIt enables GP practices to book appointments, examine records and manage admin.\n\n05:54 PM BST\n\nCancelled UK departures reach 143\n\nSome 143 flights scheduled to depart UK airports on Friday have been cancelled amid the global IT outage, aviation analytics company Cirium said.\n\nThis equates to 4.6pc of scheduled departures, the firm said, while 142 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled.\n\n05:52 PM BST\n\nCrowdStrike rivals jump on stock market\n\nRivals to CrowdStrike jumped on the stock market, while the company at the centre of today\u2019s outage has plunged.\n\nThe outage could force customers and investors alike to rethink their dependence on the company, opening the door to potential rivals like Palo Alto Networks, which saw its stock rise 1.7pc on Friday, and Sentinel One, which jumped as much as 3.6pc.\n\nGil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson, said:\n\nThis event is a reminder of how complex and intertwined our global computing systems are and how vulnerable they are to a mistake and an error.\n\nWhile most companies don\u2019t really have an alternative to Microsoft, they do have alternatives for security.\n\nThis may cause many companies to reconsider which security product they use, and whether they need to diversify across different security products in order to prevent these types of outages.\n\nHowever, other analysts said that while Friday\u2019s events had been damaging for CrowdStrike, they did not foresee competitors taking much market share as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a major black eye for CrowdStrike and the stock will be under pressure,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, but he noted that the incident stemmed from a technical update and not a hack or cybersecurity threat, which he said would be \u201cmore worrying\u201d.\n\n05:42 PM BST\n\nOutage requires \u2018boots on the ground\u2019 to fix, says IT analyst\n\nFixing today\u2019s IT outage is not an easy fix, requiring \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to remediate, a leading analyst has said.\n\nEric Grenier of Gartner said:\n\nThe fix is working, it\u2019s just a very manual process and there\u2019s no magic key to unlock it. I think that is probably what companies are struggling with the most here.\n\nWhile not everyone is a client of CrowdStrike and its platform known as Falcon, it is one of the leading cybersecurity providers, particularly in the transportation and banking sectors that have a lot at stake in keeping their computer systems working.\n\nGregory Falco, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University, said:\n\nThey\u2019re usually risk-averse organisations that don\u2019t want something that\u2019s crazy innovative, but that can work and also cover their butts when something goes wrong. That\u2019s what CrowdStrike is. And they\u2019re looking around at their colleagues in other sectors and saying, \u201cOh, you know, this company also uses that, so I\u2019m gonna need them, too.\u201d\n\n05:33 PM BST\n\nElon Musk says CrowdStrike deleted from his systems\n\nThe billionaire behind Telsa, SpaceX and and social media giant X has posted: \u201cWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems\u201d.\n\nWe just deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems, so no rollouts at all\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 19, 2024\n\n05:25 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft suggests turning computers off and on again\n\nWhile IT engineers are bogged down trying to fix thousands of broken computers, Microsoft says one solution may simply be to turn them off and on again. Matt Field reports:\n\nIn a technical update to customers, Microsoft said some \u201cvirtual machines\u201d - often used for home-working computers - could be fixed by repeatedly turning them off and on, 404media reported.\n\n\u201cWe have received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe high tech advice echoes that given in the Channel 4 show, The IT Crowd, in which Chris O\u2019Dowd\u2019s character\u2019s catchphrase is: \u201cHello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?\u201d\n\nIn the latest technical update from CrowdStrike, the company said the bug in its update was sent out at around 5.09am this morning, impacting millions of computers.\n\n05:16 PM BST\n\nNew York regulators say banks should be on high alert of cyber attacks\n\nNew York state regulators urged banks and companies to be on high alert amid the global tech outage on Friday, saying it is monitoring institutions and market events and working with other state and federal regulators.\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services \u201creminds all regulated entities to be vigilant at this time. Threat actors have been known to launch attacks during periods when IT and security staff are distracted, especially through social engineering,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe department supervises more than 3,000 financial institutions in New York.\n\n05:14 PM BST\n\nFixing the IT outage could take \u2018weeks\u2019, says industry expert\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored.\n\nHe said:\n\nThe fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks.\n\nMicrosoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux - and so this could have been much worse.\n\nCrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been impacted by the bug.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\n05:09 PM BST\n\nMore than 2,600 flights cancelled so far\n\nOut of over 110,000 scheduled commercial flights on Friday, 2,691 have been cancelled globally so far and more are expected to be called off, according to data from global aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n\nIn Edinburgh, a Reuters witness said boarding pass scanners carried a \u201cserver offline message\u201d, with the airport saying passengers shouldn\u2019t travel to the airport without checking their flight status online first.\n\nElsewhere, airports and airlines advised customers to arrive earlier than normal for flights. Analysts said the outage was likely tied to a glitch in Microsoft software used globally.\n\nThe aviation sector is hit particularly hard due to its sensitivity to timings. Airlines rely on a closely coordinated schedule often run by air traffic control. Just one delay of a few minutes can throw off a flight schedule for take-offs and landings for an airport and airline for the rest of the day.

While not a cyberattack, the outage is a worrisome reminder of how our systems are deeply integrated.\n\n04:57 PM BST\n\nHeathrow Airport \u2018working hard\u2019 to minimise effects of the outage\n\nHeathrow Airport said it is \u201cworking hard\u201d to get passengers \u201con their way\u201d following a major global IT outage. It added:\n\nWe continue to work with our airport colleagues to minimise the impact of the global IT outage on passenger journeys.\n\nFlights continue to be operational and passengers are advised to check with their airlines for the latest flight information.\n\n04:55 PM BST\n\nMicrosoft urges customers to follow Crowdstrike guidance\n\nMicrosoft has put out a statement saying:\n\nWe are aware of a scenario in which customers experience issues with their machines causing a bug check [blue screen] due to a recent CrowdStrike update. We recommend customers to follow guidance provided by CrowdStrike.\n\n04:52 PM BST\n\nAmbulance service receiving more calls amid IT outage\n\nThe North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) said it is experiencing a \u201chigher volume\u201d of calls from patients who are not able to contact other NHS providers following global IT issues.\n\nTaryn Lake, director of finance and digital at NEAS, said:\n\nSo far, we have experienced minor disruption to our services as the result of the national IT outage.\n\nWe are currently working with partners for the continuity of our service.\n\nHowever, we are experiencing a higher volume in calls from patients who are unable to contact other NHS providers and we are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nI am signing off at this point for a lie down and to get as far away from any computers as possible. I will hand over the reins to Alex Singleton.\n\n04:41 PM BST\n\nFlight cancelled or delayed? Here\u2019s what you need to know\n\nFlights around the world have been disrupted after a massive outage caused Windows computers to suddenly shut down.\n\nChief consumer and culture editor Nick Trend explains what you need to know about refunds and compensation:\n\nOn Ryanair\u2019s website, the company urged passengers to arrive at airports three hours early, blaming a \u201cthird-party IT issue, which is outside Ryanair\u2019s control and affecting all airlines operating across the network\u201d.\n\nTravellers at airports including Gatwick, Los Angeles and Madrid have shared photos on social media showing long queues as airlines grapple with increasing delays. Air passengers in India were even given hand-written boarding passes in an effort to keep things running smoothly.\n\nWhat are passengers caught up in the chaos entitled to? The detail around customer rights in this area is sometimes complicated, but the main principles are straightforward.\n\nFrom severe weather to tech outages and air traffic control issues, read your rights if your flight is cancelled or delayed.

But now it looks like they are checking bags so we might stay.\u201d\n\nAmerican Airlines said in a post on social media platform X that it had been able to \u201csafely re-establish our operation\u201d following a \u201ctechnical issue with a vendor.\u201d\n\nUnited Airlines said, also on X, that \u201csome flights are resuming\u201d as it worked to restore full operations, while Delta Airlines reported it too had resumed \u201csome flight departures.\u201d\n\nAnd Frontier Airlines said it was \u201cgradually normalising\u201d and \u201cin the process of resuming flight operations,\u201d with its ground stop now lifted.

Our ability to operate the electricity system and supply electricity remains unaffected. Our engineers have been and continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d\n\nBritish Gas, which supplies gas to homes and businesses, said it had not experienced any problems, as did rivals Octopus Energy whose spokesman said: \u201cBoth Octopus and Kraken systems have been unaffected by the Microsoft system outage.\u201d [Kraken is the software designed by Octopus and used by other energy companies for managing bills and other systems.]\n\nOfgem, the energy industry regulator, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced no IT impact as a result of the reported outage.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for National Gas, which manages much of the high pressure gas grid, said: \u201cWe are aware of the global IT issues currently affecting multiple companies. National Gas does not deploy the security software likely to be the root cause across any of its systems and is therefore not directly impacted by these events.\n\n\u201cWe remain in close contact with the wider industry and our supply chain to manage any residual impact and will continue to monitor our systems and operations closely.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for EDF, which runs the UK\u2019s nuclear power stations, said: \u201cEDF is not experiencing any direct impacts to critical business systems. We are supplying power and serving our customers as normal but will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d Nuclear sites were unaffected, it said.\n\nRWE, the German company that generates\u00a015pc of the UK\u2019s electricity via its fleet of gas-fired power stations, hydroelectric plants and several wind farms, said it was unaffected.\n\n04:09 PM BST\n\n999 calls surge amid global IT failure\n\nThe London Ambulance Service (LAS) has experienced \u201chuge increases\u201d in the number of calls to its 999 and 111 services following global IT issues.\n\nLAS chief executive Daniel Elkeles said:\n\nFollowing the global IT outage that has impacted some NHS services across the capital, our call handlers and ambulance crews are incredibly busy with huge increases in the number of calls to both our 999 and 111 services.\n\nIn fact, by 2pm today, we had received more than 3,000 999 calls and 3,000 calls to our 111 services - this is a third higher than we would usually receive in a full 24 hour period.\n\nOur teams are always here to help if you need us and we encourage anyone who needs our services to continue to contact us.\n\nWe are working very hard to make sure we are getting to patients as quickly as possible, but please be aware that our response times today may be impacted by this global issue.\n\nWe ask that people use our 999 services wisely and contact their pharmacy or visit NHS 111 online where possible. Londoners can continue to help us by only calling 999 in a serious medical emergency.\n\n04:06 PM BST\n\nPorts suffer delays from IT outage\n\nBritain\u2019s major ports revealed they have suffered delays to haulage and rail shipments as a result of the IT glitch.\n\nThe Port of Felixstowe\u00a0posted a message on its website to say it was hit by the \u201cglobal IT Crowdstrike issue\u201d at 5.40am.\n\nIt said haulage and rail operations have recommenced, and \u201cwe are working up to full capacity as soon as possible\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Peel Ports, which runs a number of docks around the country, told The Loadstar that the Port of Liverpool\u2019s connectivity to the a key industry messaging system \u201cwas temporarily interrupted for a couple of hours early this morning, but this was fully restored by 9.45am\u201d.

It is not easy to know what the future holds. You can\u2019t plan fully for every possible risk. But we must do what we can to learn the lessons of this period.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s first responsibility is to keep the public safe. That\u2019s a top priority for this Government with a long-term approach to strengthening our national resilience. I will lead a review of our national resilience against the range of risks that the UK faces. I\u2019ll chair a dedicated Cabinet Committee on resilience to oversee that work.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, it\u2019s not just about central Government. We will work with the devolved governments, our regional mayors and local leaders as we consider the recommendations in this report. Because when we have an emergency, we should do everything we can to work together locally and nationally.\u201d\n\n10:39 AM BST\n\nFTSE 100 slumps amid IT chaos\n\nLondon markets dropped in value after the IT failure, which has caused issues around the world for banks, supermarkets, airlines and other major institutions.\n\nThe FTSE 100 fell 0.8pc in early trading as investors were spooked by the outage potentially hitting companies\u2019 bottom lines if it goes on too long.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange said securities trading was unaffected by the outage, but its regulatory news service was not working.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said:\n\nCountless industries, from airlines and trains to banks and media, face disruption to earnings if they cannot do their job.\n\nWorkers cannot get from A to B and that will have a knock-on effect for industries across the board if staff aren\u2019t there to perform important functions or systems are offline.\n\nThe severity of the problem boils down to how long it lasts.

Falcon is what is known as an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform, which monitors the computers that it is installed on to detect intrusions - hacks - and respond to them.\n\nThat means that Falcon is a pretty privileged piece of software in that it is able to influence how the computers it is installed on behave.\n\nFor example, if it detects that a computer is infected with malware that is causing the computer to communicate with an attacker, then Falcon could conceivably block that communication from occurring. If Falcon is suffering a malfunction then it could be causing a widespread outage for two reasons - one: Falcon is widely deployed on many computers, and two: because of Falcon\u2019s privileged nature.\n\nFalcon is a bit like anti-virus software: it is regularly updated with information about the latest online threats (so it can better detect them). We have certainly seen anti-virus updates in the past causing problems. It is possible that today\u2019s outage may have been caused by a buggy update to Falcon.\n\n09:32 AM BST\n\nLuton Airport running manual systems amid outage\n\nLuton Airport said the global IT outage is affecting some airlines and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are aware of an ongoing global IT issue that is impacting check-in and boarding procedures for some airlines.\n\nWe have additional staff on hand to support and operations are continuing with manual systems.\n\nPassengers are advised to check with their airlines for flight updates.\n\n09:26 AM BST\n\nAir passengers left stranded amid travel chaos\n\nThe pictures of unhappy travellers are coming in thick and fast now as airlines grapple with increasing delays: Passengers are facing long queues at Gatwick after the IT outage - @sergepoliakoff Passengers waiting at Barajas Airport in Madrid - REUTERS/Elena Rodriguez Travelers at Los Angeles International Airport have been forced to sleep in a jetway for a delayed United Airlines flight hit by the IT outage - AP Photo/Stefanie Dazio\n\n09:21 AM BST\n\nPassengers given hand-written boarding passes\n\nAir passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage.\n\nHere is a shot of a ticket from low-cost airline IndiGo: Air passengers in India are being given hand-written boarding passes as airlines grapple with the IT outage - @akothari\n\n09:19 AM BST\n\nMicrosoft 365 taking \u2018mitigation actions\u2019\n\nMicrosoft 365 say they are investigating an issue impacting users\u2019 ability to access apps and services.\n\n\u201cOur services are still seeing continuous improvements while we continue to take mitigation actions,\u201d they said on X this morning.\n\n\u201cWe still expect that users will continue to see gradual relief as we continue to mitigate the issue.\u201d\n\nIt comes amid reports of widespread IT outages affecting airlines, broadcasters and banks.\n\n09:15 AM BST\n\nGP appointment booking systems down\n\nGP appointment booking systems are down following the global tech outage, the NHS has confirmed.\n\nOur health editor Laura Donnelly has the latest:\n\nHealth officials said family doctors are struggling to access systems, with some practices saying they are unable to book appointments.\n\nThe main IT system used by primary care is understood to have been hit by the problems, which have seen airports, banks and television channels knocked offline.\n\nGP surgeries hit by the outage have said the issue \u201cwill have a big effect\u201d.\n\n09:12 AM BST\n\n999 unaffected by outage\n\nPeople are still able to phone 999 in an emergency, despite the IT outage disrupting GP services.\n\nAn NHS spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re not currently aware of 999 services being affected.\u201d\n\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: \u201cNo issues that we\u2019re aware of for the Met.\u201d\n\n09:10 AM BST\n\nGatwick warns passengers \u2018may experience some delays\u2019\n\nLondon Gatwick airport has said \u201cpassengers may experience some delays\u201d due to the global outage.\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the airport posted:\n\nWe are affected by the global Microsoft issues, so passengers may experience some delays while checking in and passing through security.\n\nPassengers should still arrive for their normal check-in time.\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience and are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

        "content": "What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday?\n\nARM Holdings Plc (NASDAQ:ARM) shares are trading higher after Morgan Stanley analyst Lee Simpson upgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised its price target from $107 to $190.\n\nThe upgrade comes as the broader semiconductor sector has seen a selloff this week following Donald Trump\u2019s verbal attack against contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) and the U.S.\u2019s plans to intensify advanced semiconductor sanctions against China.\n\nAI chip stocks led by Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) lost 9% and 18% this week.\n\nAt the Computex forum in Taipei, Arm CEO Rene Haas said he expects 100 billion Arm devices worldwide to be AI-ready by the end of 2025.\n\nArm Holdings plans to showcase its AI chip in 2025 and launch it commercially by fall 2025. Parent company Softbank Group Corp (OTC:SFTBF) (OTC:SFTBY) aims to invest significantly in data centers using its AI chips and renewable energy.\n\nAMD CFO Jean Hu recently suggested a potential entry into next-generation AI PCs.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about Arm Holdings, citing strong licensing interest and royalty potential as essential growth factors. They also highlight Arm\u2019s opportunities in the AI and data center sectors.\n\nArm Holdings stock rose by 158% over the past 12 months as AI integrated into smartphones. The ARM (Acorn RISC Machine) architecture powers 99% of the world\u2019s smartphone CPU cores. Apple, Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of Arm\u2019s major customers.\n\nArm\u2019s clients choose the company over Intel Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:INTC) x86 technology primarily for its efficiency and widespread adoption. Arm\u2019s architecture enables chips to consume less power compared to x86, making it ideal for mobile devices and other power-sensitive applications, CNBC reported in 2023.\n\nKey clients like Apple, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, MicrosoftCorp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NvidiaCorp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and QualcommInc (NASDAQ:QCOM) leverage Arm\u2019s technology to build custom silicon tailored to their specific needs.\n\nARM Holdings has a consensus price target of\u00a0$112.17 based on the ratings of 25 analysts.\n\nARM Price Action: Arm shares traded higher by 3.47% at $163.83 at the last check on Friday.\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Arm Stock On Friday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The chief executive of CrowdStrike, the firm at the centre of the global IT outage, has said he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the incident, but warned it would take \u201csome time\u201d for systems to be fully restored.\n\nGeorge Kurtz said a fix had been deployed for a bug in an update rolled out by the cybersecurity firm which affected Microsoft Windows PCs, knocking many offline around the world, causing flight and train cancellations and crippling some healthcare systems.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s Today Show in the US, Mr Kurtz said the incident was not a cyber attack, but admitted that despite CrowdStrike identifying the bug which sparked the issue and rolling out a fix, it would still be \u201csome time\u201d before all systems returned to normal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply sorry for the impact that we\u2019ve caused to customers, to travellers, to anyone affected by this,\u201d Mr Kurtz said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on with our customers all night and working with them \u2013 many of our customers are rebooting the system and it\u2019s coming up and operational because we fixed it on our end,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSome of the systems that aren\u2019t recovering, we\u2019re working with them, so it could be some time for some systems that just automatically won\u2019t recover, but it is our mission to make sure that every customer is fully recovered and we\u2019re not going to relent until we get every customer back to where they were and we\u2019ll continue to protect them and keep the bad guys out of their systems.\u201d\n\nAsked if he ever thought an outage of this scale was possible, the CrowdStrike founder added: \u201cSoftware is a very complex world and there\u2019s a lot of interactions, and always staying ahead of the adversary is a tall task.\u201d\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, Mr Kurtz reiterated that the outage \u201cwas not a security or cyber incident\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur customers remain fully protected,\u201d he said.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s stock tumbled in value when the US markets opened on Friday as investors digested the impact of the outage. Shares slid by over 8% at the start of trading, knocking around 10 billion US dollars (\u00a37.8 billion) off its market value. The largest financial markets in the US and UK fell during the trading session as other companies were also affected.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday was not a security or cyber incident. Our customers remain fully protected.\n\nWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can\u2026\n\n\u2014 George Kurtz (@George_Kurtz) July 19, 2024\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned that it could even take \u201cweeks\u201d for all computers and systems to be fully restored.\n\n\u201cThe fix will have to be applied to many computers around the world. So if computers are getting blue screens and endless loops, it could be more difficult and take days and weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Windows isn\u2019t the main OS for mission-critical systems, that\u2019s Linux \u2013 and so this could have been much worse.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike had earlier confirmed that Linux and Apple Mac systems had not been impacted by the bug.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called \u201cblue screen of death\u201d as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\nThe NHS is aware of a global IT outage and an issue with a GP appointment and patient record system.\n\nIf you have an appointment please do attend unless you are told otherwise. If you need help use 111 online or by phone and in an emergency call 999.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fhttps://t.co/M4QxHP2GqM\n\n\u2014 NHS England (@NHSEngland) July 19, 2024\n\nThe outage is \u201ccausing disruption in the majority of GP practices\u201d, NHS England said, and ambulance services also reported increases in calls from patients who are unable to contact other NHS providers because of the IT issues.\n\nThe health service said patients should attend appointments unless told otherwise and should only contact their GP in urgent cases.\n\nAcross England, GP surgeries reported being unable to book appointments or access patient records as their EMIS Web system went down.\n\nThe National Pharmacy Association said \u201cservices in community pharmacies, including the accessing of prescriptions from GPs and medicine deliveries, are disrupted today\u201d. Outages have affected flights (Jacob King/PA)\n\nIn an update on its website, Microsoft suggested users of virtual machines \u2013 a PC where the computer is not in the same place as the screen \u2013 turn their devices on and off again up to 15 times to help reboot the device and fix the issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d the tech giant said.\n\nIn the UK, Sky News briefly went off air on Friday morning and Britain\u2019s biggest train company warned passengers to expect disruption because of \u201cwidespread IT issues\u201d, as did many major airlines and airports.\n\nAround the world, banks, supermarkets and other major institutions reported computer issues disrupting services, while many businesses were unable to take digital payments or access key databases. Sky News was knocked off air (Sky News/PA)\n\nAt airports, flights were cancelled and staff forced to check in passengers manually on specific flights to help ease long queues.\n\nAnd one impacted airline, Ryanair, urged passengers whose flights have been cancelled to leave the airport.\n\nThe airline said in a statement: \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019ve been forced to cancel a small number of flights today due to this global third-party IT outage.\n\n\u201cAffected passengers have been notified and are advised to log into their myRyanair account once systems are back online to see their options.\n\n\u201cA full list of cancellations is available at ryanair.com. If your flight has been cancelled, we kindly request that you leave the airport as the IT outage means we cannot currently assist passengers at the airport.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this global third-party IT outage, and we are working hard to minimise disruption and keep passengers informed.\u201d\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f We are currently experiencing widespread IT issues across our entire network. Our IT teams are actively investigating to determine the root cause of the problem.\n\nWe are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, leading to potential short-notice cancellations,\u2026\n\n\u2014 Thameslink (@TLRailUK) July 19, 2024\n\nEarlier in the day, Govia Thameslink Railway \u2013 parent company of Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Northern \u2013 warned passengers to expect delays.\n\nGP practices across England warned they could not access EMIS Web,\u00a0the most widely used clinical system for primary care in the UK.\n\nIt enables GP practices to book appointments and examine records, and includes a clinical decision support tool as well as helping with admin.\n\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, the founding chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the incident was an \u201cincredibly powerful illustration of our global digital vulnerabilities and the fragility of core Internet infrastructure.\u201d\n\nProf Martin, who now works at the University of Oxford, said it was hard to estimate how long it would take to recover from the outage.\n\n\u201cThe underlying problem is fixed and the fixes are being implemented. Some industries can recovery quickly. But others like aviation will have long backlogs. That said, I\u2019d be surprised if we were still facing serious problems this time next week.\u201d\n\nHe added that the cyber industry also needed to \u201cget better\u201d at \u201cfinding and fixing these single points of failure across all core digital infrastructure\u201d and \u201cmanaging how we cope when IT services fall over\u201d, saying the world faced \u201cmore of these types of events\u201d if changes were not made.",

Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz posted on X on Friday that the fault had been identified and \u201ca fix has been deployed,\u201d adding that it wasn\u2019t a cyberattack. Compounding the issue, Microsoft also reported an apparently unrelated problem with its Azure cloud service.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud Software Outage: Live Updates\n\nHitting airlines, banks and healthcare systems, there have been few outages of this scale. The cascading failures underscore vulnerabilities of the modern economy and the central role of security software, which has deep access to operating systems.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, told Bloomberg News. \u201cThe economic impact is going to be huge.\u201d\n\nThe scale of the disruption reflects the enduring ubiquity of Microsoft\u2019s Windows, and the sizeable adoption of CrowdStrike\u2019s security software. Windows is installed on more than 70% of machines, according to StatCounter, and CrowdStrike is the global leader in modern corporate protection software, according to estimates by research firm IDC.\n\nAlthough its software is designed to thwart threats, CrowdStrike customers posted blue error screens to social media as they were prevented from accessing laptops and corporate computers.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc., and the LSE Group were among the major companies to disclose issues from communications to customer service. Airports from Singapore to Zurich were impacted. The New York subway said arrival information is unavailable for most of its lines, but services are operating. Bloomberg terminals were operating as normal.\n\nClick here for a liveblog on the outages.\n\nMicrosoft said it was \u201caware of an issue affecting Windows devices due to an update from a third-party software platform.\u201d The company said it fixed a separate glitch affecting Microsoft 365 apps.\n\nThe outages weighed on several sectors, including airlines, insurers and stock exchange operators. Shares in CrowdStrike sank 20%, while Microsoft fell 2.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPast disruptions have been less severe. In 2017, a series of errors within Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud service affected the operation of tens of thousands of websites. In 2021, issues at content delivery network Fastly took out several media networks including Bloomberg News and there were separate disruptions at Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud service.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history,\u201d Troy Hunt, an Australian security consultant and creator of the hack-checking website Have I Been Pwned, said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nThe first glitches emerged in the US late on Thursday and were blamed on the failure of Microsoft services Azure and 365, the company\u2019s internet-based office software suite.\n\nProblems linked to CrowdStrike then surfaced hours later in Asia and rippled across systems in Europe. As the US commute got underway, the New York subway said arrival information was unavailable but trains and buses were still running.\n\n--With assistance from Mayumi Negishi, Shona Ghosh, Kati Pohjanpalo, Celeste Perri and Danny Lee.\n\n(Updates throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Behind a massive IT failure that grounded flights, upended markets and disrupted corporations around the world is one cybersecurity company: CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGlobal IT Crash That Blocked 911 Calls and Grounded Planes Eases Zuckerberg Calls Trump\u2019s Response to Shooting \u2018Badass\u2019 Airlines Start Digging Themselves Out of Epic Flight Disruptions Canada\u2019s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can\u2019t All Stay Brookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO\n\nKnown as a dominant supplier of software that protects businesses from ransomware attacks, CrowdStrike was thrust into the spotlight on Friday as it struggled to fix a faulty patch that led to cascading, system-wide failures, paralyzing the operations of clients ranging from banks to global retail giants to health-care systems.\n\nWall Street\u2019s reaction to CrowdStrike\u2019s monumental gaffe was swift: Its shares tanked as much as 15% in New York trading on Friday, wiping out almost $8 billion of its market value. The company is still worth nearly $80 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike was founded by former executives of antivirus pioneer McAfee Inc. and launched in 2012. It has grown into the leading maker of a relatively new type of security software that\u2019s considered among the best defenses against ransomware and other hacking threats. It controls about 18% of the $8.6 billion global market for so-called \u201cmodern\u201d endpoint protection software, just ahead of archrival Microsoft Corp., according to market research firm IDC.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has bucked the broader trend in cybersecurity, with the firm reporting blockbuster earnings in its most recent quarter. Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz used the opportunity to take potshots at its larger rival, saying in June that CrowdStrike\u2019s technology \u201ccreates a wide competitive moat\u201d in the cyber sector, where Microsoft has $20 billion in annual revenue. After a US Department of Homeland Security report faulted Microsoft security failings, Kurtz said CrowdStrike had received an \u201coutpouring of requests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base,\u201d he said.\n\nThe type of software CrowdStrike supplies is separate and distinct from older, more limited types of security software. Traditional antivirus software was useful in the early days of computing and the internet for their ability to hunt for signs of known malware, but it has fallen out of favor as attacks have become more sophisticated. Now, products known as \u201cendpoint detection and response\u201d software that CrowdStrike develops do far more, continually scanning machines for any signs of suspicious activities and automating a response.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut to do this, these programs have to be given access to inspect the very core of the computers\u2019 operating systems for security defects. This access gives them the ability to disrupt the very systems they are trying to protect. And it is how Microsoft\u2019s Windows systems came into play in Friday\u2019s outage.\n\nRepresentatives of Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike confirmed online reports that a glitchy update was responsible for disabling potentially millions of corporate and government Windows computers around the world and causing the dreaded \u201cblue screen of death.\u201d\n\nThe company pegged the incident to \u201ca defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\u201d in a statement on Friday and said the outage wasn\u2019t down to a cyberattack or security breach. Anyone using a Mac or Linux machine isn\u2019t impacted, the company said, adding that \u201ca fix has been deployed.\u201d\n\nTo add to the confusion, an apparently separate incident involving Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud services also caused disruption on Friday. In a status update, Microsoft said it had fixed the underlying issue but that users would continue to experience \u201cresidual impact.\u201d\n\nWhile cybersecurity professionals say CrowdStrike\u2019s technology is a strong way to defend against ransomware, its cost \u2014 which in some cases can be more than $50 per machine \u2014 means that most organizations don\u2019t install it on all of their computers. What that means, however, is that the computers that have the software installed on them are among the most important to protect, and if they go down, key services can fall with them.\n\nNow that CrowdStrike\u2019s fix is out, any Windows desktop or laptop machine with the CrowdStrike product affected by the initial flawed update will need to be updated.\n\nHow laborious that process is will depend on whether CrowdStrike can roll out the fix automatically, or whether every machine will need to be manually rebooted. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, CrowdStrike\u2019s Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said the company was looking for ways to automate the steps involved, suggesting at least some customers are stuck with manual fixes for now. The company also has addressed the software update at the root of the issue, Kurtz said.\n\n\u201cIt was a content bug, or update, that we sent out and we\u2019ve identified, and that we\u2019ve rolled back,\u201d Kurtz said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. He apologized to affected customers, and said some systems would take a few hours to come back online while others would take longer.\n\nThat means affected entities - from banks to bourses to shipping ports - might take days to fully come back online, according to Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey.\n\n\u201cTo use the laptops, they\u2019ll have to manually intervene \u2014 that is a big job,\u201d Woodward said in an earlier interview with Bloomberg News.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of how the bad rollout happened to begin with.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is meant to keep these machines safe,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cThis is the sort of thing ransomware would do, but imagine ransomware simultaneously hitting the biggest organizations in the world \u2014 container ports in the Baltics, hospitals, railway stations, they\u2019ve all been hit at once because of this one little file.\u201d\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s customer base comprises large organizations that have a large number of remote machines to manage, he said. \u201cThe economic impact is going to be huge.\u201d\n\n(Updates with additional context in third, fourth, fifth and fourteenth paragraphs.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever Five Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris Why the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail Top Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview How Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Much of the world faced online disarray Friday as a widespread technology outage affected companies and services across industries \u2014 grounding flights, knocking banks and hospital systems offline and media outlets off air.\n\nAt the heart of the massive disruption is CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that provides software to scores of companies worldwide. The company says the problem occurred when it deployed a faulty update to computers running Microsoft Windows, and that the issue behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack.\n\nCrowdStrike has said a fix is on the way. Still, disarray continued hours after the problem was first detected.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow did Friday's global outage happen?\n\nFriday's chaos began with a faulty update was pushed out from CrowdStrike. In a Friday post on social media platform X, President and CEO George Kurtz cited a \u201cdefect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\u201d \u2014 noting that Mac and Linux hosts were not impacted.\n\nBut, because scores of companies rely on CrowdStrike for their security needs with Windows as their operating system, the consequences of this kind of technical problem are far-reaching.\n\nLong lines formed at airports in the U.S., Europe and Asia as airlines lost access to check-in and booking services during peak summer travel. Banks in South Africa and New Zealand reported outages impacting payments and online services. And hospitals had problems with their appointment systems, while officials in some U.S. states warned of 911 problems in their areas.\n\nDownDectector, which tracks user-reported disruptions to internet services, recorded that airlines, payment platforms and online shopping websites across the world were affected \u2014 although the disruption appeared piecemeal and was apparently related to whether the companies used Microsoft cloud-based services.\n\nStill, experts stress that Friday\u2019s disruptions underscore the vulnerability of worldwide dependence on software that comes from only a handful of providers.\n\n\u201cThis is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world\u2019s core internet infrastructure,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, a professor at Oxford University\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government and former Head of Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre.\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a U.S. cybersecurity company that provides software to companies around the world and across industries. It bills itself as being the globe's most advanced cloud-based security technology provider.\n\n\u201cWe stop breaches,\u201d the cybersecurity firm writes on its website.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the company's website, CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and launched in early 2012. CrowdStrike listed on the Nasdaq exchange five years ago. Last month, the Austin, Texas company reported that its revenue rose 33% in the last quarter from the same quarter a year earlier \u2014 logging a net profit of $42.8 million, up from $491,000 in the first quarter of last year.\n\nCrowdStrike has a partnership with Amazon Web Services and its \u201cFalcon for Defender\u201d security technology is designed to supplement Microsoft Defender to prevent attacks.\n\nIs there a fix?\n\nDisruptions on Friday have continued hours after CrowdStrike first identified the issue. But both the company and Microsoft say that they're working to get systems back online.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Crowdstrike said that it was \u201cactively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" \u2014 adding that a fix \u201chad been deployed\u201d for the identified issue.\n\nMicrosoft 365 posted on social media platform X that the company was \u201cworking on rerouting the impacted traffic to alternate systems to alleviate impact\u201d and that they were \u201cobserving a positive trend in service availability.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson Frank X. Shaw added in an emailed statement that the company was \u201cactively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\u201d Both CrowdStrike and Microsoft are also appearing to engage IT personnel on official online channels, such as Reddit.",

        "title": "Stocks to watch next week: Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon",
        "content": "As the second-quarter earnings season approaches, key companies worldwide will provide insights into sector performance. Investors will be particularly focused on updates from some of the 'Magnificent Seven', which will reveal whether the artificial intelligence (AI) trend continues.\n\nThe Mag 7 stocks have endured a challenging period, with the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) major players\u2014Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and AmazonAJa (AMZN)\u2014experiencing a dramatic decline in market capitalisation. Over recent sessions, these tech giants have collectively shed $1.128tn in market value, marking the largest such loss since May 2022.\n\nWill the upcoming earnings reports show strong performance or a lack of momentum? Here\u2019s what to watch for:\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nTesla shares have experienced a dramatic surge this month, with the company's stock price surging by 33%. This increase has propelled Tesla's market valuation by $209bn in the first eight trading days of the month alone, surpassing the combined market value of European automotive giants Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Stellantis, which stands at $198bn.\n\nThis surge cannot be attributed to Tesla\u2019s first-quarter financial results, which revealed the lowest quarterly profits since Q2 2021, diminishing cash flow, and rising inventory levels. The second-quarter production and delivery figures, released earlier this month, indicated a 14% year-on-year decline in vehicle production and a 5% drop in unit sales, although this may have contributed to reducing some of the inventory backlog.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cQuite what inspired this romp is hard to divine, barring ongoing investor enthusiasm for companies that are perceived as AI (and autonomous driving) plays, Elon Musk\u2019s courtroom victories at Tesla and X and ongoing hopes surrounding the Cybertruck, the supercharger network and the ride-hailing app,\u201d Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nFor the third quarter, the current consensus is sales of $25.7bn and that would signify a return to growth in the top line of some 10% year-on-year.\n\nAnalysts and investors are also paying close attention to Tesla\u2019s revenue composition. In the first quarter of 2024, energy storage, energy generation, and other business lines contributed 19% to total revenues, up from 10% in the same period in 2022.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) fell to $0.37 in Q1, but analysts expect a rebound to $0.62 in Q2, though this still marks a one-third decrease compared to the same period last year. The consensus EPS forecast for Q3 stands at $0.63.\n\nAJ Bell also highlighted Tesla's strong financial position, with a net cash reserve of $21.5bn. Although a few quarters of weak cash flow are not overly concerning, shareholders will be looking for improvements in this area as an indicator of higher profitability and a more streamlined balance sheet through inventory reduction.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July*\n\nMicrosoft Corp is set to report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 30, with analysts from Bank of America (BofA) forecasting potential revenue upside for the period.\n\nWall Street's consensus projects Microsoft to announce revenue of $64.2bn and earnings per share (EPS) of $2.90 for Q4. However, BofA analysts anticipate a 1% increase from their estimate of $64bn, indicating a 14% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by the robust performance of Azure, a premium mix in Office E3/E5, Copilot\u2019s initial success, and a stabilising PC/Windows market.\n\nAzure\u2019s growth is expected to remain balanced across sustained AI and core workloads, translating into a projected growth rate of 31.5%, slightly above the base expectation of 30.5%. The early traction of Copilot is also anticipated to bolster Office growth, maintaining its current valuation multiple.\n\nIn the more personal computing (MPC) segment, analysts foresee a $50m increase over the $15.5bn estimate, attributed to stronger-than-expected PC shipments.\n\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2025, BofA analysts predict continued double-digit revenue growth fuelled by ongoing strength in Azure and Office. However, they anticipate a 100 basis point decrease in margins due to increased capital expenditures driving higher cost of sales.\n\n\u201cIn an upside scenario, we believe the Office business could achieve 20% growth by Q1 fiscal 2026,\u201d the analysts noted.\n\nBofA has reiterated its \u2018buy\u2019 rating for Microsoft and raised the price target to $510 from $480, citing the potential for higher Office growth in fiscal 2025. They acknowledge that the current share price reflects a considerable amount of near-term upside.\n\n\"Microsoft is set to deliver fourth quarter results at some point next week. Investors will be hoping to see another strong showing from the cloud business, Azure. Analysts are looking for top line growth of 19.5% from Azure, which looks very achievable. Back in April, management said cloud-AI demand was outstripping supply. Despite a mammoth effort to build out compute, that supply/demand imbalance is likely to help underpin Azure growth for some time yet,\" Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.\n\n*Date not confirmed\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Tuesday 23 July\n\nThe parent company of Google (GOOGL), is set to announce its second-quarter earnings, with analysts predicting robust performance driven by its Android platform and continued momentum in its search and cloud businesses. The company's expanding generative AI capabilities are also anticipated to have significantly contributed to its positive results.\n\nFor Q2, the Zacks Consensus Estimate places Alphabet's revenues at $70.55bn, reflecting a 13.7% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at $1.85 per share, marking a 28.5% rise from the previous year's reported figures. This estimate has seen a slight upward revision of 0.5% over the past week.\n\nHowever, rising litigation issues and associated expenses remain areas of concern for the tech giant.\n\nOne key risk is the US Department of Justice's so-called adtech trial, in which the government charges that Google monopolises key digital advertising technologies, collectively referred to as the adtech stack. Website publishers depend on that stack to sell ads and advertisers rely on it to buy ads.\n\n\"As Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings approach, the M&A rumour mill is swirling. If reports are true and Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity firm Wizz for $23bn, it would mark a major move to beef up its security offering. Wizz has successfully taken on the likes of Microsoft and Palo Alto in the cyber space, taking market share over the past couple of years. Perhaps the biggest hurdle could be a regulator that\u2019s been a blocker for many large-scale deals \u2013 though a new team in the White House later this year could help things in that regard,\" Britzman said.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nBank of America Securities analyst Justin Post remains bullish on the integration of Google\u2019s AI chatbot.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive on growing Gemini integration across [the] Google ecosystem and think [the] broader rollout of AI overviews will likely help drive higher usage, while AI integration can increase monetisation across Google,\u201d Post said. \u201cMoreover, with a focus on expense management, we think year-over-year margin growth in 2024 will be a bright spot and potential EPS upside driver.\u201d\n\nPost affirmed a buy rating and $200 price target for Alphabet.\n\nBMO Capital Markets raised its their price target from $215 to $222, driven by potential gains in YouTube revenue.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 Reports second-quarter results on Thursday 25 July*\n\nAmazon is in the spotlight with a \"positive\" near-term view, as Morgan Stanley anticipates the e-commerce giant to significantly outperform in its Q2 earnings and provide optimistic guidance for Q3.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts project that Amazon will exceed consensus estimates for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by 17% for Q2 and 10% for Q3. This optimistic forecast is driven by enhanced profitability in North America tetail and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\n\"North America retail profitability and the accelerating growth of AWS are key factors behind our projections,\" the analysts noted.\n\nAs Amazon continues to leverage its robust retail operations and expand its cloud computing dominance, investors are looking forward to a strong financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIt is also a top pick for JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth both in the near and long term.\n\nHe anticipates a near-term acceleration in AWS, forecasting a 20% growth in Q4 2024. This growth is expected to be driven by easing optimisations, new workload migrations, and the ramping up of GenAI monetisation.\n\nRead more: UK to lose half a million millionaires by 2028\n\nAnmuth also projects a 190 basis point expansion in Amazon's North America operating income (OI) margin in 2024, supported by enhancements in shipping and inventory placement, increased automation, and stronger advertising revenue. Amazon's free cash flow is expected to reach $66bn in 2024 and $86bn in 2025.\n\nFor Q2, investors are looking for net sales to fall between $148bn and $150bn, with operating income ranging from $14bn to $15bn or more.\n\n\"There was also a strong showing from both the e-commerce and advertising segments over the first quarter, something investors will be keen to see continue. But markets were a little unhappy with the second quarter profit guidance of $10-14bn, anything toward the top end of that range will likely be met with a positive reaction,\" Britzman said.\n\n* Date not confirmed as the company might decide to announce results on 1 August.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 22 July\n\nMONY (MONY.L)\n\nAscential (ASCL.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ)\n\nNXP Semiconductor (NXPI)\n\nTuesday 23 July\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nCompass (CPG.L)\n\nMitie (MTO.L)\n\nSK Hynix (HY9H.MU)\n\nLVMH (MC.PA)\n\nASM International (ASM.AS)\n\nThales (HO.PA)\n\nLindt (LISN.SW)\n\nAlfa Laval (ALFA.L)\n\nLogitech (LOGNE.SW)\n\nNorsk Hydro (NHY.OL)\n\nAkzo Nobel (AKZOY)\n\nRandstad (RSH.DU)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN)\n\nGE Aerospace (GE)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nMondelez (MDLZ)\n\n3M (MMM)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM)\n\nMattel (MAT)\n\nWednesday 24 July\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RKT.L)\n\nUNITE (UTG.L)\n\nRHI Magnesita (RHIM.L)\n\nBreedon (BREE.L)\n\nAston Martin Lagonda (AML.L)\n\nPrimary Health Properties (PHP.L)\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nEasyJet (EZJ.L)\n\nOxford Nanopore (ONT.L)\n\nIberdrola (IBE.MC)\n\nBNP Paribas (BNP.PA)\n\nEquinor (EQNR)\n\nBanco Santander (BNC.L)\n\nUniCredit (UCG.MI)\n\nKering (KER.PA)\n\nDeutsche Boerse (DB1.DE)\n\nOrange (ORA.PA)\n\nMichelin (ML.PA)\n\nRepsol (REP.MC)\n\nMoncler (MOV.F)\n\nJer\u00f3nimo Martins (JMT.LS)\n\nCarrefour (CA.PA)\n\nSSAB (SSAB-A.ST)\n\nKindred (UNBA.MU)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nFord (F)\n\nNewmont (NEM)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nInternational Paper (IP)\n\nThursday 25 July\n\nRELX (REL.L)\n\nLloyds (LLOY.L)\n\nAnglo American (AAL.L)\n\nRentokil Initial (RTO.L)\n\nInforma (INF.L)\n\nCentrica (CNA.L)\n\nCentamin (CEY.L)\n\nHowden Joinery (HWDN.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nITV (ITV.L)\n\nHammerson (HMSO.L)\n\nVodafone (VOD.L)\n\nBT (BT-A.L)\n\nBritvic (BVIC.L)\n\nWorkspace (WKP.L)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nNestl\u00e9 (NESNE.SW)\n\nHerm\u00e8s (RMS.PA)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nChristian Dior (CDI.PA)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nEssilorLuxxotica (EL.PA)\n\nStellantis (STLA)\n\nENI (ENI.F)\n\nSt. Gobain (GOB.MU)\n\nRenault (RNO.PA)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nLinde (LIN)\n\nHoneywell (HON)\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NOC)\n\nKeurig-Dr Pepper (KDP)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV)\n\nBaxter (BAX)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nLiberty Global (LBTYK)\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG)\n\nFriday 26 July\n\nSEGRO (SGRO.L)\n\nIMI (IMI.L)\n\nRightmove (RMV.L)\n\nDrax (DRX.L)\n\nNEC (6701.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nAir Liquide (AI.PA)\n\nMercedes Benz (MBG.HA)\n\nHolcim (HOLN.SW)\n\nBASF (BASA.BE)\n\nCapGemini (CGM.HM)\n\nAlstom (ALO.PA)\n\nVallourec (VK.PA)\n\nKone Cranes (KNCRY)\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM)\n\nBristol Meyers Squibb (BMY)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Sanctioned Russia emerges unscathed in global IT outage",
        "content": "By Gleb Stolyarov\n\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian officials boasted on Friday that Moscow was spared the impact of the global IT systems outage because of its increased self-sufficiency after years of Western sanctions, though some experts said Russian systems could still be vulnerable.\n\nMicrosoft and other IT firms have suspended sales of new products in Russia and have been scaling down their operations in line with sanctions imposed over Russia's war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a special military operation.\n\nCrowdStrike, a U.S. cybersecurity company whose widely used \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash, had no known customers in Russia. The Russian market is dominated by local cybersecurity firms such as Kaspersky Labs.\n\n\"CrowdStrike has not provided any services in Russia, since February 2022 for sure,\" Mikhail Klimarev from the non-governmental Internet Protection Society told Reuters.\n\nThe Kremlin, along with companies from state nuclear giant Rosatom, which operates all of Russia's nuclear plants, to major lenders and airlines, reported no glitches amid the outage that affected international companies across the globe.\n\n\"The situation once again highlights the significance of foreign software substitution,\" Russia's digital development ministry said.\n\nRussian financial and currency markets also ran smoothly.\n\n\"Everyone has long been preparing for the possibility of being cut off from Microsoft due to sanctions. The current incident is a test of how well we have prepared. So far, everything is fine, at least for the major players, and generally, there is no panic in the market,\" one currency trader, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters.\n\nRussia's second-largest lender, VTB, announced plans to increase the share of domestically developed software to 95% by the end of this year, up from 85% currently. The bank said it invested 50 billion roubles ($571.46 million) this year alone in phasing out foreign software.\n\nHowever, IT expert Eldar Murtazin said the risks posed by insufficient testing of new software updates were universal, and Russian software was not necessarily immune to future glitches like the one that hit CrowdStrike.\n\n\"Such issues can happen to any software, whether Russian or non-Russian, if there are no proper controls over new releases. If such an outage had occurred 3-4 years ago, a number of Russian companies would have been affected,\" Murtazin told Reuters.\n\n($1 = 87.4955 roubles)\n\n(Reporting by Gleb Stolyarov; Writing by Gleb Bryanski; Editing by Peter Graff)",

        "title": "The Most Liveable Country in Asia in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024 and in this article, we will talk about the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, we are well aware of the consequences of climate change and hence, one of the most concerning factors that affect livability of a city is extreme heat as it increases discomfort and potentially also increases crime and traffic accidents, particularly in high humidity areas. Speaking of discomfort, the livability of cities in East Asia today is facing challenges due to extreme urban heat. In 2023, record-high temperatures exacerbated by climate change and the urban heat island (UHI) effect posed serious risks. On average, land surface temperatures in East Asian cities were 2.0\u00b0C warmer than nearby rural areas, with cities in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines experiencing up to 6.6\u00b0C higher temperatures. This disparity was particularly pronounced in poorer neighborhoods and is more severe at night due to heat retention by urban infrastructure.\n\nMoreover, according to the World Bank, over 100,000 deaths in East Asia are attributed to extreme heat annually. Economically, productivity losses from the UHI effect combined with global warming could reduce the GDP of major cities by 1.4-1.7% by 2050, with worst-case scenarios projecting an 11% loss by century's end. Speaking of GDP, let\u2019s look at the economic strength of Asia in general.\n\nThe Economic Strength of Asia in 2024\n\nIn 2024, Asia's economic growth is being fueled by tremendous developments in trade interconnectivity and technological innovation. Ccountries like India, China, and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are essentially leading this transformation. For example, we know that India's economy is expected to grow at 6.8% this year and its GDP is projected to surpass Japan's by 2025 and Germany's by 2030 and will eventually reach $7 trillion. On the other hand, China, despite a potential slowdown, is still projected to have a GDP $5 trillion higher in 2030 compared to 2022. Moreover, ASEAN's trade is anticipated to grow by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with exports increasing by nearly 90% by 2031.\n\nIt is also true that Asia's rise as a global tech and innovation hub is another important driver. The continent is becoming increasingly interconnected as manufacturing and sourcing are shifting to Southeast Asia with incredibly support provided by agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). By 2030, Asia\u2019s fintech revenues are expected to outpace those of North America. It is also worth highlighting that the region's consumers show a strong inclination toward artificial intelligence which also suggests near-term growth opportunities in tech sectors. Let\u2019s look at the recent developments of tech initiatives around Asia.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Growing Focus of the Big Giants in Asia\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has recently announced a major initiative to equip 2.5 million people in ASEAN countries with AI skills by 2025 to support the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025. The initiative aims to build an AI-ready talent pool across Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam and will involve partnerships with governments, nonprofit and corporate organizations. Over the past two years, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s Skills4Jobs program has already reached 1.7 million participants in the region. The AI TEACH programs by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in Indonesia and Malaysia target vocational students, while Thailand's AI Skills for the AI-enabled Tourism Industry program aims to train 100,000 young entrepreneurs. Additionally, in the Philippines, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to equip 1 million K-12 students with AI and cybersecurity skills.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) has also intensified its focus on social impact, particularly in the field of education and skill development for the region. In 2022, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 pledged to train 1 million women and girls in the Asia-Pacific region over five years as part of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Upskilling Initiative. This initiative was aimed at closing the gender gap in STEM fields and has already empowered nearly 650,000 women and girls through different educational programs. International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM)\u00a0 partnerships across the region, including collaborations with educational departments and organizations in Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, are central to this effort. The Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024\n\nIngus Kruklitis/Shutterstock.com\n\nIs the United Arab Emirates the Most Livable Country in Asia in 2024?\n\nIn order to identify the most livable countries in Asia in 2024, we utilized country ranking from the Human Development Index for the year 2022 and from the Numbeo\u2019s affordability index by Asian countries for the year 2023. We averaged the Asian countries\u2019 rankings for both these metrics and obtained an average rank to rank our list. The list is now presented in a descending order. Our methodology revealed that the UAE is indeed the most liveable country in Asia in 2024.\n\nThere are multiple major reasons that make the UAE such a preferred destination. First of all, the country has a tax-free income policy which is a major draw that allows residents to keep their entire earnings. This financial freedom is complemented by a stable economy diversified beyond oil which offers job opportunities across different sectors. Safety is another major factor as Dubai has one of the lowest crime rates globally.\n\nThe UAE has a population nearing 10 million which is predominantly composed of expatriates as the country provides a favorable standard of living. Economically, the UAE has rapidly evolved into one of the world's wealthiest countries within a span of just 50 years. With a high GDP per capita, driven largely by its oil reserves and strategic economic diversification efforts, the UAE has achieved impressive growth rates, averaging close to 4% annually since 2000.\n\nTo check out the extensive list of the most livable countries in Asia, please visit 20 Most Liveable Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best MBA programs; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Best-Performing Sector of the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The real estate sector has been one of the worst-performing parts of the stock market recently. Although the S&P 500 is up by 50% since the start of 2023, rebounding nicely from the 2022 bear market lows, the real estate sector, as indicated by the Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ), is up by just 6% in the same period. Even including dividends, real estate has underperformed the S&P 500 by 37 percentage points over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile this has certainly not been a fun time to be a real estate investment trust (REIT) investor, there's good reason to believe that things are about to turn around. With that in mind, here's why real estate has performed so poorly as a sector, why things might be about to get better for REITs, and why now could be a great time to get some exposure.\n\nWhy has the real estate sector performed so poorly?\n\nThe biggest reason real estate has underperformed is the rising-rate environment of the past couple years.\n\nWithout getting too deep into an economics lesson, the key point to know is that when risk-free interest rates rise (Treasury securities, for example), it tends to put pressure on income-oriented investments like REITs. Think of it this way: When instruments like Treasuries pay more, the yields investors expect from \"riskier\" investments tend to rise as well. Since yield and price have an inverse relationship, rising yields put downward pressure on REIT prices, even when the underlying business is doing well.\n\nNot only do rising rates generally put pressure on income-focused investments, but they also make it more expensive to borrow money. While this can affect businesses in all sectors, REITs tend to be more reliant than most on debt to grow their business, similar to how most homeowners use a mortgage when buying a home.\n\nIt also hasn't helped that the surge in AI investment has caused investor sentiment to shift in favor of massive tech stocks like Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). We've already started to see some money rotate out of the high-flying AI winners and into income-based stocks like REITs just based on recent inflation data, and this could accelerate once the Federal Reserve actually starts to cut rates.\n\nLast but certainly not least, we've seen some headwinds specific to certain property types. One big example is the communications REITs: American Tower(NYSE: AMT) and Crown Castle (NYSE: CCI). Both are experiencing a challenging growth environment, and since they're both among the largest REITs, they have a disproportionate drag on the index. Plus, some sectors have dealt with oversupply headwinds, such as office and self-storage real estate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCould a major turnaround be right around the corner?\n\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't raised interest rates in 2024, but investor expectations have certainly changed. At the beginning of the year, the median expectation was for a total of six rate cuts in 2024, but the inflation data and Fed officials quickly told a different story. And that's the biggest reason why real estate has underperformed so far this year.\n\nHowever, the latest inflation data indicates that it might actually be time for the Fed to start seriously considering rate cuts. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the first rate cut is clearly expected in September, a total of three are expected by the end of the year, and the median expectation is now for six total cuts by July 2025. In other words, the falling-rate cycle is set to begin -- just a little later than originally anticipated.\n\nAs rates fall, investor money could start to flow out of risk-free instruments like Treasuries, money market funds, and savings accounts, and into high-yielding stocks like REITs. And if the recent market activity is any indicator, we could also see a bit of a rotation out of the high-flying megacap tech stocks that have largely led the market's performance.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but...\n\nTo be perfectly clear, there's no way to know for sure how REITs will perform for the rest of 2024 and beyond, or if the Fed will actually start cutting interest rates. If inflation data for the next few months doesn't look great, it's entirely possible rates could stay higher for longer than expected.\n\nHaving said that, investing in REITs when the real estate sector is down by 25% from its all-time high, as it is now, has historically been a very strong entry point for long-term investors. There are some excellent values in individual REITs right now, but if you'd rather get broad exposure to the sector to hold for the long run, an ETF like the Vanguard Real Estate ETF could be a fantastic addition to your long-term portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Real Estate ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Real Estate ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vanguard Real Estate ETF wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Netflix, Trump nomination, outages - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Netflix will be in the spotlight Friday, after the streaming giant beat expectations of net subscriber additions but issued a cautious revenue guidance. Donald Trump accepted the Republican Party presidential nomination, while Wall Street looks set to end the week lower with a sectorial rotation under way.\n\n1. Netflix net adds ahead, revenue guidance cautious\n\nNetflix\u2019s third-quarter revenue guidance fell short of expectations, even as the streaming giant reported better-than-expected second-quarter results amid blowout subscriber additions, driven by a strong content slate and an ongoing crackdown on password sharing.\n\nThe mixed nature of these results, released after the market close Thursday, has resulted in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock trading largely unchanged premarket Friday. The stock has surged nearly a third so far this year.\n\nNetflix reported second-quarter earnings of $4.88 a share on revenue of $9.56 billion, topping estimates of $4.74 on revenue of $9.53 billion.\n\nThe streaming giant also raked in 8 million additional users in the quarter, well above the 4.8 million estimated, but below the 9.3 million seen in the previous three months.\n\nThe company had guided for lower net subscriber additions in the second quarter as it is facing saturation in the United States and plans to stop regularly reporting new subscriber additions next year.\n\nOn the flip side, the company guided for third-quarter revenue of $9.37 billion, missing estimates of $9.81 billion, and said its advertising business would not become a primary driver of revenue growth until at least 2026.\n\nInvestors have been looking at the company's relatively new advertising business as a potential source of growth.\n\n2. Futures slip amid a weekly rotation\n\nU.S. stock futures slipped lower Friday, continuing the previous session\u2019s weakness as the quarterly earnings season marches on.\n\nBy 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 75 points, or 0.2%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 9 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 60 points, or 0.3%.\n\nAll three major indices fell on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 500 points, ending a six-day winning run.\n\nLooking at the week as a whole, a market rotation appears to be taking place, with the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite down almost 3% and the S&P 500 1.3% lower, while the DJIA is up 1.7%.\n\nThe earnings continue to flow Friday, with results due from the likes of American Express (NYSE:AXP), Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) before the opening bell.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors will also have comments from Fed policymakers John Williams and Raphael Bostic to digest for clues about the future path of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy.\n\n3. Trump accepts nomination as Biden doubts rise\n\nDonald Trump formally accepted his nomination as the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidate at the Republican National Congress in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Thursday.\n\nHis nomination as the GOP candidate now sets him up for a potential rematch with President Joe Biden, who had beaten Trump in the 2020 elections.\n\nTrump was seen gaining a large boost in popularity after the assassination attempt last week.\n\nIn contrast, Biden was facing growing calls from the Democratic party members and donors to pull out of the presidential race after his weak performance in last month\u2019s debate with Trump.\n\nCritics of Biden have argued that his advanced age and tenuous health make him unfit to run for a second term.\n\nBiden is likely to drop his bid for reelection, TD analysts said in a note, adding that the Republican party had now realigned around Trump, and the Democrats could potentially lose the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhile the decision ultimately rests with Biden, we see him dropping his re-election bid as a question of when, not if,\u201d TD said.\n\n\u201cShould Trump win in a GOP sweep (House&Senate), we suspect he would read that as a MAGA mandate for his American First policies\u2026 we expect (a) potential 2nd Term to be all gas, no brake.\u201d\n\n4. Crowdstrike, Microsoft suffers major outages\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has suffered a major outage on Friday, affecting business all around the world, and tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has also experienced an outage, resulting in at least two low-cost U.S. airlines grounding flights.\n\nCrowdstrike said its outage resulted from an issue with the latest update, and the company is now in the process of rolling back that update globally.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor,\u201d the company said in a recorded message.\n\nMicrosoft reported an outage in its Azure cloud computing platform late-Thursday, with a note on the company\u2019s website attributing the Azure outage to a \u201cconfiguration change in a portion of our Azure backend workloads, caused interruption between storage and compute resources which resulted in connectivity failures that affected downstream Microsoft 365 services dependent on these connections.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s service health status website showed its 365 service was also experiencing \u201cdegradation,\u201d and that users will be unable to access several Microsoft 365 apps and services.\n\n5. Crude heads for weekly loss\n\nCrude prices fell Friday, heading for a weekly loss as a strong dollar and concerns about Chinese economic weakness weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nBy 04:15 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.5% to $80.91 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $84.89 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks are set for minor losses this week, their second consecutive losing week, after the dollar strengthened for the second consecutive session, hitting demand for dollar-denominated oil from investors holding other currencies.\n\nConcerns over sluggish demand in China, the world\u2019s biggest oil importer, remained front and center, following softer-than-expected growth figures for the second quarter.\n\nThe readings came after data last week showed a decline in China\u2019s oil imports in June.\n\nLimiting the week\u2019s losses this week has been the U.S. government reporting a bigger-than-expected weekly decline in oil stockpiles, suggesting consistent demand during the summer driving season.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNetflix, Trump nomination, outages - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean stocks slip, global IT outage causes chaos\n\nNeutral rate cannot determine monetary policy in India, says cenbank chief",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Friday amid persistent concerns over a renewed trade war between the U.S. and China, while positive earnings from TSMC did little to stop a rout in technology stocks.\n\nRegional markets took negative cues from their U.S. peers, as an extended rotation out of technology stocks sparked overnight losses on Wall Street. U.S. stock benchmarks tumbled from record highs over the past three sessions.\n\nU.S. stock index futures rose mildly in Asian trade, as a rout on Wall Street appeared to be somewhat easing. Focus also turned to a slew of key U.S. earnings due in the coming days, with majors including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) set to report.\n\nChinese stocks down on US trade jitters; stimulus hopes dampen losses\n\nChina\u2019s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell slightly on Friday, although they were trading above intraday lows.\n\nMedia reports this week suggested that the U.S. was considering stricter trade restrictions against China, especially the country\u2019s technology and chipmaking sectors.\n\nThe reports ramped up concerns over a renewed trade war between Beijing and Washington, given that trade relations between the two are already strained.\n\nSpeculation over a second Donald Trump presidency also dented Chinese stocks, given that Trump has maintained a largely negative rhetoric against Beijing.\n\nStill, losses in Chinese stocks were dampened by promises of more supportive policy from the Chinese government, as the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party carried on.\n\nTech rout persists, TSMC offers little support to chipmakers\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes were the worst performers in Asia, as the sector continued to grapple with profit-taking and as expectations of interest rate cuts sparked a broad pivot into economically sensitive sectors.\n\nLosses in tech dragged Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 down 0.4%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index slid over 2%.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI shed 1.5% on losses in chipmaking stocks.\n\nChipmaking stocks slid even as industry major TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) clocked stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, and upgraded its outlook on the prospect of strong demand from artificial intelligence.\n\nThe firm\u2019s Taipei shares fell 2%, as sentiment towards Taiwan was also rattled by comments from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Trump, who said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nBroader Asian stocks fell as sentiment remained dour. Concerns over China saw Australia\u2019s ASX 200 index slide 1.1%, with local stocks also seeing profit-taking after racing to record highs earlier in the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nJapan\u2019s TOPIX fell 0.6%, as softer-than-expected consumer price index data raised questions over whether the Bank of Japan will hike interest rates soon.\n\nFutures for India\u2019s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, as the index neared a record-high 25,000 points.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks fall as US-China jitters persist; TSMC sparks little cheer\n\nTSMC shares fall nearly 2% even after raising 2024 revenue forecast\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited",

Dow Jones Futures rose slightly to 40,985.0 points.\n\nTech stocks steady after bruising losses\n\nMajor technology stocks steadied in aftermarket trading, after clocking steep losses over the past two sessions. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose slightly in evening trade.\n\nA mix of profit-taking and a rotation into sectors more primed to benefit from an economic recovery had battered major technology stocks over the past two sessions.\n\nNetflix fell slightly in aftermarket trade after its second quarter earnings missed expectations.\n\nHeavyweight chipmaking stocks were also rattled by the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on China, especially on the country\u2019s chipmaking sector.\n\nLosses in tech sparked deep losses on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% at 5,544.59 points on Thursday. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.7% to 17,874.45 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.3% to 17,874.45 points.\n\nHeavyweight tech earnings on tap, TSMC supports chipmakers\n\nFocus was now squarely on key upcoming earnings from the tech sector next week. Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)are all set to report on Tuesday, with the two internet giants set to offer more cues on artificial intelligence after a massive valuation spike over the past year.\n\nTesla will be watched for how the electric car maker is navigating a steep decline in sales this year.\n\nPositive earnings from chipmaking bellwethers ASML (AS:ASML) Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) and TSMC (NYSE:TSM) aided chipmaking stocks on Thursday. TSMC rose slightly after it clocked stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with the world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker also hiking its outlook on strong AI-fueled demand.\n\nPolitical wrangling in focus as calls grow for Biden to exit race\n\nThe 2024 presidential race was also a point of focus for Wall Street, amid growing calls from members of the Democratic party for Biden to not seek re-election.\n\nReports on Thursday said former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi had told House democrats that Biden could be persuaded to exit the race.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns over Biden\u2019s health, coupled with the increasing popularity of Republican nominee Donald Trump, have sparked doubts over whether Biden will be able to clinch a second term.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as tech rout pauses; major earnings awaited\n\nEmbraer deliveries rise 88% in second quarter, order backlog at 7-year high\n\nFired Citigroup banker says COO intended to deceive regulator on bank's metrics\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Smartsheet Inc (NYSE:SMAR), the US-based creator of workplace collaboration software valued at $6.3 billion, lifted 5.5% during Thursday's regular session after reports that the company has engaged investment banking consultants following acquisition overtures from private equity firms, according to Reuters.\n\nThe Bellevue, Washington-based company is collaborating with Qatalyst Partners to evaluate propositions from private equity entities, according to these sources. Smartsheet has not yet determined if it will initiate a sale process, and it may choose to remain independent, they added.\n\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the situation. Both Smartsheet and Qatalyst declined to comment.\n\nPrivate equity firms have been aggressively seeking deals in industries such as technology and services this year, following a period of inactivity for most of 2023 due to high interest rates that made leveraged buyouts more difficult to finance. The first half of the year saw a 41% jump in private equity deal volumes, propelled by several take-private deals.\n\nSmartsheet's software provides organizations with a single platform to manage, monitor, and automate their workflows, offering a broader range of features and capabilities than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Excel. The company caters primarily to large corporate clients with complex operations, such as Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL), and services 85% of Fortune 500 companies, as per its website. Smartsheet's competitors, including Asana Inc (NYSE:ASAN) and Monday .Com Ltd (NASDAQ:MNDY), generally target smaller businesses.\n\nSmartsheet prioritizes growth over immediate profitability, achieving robust sales while incurring losses. However, the company has been progressively reducing these losses, improving its profit margins in the process.\n\nIn the fiscal year ending January 31, the company reported a revenue of $904 million, a significant increase from $714 million the previous year, and managed to cut its pre-tax losses from $213 million to $96 million. As of the end of April, the company had $334 million in cash reserves and no debt.\n\nBanks are typically hesitant to lend to companies that consume their cash flow, which can make leveraged buyouts more difficult for private equity firms to finance. As a workaround, some private equity firms have sought financing from so-called shadow banks, investment firms that operate outside the traditional banking sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese lenders are not subject to banking regulatory oversight and can provide loans based less on a company's cash flow and more on its generated sales, often referred to as an annual recurring revenue loan.\n\nHowever, this type of debt carries inherent risks. For instance, private equity firm Vista Equity is reportedly in discussions to relinquish control of its educational software platform, Pluralsight (NASDAQ:PS), to its lenders following a souring of the annual recurring revenue loan it took on after its $3.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSmartsheet spikes as company considers buyout offers - Reuters\n\nAfter-hours movers: Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, and more\n\nSelective Insurance shares fall 7% after reporting Q2 loss",

These are some of the best known, and most popular, companies.\n\nAll eyes will be on these five for a variety of reasons. Several are part of the Magnificent 7. Many investors own those 7 large cap stocks. But several others are simply popular growth stocks that have hit new all-time highs in 2024.\n\nQ2\u2019s Must-See Earnings Reports\n\nWhat will they say about the US, and global, economies? Is the recession here or will the Fed achieve a soft landing?\n\nSeveral companies are booming thanks to the AI revolution. Will AI still be a driver of earnings and sales in Q2?\n\nWhile there are a lot of companies that people will be tuning into during this earnings season, these 5 are the most important of all. You won\u2019t want to miss them.\n\nThe 5 Most Important Stocks to Watch During Q2 Earnings Season\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apple Inc. (AAPL) has surprised on earnings 5 quarters in a row. In fact, it has a great earnings surprise track record with just 1 miss in the last 5 years and that was in early 2023.\n\nApple shares are up 19% year-to-date and are hitting all-time highs. Yet Apple trades at 35x forward earnings. Is Apple too hot to handle?\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) has beat 4 quarters in a row. That is a turnaround from a string of misses in 2021 and 2022.\n\nEli Lilly has been one of the hottest stocks on the Street. It is up 55.4% year-to-date. Eli Lilly is trading with a high valuation, as it has a forward P/E of 70. Will Eli Lilly continue to execute?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. It also has a solid 5-year earnings surprise track record, with just 3 misses during that time. That is impressive given the pandemic.\n\nShares of Chipotle are up 21% year-to-date and hit new all-time highs. However, Chipotle isn\u2019t cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 51. Can Chipotle continue with the 20%+ earnings growth this quarter?\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has a great earnings surprise record. Microsoft has beat 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed once in the last 5 years and it was in 2022.\n\nMicrosoft shares hit new all-time highs in 2024. It is up 18% year-to-date. Microsoft isn\u2019t cheap, however. It trades at 34x forward earnings. Will AI prove to be another catalyst for Microsoft in Q2?\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) has an excellent earnings surprise track record. It\u2019s beat 4 quarters in a row. Super Micro Computer has only missed once since 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer have been red-hot in 2024, gaining 187% year-to-date on the AI trade. It reports earnings in Aug 2024. Super Micro is trading at 26x. Is Super Micro Computer a good bellwether of what\u2019s to come with the other AI stocks this earnings season?\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Microsoft's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership Insiders have been selling lately\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$169b last week. However, the 26% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Microsoft  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Microsoft. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Microsoft\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Microsoft has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "3 Affordable Cloud Stocks to Watch in July",
        "content": "Believe it or not, quite a few cloud stocks out there don\u2019t cost a small fortune to punch your ticket to. Several enterprise and consumer cloud companies haven\u2019t yet felt the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) tailwind all too strongly, especially versus the likes of your average semiconductor heavyweight. And it\u2019s unclear if they will anytime soon, with infrastructure software spending markedly softer than hardware spend.\n\nAs top hardware companies become fully priced, investors looking for \u201cdeals\u201d in the gen AI universe may wish to check in with some fairly-priced cloud before the herd catches on.\n\nUndoubtedly, we could see IT investing turn from hardware to software once firms have had their fill of chips. Indeed, stockpiling GPUs, memory, servers, and other related hardware represents only one piece of the AI puzzle for firms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough the timing of AI-induced earnings surges seems somewhat less certain for many cloud stocks, they could have the potential to be sudden and sizable in magnitude. Here are three names that look intriguing this July.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a cloud darling that\u2019s fully invested in gen AI. Though there are formidable and fast-moving rivals in the AI image and video generation market, Adobe has excellent managers who can lead it into the AI age. Indeed, Adobe\u2019s move into the cloud has paid off big time. And so, too, should its deep dive into the AI waters.\n\nWith AI integration, Adobe stands to enable the masses to be pro-level creators. Indeed, only so many people know how to use Photoshop well. However, with gen AI taking care of the tedious details while allowing users to fine-tune their creations, the firm stands to expand upon its total addressable market significantly.\n\nIn essence, anyone who can type into a prompt can have the capability of a designer when equipped with AI, which will become even more intelligent as time goes on.\n\nGiven how Adobe is leveraging AI software, I view ADBE stock as a cheap cloud stock while going for 30.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). Shares are up around 29% from their early-June lows and could be headed much higher if it executes its AI plans.\n\nAtlassian (TEAM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Australian software company Atlassian Corporation (TEAM) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAtlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is another cloud-based AI software firm that can profoundly boost user productivity. The Australian company behind industry-leading project management software can create much incremental value by rolling out AI across its application suite.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow down more than 60% from its 2021 all-time high, TEAM stock looks like one of the cheaper cloud stocks for investors seeking AI innovation and growth at a reasonable price. Of course, there are notable headwinds, but I think they mostly distract from the longer-term opportunity in cloud migration and gen AI.\n\nEarlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Rob Owens upgraded TEAM stock to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cneutral\u201d and raised his price target by 12.5% ($200 to $225). He views a \u201cfavorable\u201d risk-reward at current valuations. At 55.5 times forward P/E, the stock is no steal. However, if management can hit its new financial goals, the beaten-down cloud stock may be one of the best opportunities in tech.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google headquarters in Mountain View, California.\n\nSource: achinthamb / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) made headlines this past week when it announced it\u2019s close to inking a $23 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz. In light of the massive breach at AT&T (NYSE:T), investors seem to welcome such a deal.\n\nUndoubtedly, GOOG stock has been on an incredible run in the past year, but the cloud stock\u2019s rally may be in its earlier innings. As the cloud firm beefs up its cybersecurity prowess via the Wiz acquisition and its own innovations, Google\u2019s cloud customers can feel safe knowing their data is in excellent hands.\n\nAdditionally, as Google advances its AI strategy in the cloud, Alphabet may just be able to rise in the standings of the public cloud race. Indeed, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure is leading the charge with its AI prowess. But Google Cloud certainly has the AI chops to pick up the pace. At just 28.4 times forward P/E, GOOG stock reeks of relative value.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held a long position in GOOG and MSFT.

        "title": "2 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Stocks that can survive and thrive for long periods -- say, beyond 20 years -- are a special breed. These companies typically display one or several of the following characteristics: innovative abilities, leadership in a major industry, a strong moat, or exciting growth potential. That's not an exhaustive list of traits such corporations can have, but they are among the most important.\n\nTo find businesses that display them, it can be helpful to start by looking at companies that have already passed the test of time. Let's look at two examples: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Abbott Laboratories(NYSE: ABT). Beyond the strong prospects they offer, these two well-known businesses are also excellent dividend payers worth holding on to for good.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nFew companies are more popular than Microsoft. That's an important advantage in and of itself -- it means the company's brand is well known and enjoys relatively high consumer trust.\n\nMicrosoft has become synonymous with many of the services it offers. No company gets close to its share of the computer operating system market. Microsoft's productivity tools are the norm for millions of people and businesses, many of which rely on them for their day-to-day activities; that arguably grants Microsoft high switching costs, a potent competitive edge.\n\nStill, Microsoft's OS business isn't much of a growth machine anymore. Thankfully, the company has other exciting opportunities: cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft is second only to Amazon in the cloud market, though the latter has been closing in on the former.\n\nAI is providing yet another vital boost to Microsoft's cloud business. The company also benefits from switching costs in this field. Microsoft is a leader in every field in which it operates, whether in AI, cloud computing, computer OS, or gaming.\n\nThat's excellent evidence that the company is incredibly innovative, an important reason it has performed well over the years. MSFT Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nEverything points to Microsoft still delivering strong financial performances and market-beating returns in the long run. Note the company's free cash flow: $70.58 billion.\n\nA company's ability to generate strong free cash flow isn't just a sign of a robust underlying business. It also allows it to invest in more growth opportunities. Beyond those Microsoft is currently pursuing, the company will undoubtedly find more.\n\nAnd here's another piece of evidence of the company's strong business: Microsoft boasts an AAA rating from Standard & Poor's. That's a higher rating than the U.S. government itself.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat about Microsoft's dividend? The company's yield isn't impressive; it's just 0.66%. However, the tech giant has increased its payouts by 168% in the past 10 years. Its cash payout ratio of 30.11% is conservative -- perhaps too conservative. Microsoft has ample room for more increases.\n\nDividend investors can't go wrong with Microsoft, nor can those looking for reliable corporations to invest in for good.\n\n2. Abbott Laboratories\n\nDeveloping innovative medical technologies is a surefire way to survive for a long time. In that department, there aren't many companies with a better track record than Abbott Laboratories.\n\nThe medical device giant has a long lineup of products across its cardiovascular and diabetes care segments. Abbott Laboratories' FreeStyle Libre franchise, a series of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems that help diabetics track their blood glucose levels, has been the company's biggest growth driver in recent years. The company highlighted that the FreeStyle Libre is now the most successful medical device in history in terms of dollar sales.\n\nBeyond medical devices, Abbott Laboratories' nutrition, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals segments grant it significant diversification. Abbott Laboratories holds patents that protect its devices from being knocked off, at least for the duration of the patent, an important competitive advantage for companies across many industries, including healthcare.\n\nHere's another critical moat source for Abbott Laboratories: The company has successfully navigated the highly regulated healthcare sector for a long time. It knows its way around and has developed a brand name people trust. That's one reason Abbott Laboratories has performed exceptionally well. ABT Revenue (Annual) Chart\n\nWith the world's aging population, the severely underpenetrated diabetes market -- just 1% of adults with the disease in the world have access to CGM technology -- and many other opportunities, Abbott Laboratories can still deliver superior returns.\n\nAbbott Laboratories is also an exceptional dividend stock. It has increased its payouts for 52 consecutive years. It might not be the most exciting business, but it looks reliable enough to sustain strong returns and growing payouts for a long time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Why small caps are showing up the tech titans: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSmall caps are solving Wall Street's concentration problem.\n\nThough small caps stumbled Wednesday, in the five prior trading days, the Russell 2000 (^RUT) rocketed an eyewatering 12% as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) barely remained green. It was a surge that had never been surpassed by any of the major US stock indexes, according to Bespoke.\n\nThe catalyzing event was last week's dovish Consumer Price Index, which reported an actual decline in prices of 0.1%. The sign change in inflation was enough to convince holdouts on Wall Street that there's more to stocks in 2024 than the well-known cadre of tech titans riding the artificial intelligence wave.\n\nBut laggards are once again turning to leaders, bringing to mind the \"everything rally\" that dominated the fourth quarter last year.\n\nAs the Magnificent titans wilt, smaller pockets of strength fill the leadership void. Sector rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets, they say. Tech stocks led by megacaps have caused the Nasdaq 100 to underperform since last Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 (not shown) soared 12%.\n\nSince last Tuesday's close, Real Estate has led the large-cap sectors, up 7%. On its heels, cyclicals and values are well represented \u2014 as Materials, Industrials, Energy, and Financials are all up about 5%.\n\nThe only two losers are also the highest-returning sectors for the year \u2014 Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) \u2014 down 4% and 2%, respectively.\n\nDelving into the financial sector, we see the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) has now clawed its way back to the drop-off point from last year's internet bank crisis. The 16% surge is a notable move for regionals, which have had a rough two years since their 2022 highs.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) also jumped more than 14% on Monday, and notched its first record high since March.\n\nWhile the prospect of tamer inflation is behind much of the move, Trump's surge in popularity after the weekend assassination attempt is also a factor. Investors believe banks will benefit from a lighter regulatory touch, and the steepening yield curve over the last week also helps.\n\nThen there's crypto. For all the talk about spot ether ETFs, the bitcoin halving, and Gary Gensler, Trump's crypto support has helped bring bitcoin (BTC-USD) back from a nasty sell-off that might have had bearish legs.\n\nAfter all the gyrations over the last week, the two leading sectors in 2024 remain Tech and Communication Services \u2014 each holding on to gains of about 17%. But the handwringing over concentration can finally take a breather \u2014 at least, for now.\n\nStory continues morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Tech stocks led the market in the first half of 2024, and there is no reason they can't continue leading the market into the future. Artificial intelligence (AI) appears to be a game changer that should help power the sector higher in the years to come.\n\nLet's look at three tech stocks to buy this year and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNo company has benefited more from the increased interest in AI than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), whose graphic processing units (GPUs) are being used to harness the power of AI in the data center. The company has created a stranglehold on the GPU market through its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform that long ago became the industry standard for programming GPUs before AI became the next big thing.\n\nWith developers trained on its software platform, it has become difficult for other chipmakers to make a dent in Nvidia's dominance, and there does not appear to be anything on the horizon to challenge its market-leading position. At the same time, the company sped up its innovation cycle to further widen its lead, looking to push out new GPU architecture platforms almost every year.\n\nThe company's growth has been nothing short of spectacular, with its first-quarter revenue soaring 262% year over year to $26 billion. While that level of growth is unsustainable, demand for many of its chips outstrips supply, and customers are still in the early days of building out their AI infrastructures. This should continue to lead to strong growth in the years to come.\n\nAt the same time, given its growth, the stock is reasonably priced at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 47 times. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nWhile Nvidia has been at the forefront of AI on the chip side, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has been the AI leader on the cloud computing and software side. Through its partnership with and investment in OpenAI, Microsoft has incorporated AI throughout its various offerings.\n\nIts Azure cloud-computing business has been the biggest beneficiary of AI thus far, as shown by the segment's revenue jumping 31% year over year last quarter. This is a pay-as-you-go business where customers pay only for the resources they use, and that usage has been soaring as clients use the Azure platform to build their own AI solutions. The company has seen deals getting bigger, with Azure deals worth more than $10 million last quarter doubling and $100 million-plus deals up 80%.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's introduction of AI assistant Copilots is helping power other parts of its business as well. Its GitHub Copilot, which can make suggestions to help complete coding, helped power a 45% increase in revenue for its developer platform GitHub segment. The company is also using AI in its Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn offerings, which helped drive 14% and 29% year-over-year revenue growth, respectively, in each segment last quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading at a forward P/E of under 34 times, the stock's valuation is consistent with where it has traded over the past five years. Given the growth potential from AI in front of it, this is a solid stock to buy at current levels. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\n3. DocuSign\n\nWhile Nvidia and Microsoft have been early AI leaders, DocuSign(NASDAQ: DOCU) has the potential to be a later AI beneficiary. The company known for its e-signature solution has witnessed its growth slow as it saw a lot of pull forward in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then saw one of its biggest end markets, residential real estate, come under pressure.\n\nHowever, this company has a cash-rich balance sheet and generates a lot of free cash flow. At the same time, with its new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) solution, it is looking to combine its e-signature and contract lifecycle management (CLM) products to become a platform company.\n\nIt will also begin incorporating AI technology into its new IAM platform, which it obtained from its recent acquisition of AI-powered agreement-management software company Lexion. The company has already introduced a number of new features to be included in IAM, such as Maestro, which can create agreements without coding, and Navigator, which can store and analyze a customer's agreement databases. DOCU PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nTrading at a forward P/E ratio under 18 and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple of under 12, the stock is attractively valued, given its leading position in the e-signature market and potential growth drivers with its new IAM solution.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose in evening deals on Wednesday, steadying after a rout in chipmaking stocks, on concerns over more trade disruptions, sparked steep losses on Wall Street.\n\nGrowing bets on early interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve also spurred a broader pivot away from technology stocks and into more growth-sensitive sectors. This saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surge to record highs even as its Wall Street peers lagged.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.2% to 5,652.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.3% to 20,067.0 points by 20:43 ET (00:43 GMT). Dow Jones Futures rose 0.2% to 41,589.0 points.\n\nChip stocks rise after China fears, Trump comments spur steep losses\n\nHeavyweight technology and chipmaking stocks rose in aftermarket trade after clocking outsized losses during the session.\n\nHeavyweights such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 1% after a 6.6% slide, while TSMC (NYSE:TSM) rose 2.4% after a nearly 8% tumble. Majors such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also steadied after falling during the session.\n\nReports that the Biden administration was considering more export curbs on China, particularly in chipmaking technology, battered the sector, given that it could herald lower sales in China, which is a major consumer of chips.\n\nConcerns over heightened geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan dented chip stocks, after Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense supplies.\n\nTech stocks were also pressured by a broader shift into more economically sensitive sectors, amid growing bets that the Fed will begin cutting rates from September.\n\nThis saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.6% to a record high of 41,198.08 points. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to 5,588.27 points, while the NASDAQ Composite finished down 2.8% at 17,997.81 points.\n\nNetflix, TSMC earnings awaited\n\nFocus remained on the second quarter earnings season, with technology majors Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and TSMC set to report earnings on Thursday.\n\nTSMC is considered a bellwether for the chipmaking industry, and is expected to log a bumper second quarter profit on increased demand from the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nLithographic equipment maker ASML Holding NV (AS:ASML) ADR (NASDAQ:ASML), which is also considered a bellwether for the chip industry, clocked stronger than expected second quarter earnings, as it flagged increased demand from the AI industry.\n\nEarnings from Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX), Alaska Air Group Inc (NYSE:ALK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc (NASDAQ:ISRG) are also due on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures rise as chip rout eases; more earnings awaited\n\nAustralia's Domino's Pizza slumps to over 9-year low on bleak store growth view\n\nInsurance broker TWFG prices US IPO above range to raise about $187 million\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The technology sector continues to be one of the most desired industries for investors. Its rapid innovation has created some of the world\u2019s most valuable companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWith the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI), fintech and cybersecurity, finding the best tech stocks to buy is a great strategy. While these industries can help investors grow their wealth, it is important to understand the risks. There are thousands of tech companies listed on the stock market, and many of them do not pan out.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for investors to be extremely selective and stick with the company\u2019s with long track records of success. This can be through a combination of market share, revenue and earnings growth and consistent cash flows. While past performance is not indicative of future results, investing in the technology sector is a great way to build wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are the top three tech stocks to buy to 10X your money in the long term!\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a leading fintech stock with enormous long term potential. The company\u2019s investments in digital transformation, which includes digital payment solutions, position it well for long-term success.\n\nAmerican Express is undoubtedly one of the best tech stocks to buy in 2024. Over the last year, its revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth, boosted by strong customer engagement and demand for its premium product offerings. In 2023, new card acquisitions totaled 12.2 million, bringing its total network to over 140 million. CEO Stephen Squeri remains confident in the investments it is making in areas like digital wallets and tokenization to expand its customer base in 2024. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion. New card acquisitions hit a record 3.4 million in the quarter, with earnings per share up 39% to $3.33 per share. With a clear focus on the millennial and Gen Z segments, AXP stock is uniquely positioned to benefit from the resurgence in travel demand in 2024 and beyond.\n\nGodaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) is a leading domain registrar and web hosting company. It is also a tech company with extraordinary long-term potential. As more businesses migrate to online, Godaddy will continue to dominate and grow its revenue, earnings and market share.\n\nGodaddy is among the best tech stocks to buy and hold for the long haul. The company hit a key inflection point in 2023, instilling confidence in the business moving forward. While revenue increased a modest 4% from 2022, its strong operational execution drove its earnings and free cash flow to record heights. Moreover, net earnings swelled 295% year over year to $1.4 billion, with free cash flow up 11% to $1.1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, momentum continued to build with earnings up 749% year-over-year to $401.5 million. Additionally, Godaddy continues to diversify its product offerings including its new Airo platform that includes a full suite of AI tools. With the company recently added to the S&P 500, the sky is truly the limit for this under-the-radar tech giant.\n\nQualys (QLYS) A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) is a provider of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. It, too, is one of the top tech stocks to buy to grow your wealth. With cyber-crimes accelerating, Qualys is a compelling investment opportunity that you can\u2019t miss.\n\nQualys provides customers with a broad range of cybersecurity solutions, including vulnerability management, threat detection and compliance. With the increased frequency and boldness of cyber attacks, businesses of all sizes will need more robust security measures. The company\u2019s cloud-based solutions and TruRisk platform is uniquely positioned to address these challenges.\n\nFurthermore, Qualys\u2019 growing revenue, earnings and free cash flow is a positive sign for the business. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $554.5 million. Earnings per share rose 47% from the year prior, with free cash flow hitting a record $236 million. Additionally, revenue and earnings saw strong double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2024. With cyber-crimes remaining a pressing problem in business, Qualys will continue to benefit from the rise in cybersecurity spending.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Big AI\u2019s \u2018reverse acqui-hire\u2019 deals get more scrutiny in the U.K. and U.S.",
        "content": "When Microsoft dropped its observer seat on OpenAI\u2019s board last week\u2014and Apple abandoned reported plans to gain such a seat\u2014the uptick in regulatory scrutiny around the AI sector was a clear culprit. And the scope of that scrutiny just widened further.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, yesterday gave notice that it\u2019s in the early stages of probing Microsoft\u2019s March hiring of key staff from AI startup Inflection, which came with $650 million in licensing fees for Inflection.\n\nThe hired crew included Inflection cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft\u2019s in-house AI efforts. This seemed to be a case of Microsoft trying to avoid becoming over-reliant on OpenAI, into which it has invested $13 billion for a profit share. But authorities also want to check that the nature of the deal (a so-called reverse acqui-hire, as a more traditional acqui-hire would involve buying the company) wasn\u2019t also a tactic to sidestep antitrust rules that might be more clearly triggered by a straightforward acquisition.\n\nThe CMA\u2019s initial probe formally begins today, and the watchdog will decide by Sept. 11 whether to press on with a proper merger investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reports that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2014which has already been nosing around the Microsoft-Inflection deal since early June\u2014is also asking questions about Amazon\u2019s deal with AI startup Adept late last month.\n\nThis was a very similar arrangement, with CEO David Luan and other key Adept players joining Amazon and Amazon paying Adept to license its technology. One might also see a parallel between Microsoft\u2019s earlier OpenAI investment and Amazon\u2019s earlier investment of $4 billion into OpenAI rival Anthropic.\n\nApart from the difference in dynamics stemming from the fact that OpenAI is so far a much bigger name than Anthropic, there does seem to be a playbook here, and it\u2019s no surprise that U.S. and U.K. (and EU) regulators would like to know if rules are being skirted. U.S. lawmakers are certainly upset about the trend. \u201cA few companies control a major portion of the market, and just concentrate\u2014rather than on innovation\u2014trying to buy out everybody else\u2019s talent,\u201d complained Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Or.) last week.\n\nIncidentally, there are also a couple more interesting news tidbits out there about AI regulation.\n\nFirst, King Charles III announced today that the U.K.\u2019s new Labour government will \u201cseek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models\u201d\u2014a big shift from the previous Conservative government\u2019s hands-off approach.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, with the EU now having officially published its own AI Act\u2014its rules on model-makers will begin to apply from February next year\u2014European privacy regulators said yesterday that they would be the right ones to enforce the new law in many cases. \u201cI strongly believe that [data protection authorities] are suitable for this role because of their full independence and deep understanding of the risks of AI for fundamental rights, based on their existing experience,\u201d said Irene Loizidou Nicolaidou, deputy chair of the watchdogs\u2019 umbrella body, the European Data Protection Board, in a statement.\n\nOf course, AI has been a big theme at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech conference in Park City, Utah, this week, as my colleague Jeremy Kahn wrote yesterday. I was particularly intrigued by Jeremy\u2019s chat with Google chief scientist Jeff Dean, who warned against people overplaying AI\u2019s role in his company\u2019s rising carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of focus on the increasing energy usage of AI, and from a very small base that usage is definitely increasing,\u201d Dean said. \u201cBut I think people often conflate that with overall data center usage\u2014of which AI is a very small portion right now but growing fast\u2014and then attribute the growth rate of AI-based computing to the overall data center usage.\u201d\n\nA fair point, for now. But I think the criticisms of AI\u2019s massive hunger for energy will remain valid until companies like Google and Microsoft can prove that rolling it out doesn\u2019t mean deviating from their emissions-reduction goals.\n\nA few more articles based on yesterday\u2019s Brainstorm Tech action:\n\nHow trust and safety leaders at top tech companies are approaching the security threat of AI: \u2018Trust but verify\u2019\n\nWhy Grindr\u2019s CEO believes \u2018synthetic employees\u2019 are about to unleash a brutal talent war for tech startups\n\nSalesforce\u2019s AI chief says the company uses its Einstein products internally: \u2018We like to drink our own martinis\u2019\n\nHow VCs from Alphabet\u2019s CapitalG to Norwest are coping with a dead IPO landscape: \u2018We\u2019re not here to time the market\u2019\n\nSequoia\u2019s Roelof Botha says Silicon Valley\u2019s legendary VC firm will not take a political point of view on the election\n\nRent the Runway cofounder Jennifer Fleiss on why cofounder relationships are critical for mental wellness in the startup game\n\nTech talent and killer powder: The recipe that startups say is fueling the rise of Utah\u2019s Silicon Slopes\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Carbon Capture Stocks Cleaning Up Their Act",
        "content": "The carbon capture and sequestration market is expected to have a steady growth trajectory, which will be a boon for carbon capture stocks. This growth is being spurred by the enhanced efforts being made by the governments and the corporations in cutting down on CO2 emissions with a view of hitting the net-zero targets.\n\nNew innovations in the carbon capture technologies are improving the ways of capturing and storing carbon dioxide. Better technologies like Direct Air Capture, which captures CO2 from the atmosphere, are being seen more frequently.\n\nThese advancements are improving the efficiency of carbon capture, which, in turn, is increasing the interest in this area and the funding being put into it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, we\u2019re going to see an increase in investor appetite for carbon capture stocks moving forward. So here are three companies for investors to consider adding to their portfolios.\n\nExxonMobil (XOM) XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some Time\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has developed an elaborate plan to tackle carbon emissions and facilitate the shift towards the usage of cleaner energy through a number of CCS projects.\n\nXOM\u2019s hydrogen production plant is one of the cornerstones of ExxonMobil\u2019s CCS projects. This initiative will generate as much as 1 billion cubic feet of \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen every day, alongside the mechanisms for storing up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 a year.\n\nThis project is expected to cut the complex\u2019s CO2 emissions by at least 30%, and therefore contribute to ExxonMobil\u2019s objective of delivering net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from operated assets by 2050.\n\nExxonMobil annually captures about 9 million metric tons of CO2 and has captured over 120 million metric tons capturing a market share of about 40% of all the human-produced CO2 annually.\n\nThis positions XOM as one of those carbon capture stocks making a huge pivot in their operations from the traditional oil industry.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother company that has taken part in CCS projects with the aim of cutting its carbon footprint is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). The company\u2019s subsidiary, 1PointFive, is instrumental in this regard as it concentrates on the scaling up of DAC technologies.\n\nThe STRATOS DAC facility in Texas is one of the key projects under 1PointFive. This is a world-class plant with the capacity of capturing 500,000 metric tons of CO2 every year, thus, offering a long term solution to curbing carbon emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCollaborations with companies like\u00a0AT&T (NYSE:T) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are reportedly in place as these organizations have invested in the purchase of carbon removal credits.\n\nOXY highlights how organizations are able to leverage carbon capture for shareholders and not purely an expectation of them or an altruistic exercise, offering real incentives to clean up one\u2019s act. This makes it one of those carbon capture stocks to buy.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) leverages its solid-oxide fuel cell platform for carbon capture. Another famous project of Bloom Energy is a partnership with Shell (NYSE:SHEL) to build sustainable hydrogen energy solutions.\n\nThe objective of this partnership is to apply Bloom\u2019s solid oxide electrolyzer technology to generate clean hydrogen that can be utilized in the decarbonization of sectors which are hard to electrify.\n\nThis partnership is aimed at the development of modular technologies that will be used to replace the current hydrogen production from fossil fuels. This will help in minimizing the emission of greenhouse gasses.\n\nAlso, Bloom Energy has been in the process of incorporating its fuel cell technology with carbon capture systems.\n\nBE stock\u2019s presence in the industry is a striking contrast to XOM. It underlines how innovative startups can help the world move towards a greener future. This means that BE is one of those carbon capture stocks to consider along with the more established names in the industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Thanks to generative AI technologies and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a chip giant supplying much of the technology required to bring in the AI revolution, AI stocks are a hot commodity this year.\n\nAdditionally, the technology behind generative AI continues to improve. It now has models that can make high-quality movies and pictures. Applied AI research company, Runway, for example, is leading the way with new generative video models that Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) are considering for film usage.\n\nMoreover, a recent McKinsey survey found that creative AI is being employed in marketing, sales, and IT. Due to this acceptance, human resources costs are down, and supply chain and inventory management revenue is rising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGrowing from 36.6% to 36.8% yearly, the global AI industry is predicted to reach $1.345 trillion to $1.811 trillion by 2030. Certain forecasts see the market reaching $2.740 trillion by 2032, making AI stocks vital to future-proof any portfolio.\n\nNorth America dominates AI due to major AI stocks based in the region, robust research institutes, and attractive investment circumstances. The region earned 36.8% of global AI revenue in 2022. However, Asia-Pacific will also see significant growth in this area.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at three \u201cstrong buy\u201d AI stocks with double-digit upsides, all of which hold plenty of firepower to make a run for their 52-week highs.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares are down 29% in 2024 as investors worry about falling margins and retention rates, placing it precariously among AI stocks. However, Snowflake can mount a comeback, and the stock shows an average price target of $200.97, indicating a 50% upside potential from its current price of $133.72.\n\nProduct innovations and key alliances will drive Snowflake\u2019s growth. Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI engine now has vector search, massive language models, and other advancements. These solutions let companies automate analytics and properly leverage corporate data to develop AI-powered applications.\u200b\n\nAdditionally, Snowflake now works more closely with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Low-code/no-code application development, data governance tools, Snowflake\u2019s Data Cloud, and Microsoft\u2019s AI are the partners\u2019 goals.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric and Snowflake enable Apache Iceberg and bidirectional data under their partnership. Using this link, customers may work with a single copy of their data in many formats, simplifying data management and platform compatibility.\u200b\n\nStory continues\n\nSnowflake also announced a deeper NVIDIA partnership at Summit 2024. This agreement allows enterprises to swiftly construct custom AI solutions by integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI business software into Snowflake\u2019s Cortex AI platform.\n\nTo give advanced language models to its Data Cloud, Snowflake partnered with Mistral AI. This agreement allows Snowflake customers to leverage Mistral AI\u2019s robust language models, Mixtral 8x7B and Mistral Large, for AI applications.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up 11% this year, experts feel there is more space to expand; the average price target is $856.04, which is an 11.5% upside potential from the current price of $767.85.\n\nThe first-quarter 2024 financials from ServiceNow were robust. Having $1.82 EPS and $2.60 billion in sales, the company exceeded analysts\u2019 projections. ServiceNow was financially strong shown by its 13.59% return on equity and 20.34% net profit. The most recent financial results from ServiceNow show encouraging trends in the last three quarters, therefore validating its winning run.\n\nServiceNow unveiled its creative artificial intelligence technologies at Knowledge 2024 as well. These AI-powered improvements seek to automate and simplify several organizational processes in order to raise customer results.\n\nPlus, Clear Skye debuted Identity Governance and Administration 5.1 on ServiceNow. This version streamlines corporate operations and enhances identity security to provide consumers a safer, more consistent experience.\n\nExpanding their strategic alliance to provide consumers greater artificial intelligence freedom and options, ServiceNow and Microsoft are letting ServiceNow\u2019s platform interact with Microsoft\u2019s creative AI products, such as Azure OpenAI.\n\nAdditionally, Sonatype and ServiceNow are working to streamline software composition research. This will help companies manage open-source components and alliances, hence enhancing software security.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu\u2019s (NASDAQ:BIDU) first-quarter earnings did much to allay investor fears, which is why 13 out of 16 analysts covering the stock rate the Chinese tech giant a \u201cbuy.\u201d Consensus points to an average price target of $145.79, translating to a potential 56% upside.\n\nIn Q1 2024, core revenue rose 4% to $3.30 billion, while online marketing revenue was up 3% to $2.36 billion. Significant expansion of Baidu\u2019s AI Cloud company has driven a 6% year-over-year rise in non-online marketing income. Generative AI integration into the company\u2019s offerings is also showing promising outcomes.\n\nBaidu anticipates $4.79 billion in revenue and $2.69 EPS next quarter. The 2024 revenue forecast is $20.34 billion, up 8.76% from the previous year.\n\nThe business intends to keep investing in artificial intelligence and basic models, including the ERNIE Bot, which is supposed to generate fresh growth engines. Expanding its autonomous driving initiatives is another area of concentration for Baidu, which can help diversify its income sources and improve its market standing. Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go Robotaxi offering has grown very rapidly, thereby raising investor confidence.\n\nFurthermore, Baidu CEO Robin Li underlined the need to maintain a healthy relationship with Chinese authorities, which has allowed the business to negotiate legislative changes and keep its search and news feed products running smoothly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or\r\nindirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Buffett Believes Picking Stocks Can Be Risky: Consider Investing In These ETFs Instead\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett is known for making bold investment decisions, which have allowed him to become the world's eighth richest man, with a net worth of over $136 billion. But that isn't the reason behind Buffett's popularity among retail investors \u2013 it is his cost-effective investment strategies focused on a company\u2019s valuation rather than market noise.\n\nThe CEOs of Uber and Salesforce are so impressed with this platform they put their own money behind it. Join them, invest in private credit, and earn 7-9% APY.\n\nBuffett has repeatedly touted the risks involved in handpicking stocks, given the shifting market dynamics and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. Nonetheless, the Oracle of Omaha believes that investing in index funds can help mitigate the risks substantially.\n\n\"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" Buffett said during the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it. In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is own the S&P 500 index fund.\"\n\nAs one of the biggest supporters of value investing, Buffett also believes in maintaining a routine while investing in index funds, especially during volatile times. Buffett stated in 2019 that he instructed his trustee to invest 90% of his wealth into a low-cost S&P 500 index after passing away.\n\n\"Keep buying it through thick and thin, and especially through thin. ... American business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe will do very well,\" Buffett added.\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)\n\nUp by over 25% over the past year, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) is a low-cost ETF that tracks the S&P 500 Index, comprising 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. The ETF has an expense ratio of just 0.03%, making it ideal for passive investments.\n\nFurthermore, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF pays $7.19 in dividends annually, yielding nearly 1.3% on the current price. The ETF's top three largest holdings are Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) tracks the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With a low expense ratio of just 0.06%, the ETF primarily focuses on high-quality U.S. companies with a track record of consistently paying dividends.\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF pays $2.83 in dividends annually, yielding an impressive 3.54% on the current price. Its top holdings include The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).\n\nThis ETF offers potential for capital appreciation and a steady income stream through dividends, making it suitable for income-oriented investors.\n\nFidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund\n\nThe Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index is part of Fidelity\u2019s \u201cZERO\u201d line of index funds, which boast zero expense ratios.\n\nThe ETF primarily invests in the largest companies in the U.S. by market capitalization, providing investors with cost-effective exposure to some of the biggest and most established companies in the market. Interestingly, The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index has gained 25.13% over the past year, surpassing the benchmark S&P 500 index's 24.4% returns.\n\nIts top holdings include the Magnificent Seven stocks, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, and semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom Inc.

        "content": "Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) biggest-ever acquisition could face US pushback no matter who wins the White House this November.\n\nThe reported $23 billion bid to buy fast-growing cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz is the kind that is almost sure to attract scrutiny from Washington competition watchdogs, along with inevitable delays.\n\nA US regulatory review could stall a tie-up into next year, making it possible that a new administration could be tasked with evaluating its competitive risks.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Alphabet, which is already fighting antitrust challenges on other fronts, would be free of yet another legal fight.\n\n\"The current administration looks at vertical issues more heavily than has historically been the case,\" Colin Kass, a partner with Proskauer and co-chair of the firm\u2019s antitrust group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But even the prior administration, under Trump, did look at vertical issues even more so than earlier administrations.\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\n\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\n\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\n\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\n\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, attends a campaign rally in Ohio. (AP Photo/Jeff Dean) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\n\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\n\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\n\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\n\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what\u2019s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months. Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\n\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet\u2019s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\n\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\n\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Microsoft decides diversity \u2018no longer business critical\u2019, claims sacked manager",
        "content": "Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has decided diversity is \u201cno longer business critical\u201d, a former manager has claimed, after the company sacked two staff working on initiatives focused on inclusivity.\n\nThe tech giant laid off the employees working on its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, just four years after it pledged to double the number of black leaders within the company by 2025.\n\nAn email sent by one of the sacked workers, seen by Business Insider, said: \u201cTrue systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said that\u00a0the company\u2019s commitments in this area \u201cremain unchanged\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritising accountability, and continuing to focus on this work,\u201d he said.\n\nIt comes after a wave of companies increased their attention on diversity following the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer. The incident triggered a wave of protests by the Black Lives Matter movement, with the number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives almost trebling in the wake of the demonstrations.\n\nHowever, many companies have rowed back on or abandoned such initiatives in recent months as they battle soaring costs. Meta, Tesla and X (formerly known as Twitter) have all cut the size of their respective DEI teams by 50pc or more in 2023.\n\nZoom told staff earlier this year that it had dismantled its DEI team amid layoffs, which reflected a wider trend across the West.\n\nThe number of DEI jobs in the US shrunk 8pc during the first six weeks of 2024, data sourced by Revelio Labs and The Washington Post showed in February.\n\nDiversity consultants expect a similar trend to take place in the UK. Simon Fanshawe, who was one of six activists to set up LGBT charity Stonewall, said in May that he had witnessed a shift in attitude among employers over the role that diversity schemes should have in corporate Britain.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt seemed self-evidently right [in the past] but now they\u2019re saying, \u2018Actually, I\u2019m not convinced that a high street retailer should take a position on anti-conversion therapy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Because what\u2019s that got to do with the price of beans?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs well as cutting costs, companies are reconsidering their DEI plans amid fears that some diversity chiefs are silencing anyone with an opposing view and taking HR matters into their own hands.\n\nFran Itkoff, 90, from California, who had volunteered for a multiple sclerosis charity for more than 60 years, was forced to step down in January after she told a colleague she did not understand why she needed to add the pronouns \u201cshe/her\u201d to her email signature.\n\nThe National MS Society confirmed at the time that she \u201cwas asked to step away from her role because of statements that were viewed as not aligning with our policy of inclusion\u201d.\n\nThe subsequent backlash prompted the charity to apologise for what it said had been a \u201cmistake\u201d.",

        "title": "Analyst Thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Has More Upside Due to AI",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\n\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\n\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\n\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\n\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Does Analyst Says Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Has More Upside Potential?\n\ntanuha2001 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMSFT is one of the top names in King Lip\u2019s portfolio.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America\u2019s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows. Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares contributed to performance after the company reported strong fiscal second quarter results, underscoring its leadership position in the cloud and highlighted its role as a primary facilitator and beneficiary of Al adoption. Company revenue growth, operating margin, and earnings growth surpassed consensus expectations. The utility scale Azure cloud business grew 28% in constant currency of which 6% was Al related versus 3% last quarter. Further, management noted most of the Al revenue was from inference rather than training indicating high quality Al applications by Microsoft\u2019s clients. Management also indicated that significant cost-cutting programs in corporate America have begun to trail off. suggesting that the cost optimization headwinds previously impacting Azure\u2019s growth are abating. We continue to believe that Microsoft has the potential to hold a leading position in Al. given its innovative approach and demonstrated high unit volume growth opportunity.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy in July 2024 and Hold Until You\u2019re 70",
        "content": "The market offers plenty of options, but only a select few have the potential to be true long-term winners. Not many people can look at a company and say that they have good enough conviction that the business in question will remain relevant a few decades from now. Even half a decade can completely change everything\u2014as some can speak from personal experience.\n\nThus, it is important not to get \u201ctunnel visioned\u201d and keep your skin in the game. The means to an end matter. You should always be ready to sell if any of these companies become obsolete or face major stumbles in the coming decades. It pays to be flexible.\n\nWe\u2019ll be looking at seven stocks that I personally think will be relevant in 20 or 30-plus years. Their historical records and market dominance give me peace of mind for the long haul. However, it\u2019s equally important to focus on short-term growth. Remember, if you only wanted stability, you could park your money in bonds. We want our money to compound. Thus, each pick offers a blend of stability and growth and aims at nearer-term returns, too. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:INTU) makes tools for robotic-assisted surgery and is riding high on the megatrends of minimally invasive procedures and an aging population. Q1 procedure volumes surged 16% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nThis company simply has a massive runway for expansion. With its current clearances, the company estimates it can reach around seven million patients annually, over three times its current patient base. New product launches like the da Vinci 5 in the U.S. and Europe should further fuel adoption.\n\nFinancially, Intuitive Surgical is firing on all cylinders. Its Q1 revenue jumped 11% to $1.89 billion, while GAAP net income soared 53% to $545 million. Analysts are bullish, too.\n\nSure, challenges exist, such as competition in China. However, with the stock up 32% year-to-date (YTD) and demographics in its favor, Intuitive Surgical\u2019s best days are still ahead.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) has been a standout performer in the stock market lately.\u00a0The stock is up over 30% YTD. It has even been outshining Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Costco reported strong Q3 of fiscal year 2024 results, with revenue growing 9.1% to $57.39 billion and e-commerce sales jumping an impressive 20.7%. Net income surged nearly 30% to $1.68 billion. Same store sales growth has also started to pick up.\n\nStory continues stocks to buy: costco same store sales growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFurthermore, analysts are bullish on the stock. Oppenheimer raised its price target to $950, citing Costco\u2019s solid June sales driven by non-foods and its upcoming membership fee hike. Other firms like Baird, Loop Capital and Stifel also boosted their targets. The average 12-month analyst price target is now $910.05, implying an 8% upside.\n\nCostco has consistently been gaining market share. It benefits from loyal members and a compelling value proposition. Nevertheless, Costco does lag behind its rivals in key growth areas like e-commerce and advertising. Thus, future gains may need to come more from earnings growth than valuation expansion. I\u2019m still very bullish on the long run.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is a leading global industrial gases and engineering company that serves a wide range of industries. I believe Linde will remain one of the most consistent and stable stocks in the market going forward. The industrial gas sector has huge staying power, and Linde\u2019s revenues and profits should stay sticky even as the white-collar world rapidly changes.\n\nSeveral megatrends are providing tailwinds for Linde\u2019s business, including the clean energy transition, digitization and the rise of advanced electronics manufacturing. Linde is investing heavily to capture growth from these trends, such as its recent $150 million investment to supply industrial gases to the world\u2019s first large-scale green steel plant. Analysts are bullish on the stock, with an average price target of $489.31 (as of writing). That implies around an 11.7% upside.\n\nAlso, Linde delivered solid Q1 of 2024 results, with 6% operating profit growth. The stock has surged 115% in just the past five years. Thus, I\u2019m optimistic Linde will continue its steady trajectory as a core industrial holding. Companies tied to long-standing industries with enduring demand rarely underperform.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting services to government agencies and corporations. BAH stock has climbed an impressive 136% over the past five years, and I believe it has room to run higher.\n\nThe company is deeply embedded with many federal agencies that are expanding operations as the geopolitical environment grows more complex. BAH\u2019s expertise in areas like AI, cybersecurity and digital transformation aligns perfectly with the increasing technology needs of its government clients. I expect federal agencies will only become more reliant on the type of sophisticated solutions Booz Allen Hamilton delivers.\n\nThe firm posted Q1 earnings per share of $1.33 and revenue of $2.77 billion both topping expectations. While analyst opinions are mixed, the average price target of $168.78 points to further upside potential. I\u2019m optimistic Booz Allen can sustain its impressive growth trajectory as it capitalizes on powerful tailwinds in the government services market. This is a high-quality company that looks poised to thrive for decades to come.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) operates over 10,500 stores globally and generates over $600 billion in annual revenue. The company has been one of the best-performing retail stocks in 2024 so far, with shares jumping 29% in the first half of the year. Walmart crushed earnings expectations in Q1, with revenue growing 6% to $161.5 billion.\n\nThe company is rapidly automating its supply chain, which should massively increase profit margins in the coming years. In addition, Walmart is gaining grocery market share, growing e-commerce sales by 24%, and seeing huge tailwinds across the business. Per-store sales have naturally been booming, too. WMT sales per store\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI\u2019m confident this retail giant will continue to thrive for decades to come. While many retailers are struggling, Walmart looks poised to go from strength to strength. For patient investors, Walmart stock is a solid bet.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo on smartphone screen with blurred Amazon delivery or shipping boxes in the background. AMZN stock\n\nSource: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s leading e-commerce and cloud computing company. The company offers unparalleled exposure to two massive growth industries for decades to come. No other U.S. company can match Amazon\u2019s e-commerce dominance.\n\nBeyond retail, Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business gives it a stronghold in another critical sector. If artificial intelligence (AI) fulfills its immense promise, cloud providers like AWS stand to benefit enormously. Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the AI revolution. The company recently committed $230 million to expand its Generative AI Accelerator program for startups.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 28.5% this year (as of writing) as investors recognize its leadership in e-commerce and cloud. Moreover, today and tomorrow\u2019s Prime Days event could set new sales records, with JPMorgan analysts highlighting AI-powered shopping tools as a key driver.\n\nAmazon\u2019s financials are also robust, with $143 billion in Q1 revenue and 13% YOY growth. The company continues to innovate across its businesses while improving profitability. Amazon is uniquely positioned to ride multiple technological megatrends in the coming decades.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may be the single best bet on the software industry. This company has its hands on everything.\n\nWindows remains hugely popular globally. Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity apps spans industries. Moreover, Microsoft deserves immense credit for making the AI breakthrough a reality through its massive early investments in OpenAI.\n\nThose investments are now paying off handsomely. OpenAI is using Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud to power its AI systems. Additionally, Microsoft will receive a substantial share of OpenAI\u2019s future profits. And, the company maintains significant influence over OpenAI\u2019s direction.\n\nIn Q3 of 2024, revenue grew 17% YOY to $61.9 billion. Azure cloud revenue surged 31%. Cloud adoption is accelerating across industries. And of course, AI integration is driving increased demand for Microsoft\u2019s products and services.\n\nFew companies are as well-positioned to capitalize on the most important technology trends shaping our future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has launched an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of senior figures from start-up Inflection AI, having previously raised concerns about close partnerships between firms in the sector.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was looking into Microsoft\u2019s hiring of former Inflection staff, as well as \u201centry into associated arrangements\u201d by Microsoft with the AI firm as part of a merger inquiry.\n\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the creation of a new team, Microsoft AI, which will be led by British AI pioneer Mustafa Suleyman, who was the head of start-up Inflection AI, having previously founded DeepMind, the AI firm now owned by Google.\n\nA number of other Inflection staff have followed Mr Suleyman to Microsoft.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince then, the CMA has published a report raising concerns about the potential risks to open, fair and effective competition in the AI market.\n\nThe report specifically identified what it called an \u201cinterconnected web\u201d of more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments between a small handful of the biggest tech and AI firms, a set-up it warned could be used to consolidate power and resources within the sector.\n\nThe competition watchdog then asked for views from interested parties on the partnerships, including those between Microsoft and Mistral AI, Amazon and Anthropic, and Microsoft\u2019s links to Inflection.\n\nAmazon has invested around four billion dollars (\u00a33.2 billion) in Anthropic as it looks to gain an advantage in the AI race, while Microsoft announced a multi-year partnership with French AI start-up Mistral earlier this year, which is reported to include investment of around \u00a313 million.\n\nMicrosoft is also the biggest investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, while Apple has signed into partnership with OpenAI to embed ChatGPT into future versions of the iPhone as part of its Apple Intelligence scheme to bring more generative AI tools to its products.\n\nThe CMA now has until September 11 to complete its initial investigation and make on decision on whether a more in-depth investigation is needed.\n\nMicrosoft has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British regulators opened a preliminary investigation on Tuesday into Microsoft's hiring of an AI startup's key staff over concerns that it could thwart competition in the booming artificial intelligence market.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said its review of the hirings from Inflection AI, including its co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, turned up \u201csufficient information\u201d to open an investigation.\n\nMicrosoft hired Suleyman to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business earlier this year, and brought over several top engineers and researchers. Suleyman co-founded the AI research lab DeepMind, which is now owned by Google, before setting up Inflection and is considered an influential figure in the AI world.\n\nThe watchdog has indicated that it was assessing whether the hirings amount to a merger that results in \u201ca substantial lessening of competition\u201d in the U.K.'s AI market, in breach of the country's antitrust rules.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,\" Microsoft said in a statement. \"We will provide the UK Competition and Markets Authority with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.\u201d\n\nThe British watchdog has until Sept. 11 to decide whether to give its approval or escalate the probe into an in-depth investigation. The authority has the power to reverse deals or impose fixes to address competition concerns.\n\nAuthorities on both sides of the Atlantic have become concerned about how the biggest technology companies are gobbling up the talent and products of innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.\n\nThree members of the U.S. Senate wrote last week to antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, urging them to investigate Amazon's purchase of San Francisco-based Adept.

        "content": "By Krystal Hu, Greg Bensinger and Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has asked Amazon.com to provide more details on its deal to hire top executives and researchers from artificial intelligence startup Adept, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe request reflects the FTC's growing concern about how AI deals have been put together and follows a broader review of partnerships between Big Tech and prominent AI startups.\n\nThe informal inquiry into Amazon, which has not previously been reported, centers on last month's announcement that Adept Chief Executive David Luan and others were leaving to join Amazon, which would also license some of the startup's technology.\n\nSuch inquiries do not necessarily result in an official investigation or enforcement action.\n\nAmazon is trying to catch up with rivals Google and Microsoft, which partners with OpenAI, in developing its own large language models that can respond almost instantaneously to complicated prompts or queries.\n\nReuters previously reported on Amazon's efforts to establish a new organization called the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) team, focused on developing large language models. Luan is now running the \u201cAGI Autonomy\u201d team, consisting of many former Adept employees, and reporting to Rohit Prasad, head of the AGI team.\n\nFounded in 2022, Adept made a splash by raising over $400 million from venture capital investors with the aim to train large language models to perform general tasks for enterprise clients. Once valued at over $1 billion, it released some open-source models but failed to launch successful commercial products. It's unclear whether Amazon has compensated Adept investors, or the details of the licensing fees.\n\nAmazon, Adept and the FTC declined to comment.\n\nThe regulator is already investigating a similar move by Microsoft, which hired away much of another startup, Inflection AI's leadership and employees and agreed to pay a roughly $650 million licensing fee. The FTC is looking into whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, a source told Reuters last month.\n\nThis is not Amazon's first AI startup bet. Amazon has invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic since September, taking a minority stake in the San Francisco company.\n\nThe FTC earlier this year launched a study of investments and partnerships in the AI space, demanding information on Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, and Anthropic's tie ups with Google and Amazon.\n\nThe extensive document request, made in January, seeks details on how AI company partnerships with Big Tech influence strategy, pricing decisions, access to products and services, and personnel decisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcers also expressed concern about Big Tech companies wielding their existing advantages in AI to shut out smaller competitors. The FTC and Justice Department have staked out responsibility for potential probes into Microsoft, OpenAI and chipmaker Nvidia.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu and Greg Bensinger in San Francisco, Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.\u2019s investment into Inflection AI will get a full-blown UK antitrust probe, after the watchdog said it needed to take a closer look at the hiring of former employees from the artificial intelligence startup.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad Trump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Amazon Sold a Used Diaper.

It highlighted worries that the Silicon Valley companies were using this as a way to control and shape the nascent markets in the future.\n\nIt signaled that it would use its powers under merger control rules to decide whether some of these deals could fall under UK scrutiny, noting that some partnerships aren\u2019t structured like a traditional deal. It initially looked at Microsoft\u2019s investment into Mistral AI but found the tech firm hadn\u2019t acquired the ability to materially influence Mistral\u2019s commercial policy.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Inflection deal was what some have characterized as an \u201cacquihire\u201d \u2014 without the \u201cacquisition\u201d part. Microsoft agreed to pay Inflection $650 million, largely to license its AI software, alongside the move to hire much of the startup\u2019s staff, a person familiar with the arrangement said at the time.\n\nMicrosoft hired Mustafa Suleyman as well as Inflection\u2019s Chief Scientist and co-founder Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, along with most of the startup\u2019s employees earlier this year. Inflection, which had raised more than $1.5 billion and debuted a chatbot named PI, still struggled to find an effective business model, Suleyman had said after the launch.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the hiring of talent promotes competition and should not be treated as a merger,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cWe will provide the UK CMA with the information it needs to complete its inquiries expeditiously.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t the only big tech company that has been heavily recruiting the staff of AI startups. Amazon.com Inc. recently hired top executives and other employees from startup Adept AI Labs Inc., including its co-founder and former chief executive officer, according to an internal memo Amazon provided to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeparately, last week Microsoft dropped its plans to take board roles at OpenAI in a decision that was seen as a way to try and dodge growing regulatory scrutiny. Regulators in the US and Europe had expressed concerns about Microsoft\u2019s sway over OpenAI. The UK regulator is still to make a decision on whether to open a probe into the OpenAI investment.\n\n--With assistance from Amy Thomson.\n\n(Updates with more information and background throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs Here\u2019s How to Create a Social Safety Net With Bipartisan Support Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Millionaire-Making AI Stocks Set to Ride The Trend for the Long Run",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly impact the global economy and business in the coming years. While some debate sustainability of the current AI-driven growth, investors and traders alike consider AI stocks to buy. With AI technology undoubtedly here to stay, this disruption will reshape the way we work, conduct business and invest.\n\nMultiple stocks have seen dramatic gains in recent years due to AI adoption. However, they may be vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are getting the lion\u2019s share of headlines and investor interest as they battle it out for the leading edge. Yet, as with the dot-com boom, millionaire-making stocks haven\u2019t grown yet despite witnessing substantial returns.\n\nGenerative AI is expected to add $2.6-4.4 trillion globally in the coming years, allowing ample room for stock growth. As AI applications and technologies become more pervasive, the overall economic benefits are projected to be sizable.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile large companies make headlines, smaller players with consistent earnings and projected continued AI-enabled expansion may be worth examining. Let\u2019s explore three stocks to buy for long-term AI-driven returns.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer. data infrastructure stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the stocks to buy that has the potential to return millions is DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The technology firm provides data analytics and user authentication services for online companies. Its primary focus is helping advertisers reach audiences and achieve effective, quality returns on sales. The company uses AI to increase fraud detection capabilities. It also offers AI as a service to enhance the effectiveness of digital advertising and optimize strategies for individual businesses.\n\nWhat makes DoubleVerify attractive as a growth stock is that it has consistently increased EPS over the last four years. The company is projected to continue doing so this year, delivering a 17% sales growth in 2024. Expanding into new markets like Meta (NASDAQ:META), YouTube and TikTok will probably weigh on its current earnings but is expected to enhance future growth.\n\nThis may explain why analysts are so positive about DV stock. The average price target is currently at $29.12 per share. This represents a potential upside of over 45%, which typically spans for a 1-year period.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is an internet communications platform company. It is most known for its shared-screen meetings, which were prevalent during the pandemic. As the end of lockdowns brought a major decline in demand, Zoom now integrates AI into its software. ZM provides a one-stop business solutions platform for arranging communications as companies navigate hybrid work environments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is trading near pre-pandemic levels after its stock grew approximately ten-fold during the height of the pandemic. This means that ZM stock price is around 90% below its all-time record high. However, the company has since integrated AI and evolved into a tech company trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.3x for a tech. This is well below the S&P 500 average of 29.3.\n\nAnalysts expect continued growth, making Zoom one of the stocks to buy with an average price target signaling over 30% upside. Notably, Zoom has beaten consensus EPS consistently over the prior several earnings reports, with surprises ranging in double-digit territory.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is known for its AutoCAD software, which serves as the backbone of engineering and architectural development.\n\nThe company is positioning itself as the leader in 3D AI evolution through the use of generative AI to produce functional 3D shapes. In addition to AutoCAD, Autodesk offers other products like Fusion 360 and Maya that serve the construction, manufacturing and media industries.\n\nWhile it applies AI to many industries, the company has not seen significant investor interest as its share price is up less than 5% for the year. However, Autodesk is particularly compelling because of its very low expenses due to a subscription-based business model. This results in a gross profit margin of 92%, with the largest cost being sales and marketing to acquire new customers.\n\nAutodesk expects 10% revenue growth in 2024 through consistent growth that is not reliant on short-term AI trends. Also, analysts are optimistic about the ADSK stock, with 19 out of 23 recommending buying Autodesk shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 16, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH and Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. TTSH.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Lilly and UnitedHealth\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Eli Lilly and Co. and UnitedHealth Group Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, we now have Q2 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and only 44.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe one notable feature of this admittedly small and Finance-heavy sample of results is the very small proportion of the companies that are able to beat revenue estimates. The 44.8% revenue beats percentage compares to 69% for the same group of 29 S&P 500 members in the preceding quarter (2024 Q1) and is a low for the preceding 20 quarters.\n\nWe will be watching closely how the revenue beats percentage unfolds in the days ahead as we move into the heart of the Q2 earnings season.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have Q2 results from 20.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total Q2 earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Finance sector's EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking above the 20-quarter averages for this group of sector companies.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.4% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +25.9%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+62.7% vs. +24.2%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Its new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends.\r\n\r\nLilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares were in line with the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+5.6% vs. +5.5%). The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. UnitedHealth\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend.\r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Tile Shop have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +10.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $320.59 million has a strong financial health, with zero long-term debt and $24 million in cash as of first-quarter 2024. This positions the company to invest in growth and weather economic fluctuations.\r\n\r\nGross margins improved to 65.8% due to lower freight and product costs, reflecting effective cost management. Expansion of product lines, including new luxury vinyl tile (LVT) lines, enhances revenue diversification. E-commerce sales growth reflects a strategic shift to capture online markets. Effective cost management led to a 5.5% decline in SG&A expenses.\r\n\r\nYet, challenges include a 10.2% fall in comparable store sales, weak macroeconomic conditions, high SG&A expenses, inventory management issues and potential margin pressures. Dependence on professional customers, stiff competition and limited store footprint growth are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Snowflake Stock Meltdown: Is the Cloud Giant\u2019s Growth Story Over?",
        "content": "Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been in the cloud industry \u201cpenalty box\u201d since former CEO Frank Slootman retired suddenly at the end of February.\n\nSnowflake is a cloud data warehouse that competes with Cloud Giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as privately held competitors including Databricks, Motherduck and Clickhouse.\n\nIts fall has been precipitous. Snowflake stock sold at $230 per share before Slootman\u2019s announcement. It will open July 15 at about $136. It is still no bargain. The market cap is roughly 15 times expected sales of $3 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut is this something where you \u201cbuy on the dip?\u201d Or is this a broken growth story you need to walk away from?\n\nMassive Hack Attacks\n\nSnowflake is in the news right now for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt is responsible for a huge hack against AT&T (NYSE:T) and dozens of other companies that were storing data with it.\n\nSnowflake disclosed the hack on May 30. But it wasn\u2019t its technical systems that broke. According to the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) security subsidiary Mandiant, which investigated the problem, customers\u2019 contractors had their credentials stolen.\n\nBut blaming the victim doesn\u2019t work for me. First, as Mandiant noted, \u201cSome of the malware infections in Snowflake\u2019s systems date to 2020 and the credentials were, in some cases, still valid years after being stolen.\u201d Also, Snowflake only began demanding two-factor authentication from its users this month.\n\nIf I were a potential Snowflake customer, or even a current one, I\u2019d have to ask some hard questions, based on these facts. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like the answers.\n\nSlootman Out Before the Hammer Fell\n\nWhen Slootman stepped down in February, it was called an effort to \u201cstep up to AI.\u201d Slootman was called more of a business leader than a tech leader.\n\nBut that\u2019s not true. Slootman is a tech leader. He began his career running the data testing operation at Borland, a 1990s era tools company. After the dot-com bubble popped he joined a storage startup called Data Domain (now part of Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL)). Then he became CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). He is described as an \u201cinsanely confrontational\u201d leader.\n\nSnowflake was the third tech company he took public after Data Domain and ServiceNow. He was trusted by investors and thus able to run Snowflake from his home in Bozeman, Mont. A January profile on the Sequoia Capital site calls him a \u201cnext stage growth doctor.\u201d\n\nAs an investor, I like Frank Slootman. He supported his own myth by writing a book in 2022 called Amp it Up with blurbs by other tech leaders testifying to his greatness.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like \u201ca business leader\u201d who needs to give way to a \u201ctech leader.\u201d It sounds like a billionaire getting out of the way before the bad news hits. A hack that started in 2020, with credentials held by hackers for years, is not what customers and would-be customers want to read.\n\nThis is especially true as Goldman Sachs joins the parade of critics wondering whether generative AI is all its makers claim. Too much spending for too little benefit sounds like hard times and consolidation is on the way.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Snowflake Stock\n\nSnowflake made its reputation by offering tight integration with other tool vendors. This created a lot of partners, each with their own policies and many relied on third-party consultants to do their work. Yet Snowflake only began mandating two-factor authentication this month?\n\nThat\u2019s not the position you want to be in when the market is slowing, and your competitors include the Cloud Giants. My guess is Slootman still has a job to do and that is getting his investors out with their shirts on.\n\nThe near term outlook for this stock is grim. For investors\u2019 sake I hope it comes back.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in MSFT, AMZN, and NOW.

        "content": "While investing, identifying small-cap stocks with high growth potential can be a game-changer to maximize returns. Small-cap stocks often possess agility and growth prospects that larger companies may need help to match. Here, each is poised to deliver substantial returns on investment.\n\nThese companies represent diverse sectors \u2014 from technology solutions to digital advertising \u2014 but share a common thread: a strategic focus on robust revenue growth and innovative market strategies. Understanding these companies\u2019 unique market leads and financial strengths provides a larger perspective on their current opportunities and anticipates growth potential.\n\nSmall-cap stocks offer an edge to capitalize on emerging trends and disruptive technologies. For instance, the first company leverages its expertise in educational staffing services. Meanwhile, the second one expands its automation solutions with\u00a0solid\u00a0customer retention. Finally, the third company capitalizes on digital advertising shifts. These companies\u2019 fundamentals and market strategies can help in sharp investment decisions to amplify portfolio returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRCM Technologies (RCMT) A line of people holding resumes, as if at a staffing agency.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRCM Technologies (NASDAQ:RCMT) specializes in engineering consulting and staffing services. The company has a solid top-line growth trajectory, reflected by a 7.2% annual increase in revenue to $71.9 million for Q1 2024. This growth is bolstered by strong performances across its segments, particularly in engineering, where gross profit surged by an impressive 27.1%. Such substantial growth in the engineering segment indicates effective project execution and likely higher-margin contracts, contributing significantly to overall revenue expansion.\n\nRegarding profitability, RCM Technologies\u2019s adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.1% annually to\u00a0$6.8 million for Q1 2024, while adjusted diluted EPS saw a substantial increase of 30.4% to $0.53 per share. These metrics highlight the company\u2019s sharp cost controls that may lead to sustained growth momentum. Strategically, RCM Technologies has focused on expanding its market footprint, particularly in the K\u201312 education sector. The company reported 19.1% revenue growth in school districts served, reflecting successful onboarding of new clients and effective management of existing relationships.\n\nRCM Technologies\u2019 strong revenue growth in niche markets makes it a top mark on small-cap stocks with a high potential list.\n\nUiPath (PATH) Mobile phone with web page of software development company UiPath Inc. on display in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of cellphone screen. Unmodified photo. PATH stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) leads in robotic process automation (RPA) across industries. The company derived a 21% annual annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth to $1.508 billion for Q1 fiscal 2025. This growth is driven by a net new ARR of $44 million, excluding an FX headwind of $3 million. The consistent growth in ARR indicates strong customer retention and expansion. Moreover, UiPath ended the quarter with approximately 10,800 customers, highlighting its broad customer base. Significant growth in customers with higher ARR tiers, such as $1 million or more and $5 million or more, demonstrates scalability and deepens customer relationships.\n\nFurther, UiPath\u2019s revenue grew\u00a016% annually. Despite challenges in large multi-year deals, UiPath\u2019s revenue growth marks high market demand and operational scale. UiPath maintained a solid gross margin of 86%, with software gross margin at 90%, indicating efficient cost management and scalability in its cloud operations. Products like Autopilot have garnered significant customer interest, with over 1,500 organizations using them.\u00a0This\u00a0indicates strong market acceptance and the potential for rapid adoption, accelerating customer time-to-value.\n\nTo sum up, UiPath stands out among small-cap stocks with a high potential list due to its rapid growth in ARR and progressive button line.\n\nPerion Network (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion Network (NASDAQ:PERI) specializes in digital advertising and programmatic platforms. The company\u2019s trends fluctuate due to external factors, such as changes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing\u2019s pricing strategies. Despite challenges, Perion\u2019s consolidated top line grew 9% annually to $157.8 million in Q1 2024. This growth is primarily attributed to the sharp performance of newer growth engines. Similarly, retail Media Solutions grew 134% annually to $14.9 million, constituting 20% of the advertising solutions revenue.\n\nAdditionally, connected TV (CTV) advertising revenue surged 108% annually to $8.2 million.\u00a0This\u00a0highlights strong customer adoption of high-impact CTV solutions. Digital out-of-home advertising revenue increased by 25% annually to $9.7 million, driven by the strategic acquisition of HiveStack.\u00a0Indeed, these growth engines collectively mitigate the impact of declines in other areas, like video advertising, reflecting Perion\u2019s ability to capitalize on emerging digital advertising trends. At its core, SORT 2.0, an upgraded AI-based audience segmentation technology, extends its capabilities beyond the web to CTV.\n\nPerion\u2019s successful diversification beyond traditional search advertising derives substantial revenue growth and market share expansion, making it a solid choice among top small-cap stocks with high potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Google deal for 'hot market' cyber firm Wiz would bolster cloud security",
        "content": "By Zeba Siddiqui\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - If Alphabet's Google is successful in its effort to buy cloud security company Wiz, it would bolster its cloud security offerings for large organisations, a hotspot for hackers, and help it take on cloud rivals Amazon.com and Microsoft, experts said.\n\nAlphabet is in advanced talks to acquire Wiz, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday, in an up to $23 billion deal that would be Google's most expensive acquisition and provide it with cybersecurity products that defend against ransomware gangs wreaking havoc on large enterprises.\n\n\"There is a hot market for cloud security,\" said Jerome Seguera, a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity firm MalwareBytes, adding that Wiz gives customers \"great visibility into their assets in a straightforward way.\"\n\nWiz offers tools that allow organisations to scan their entire infrastructure and specific software for threats.\n\nGoogle has been steadily expanding its cybersecurity offerings in recent years. Two years ago it bought the popular cyber firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion.\n\n\"I think they are trying to compete with Microsoft and to a smaller extent AWS (Amazon Web Services),\" said Marc Bleicher, chief technology officer of the security firm Surefire Cyber.\n\n\"Wiz is one of only a few who address a big chunk of the cloud security market in one platform,\" Bleicher said.\n\nWiz was founded in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, primed to benefit from the move towards remote work and the shift by organisations to cloud environments from desktops. Most large organisations have also shifted to storing their data on the cloud over the years, but that has come with security risks - especially as companies expand and become more complex.\n\nIts founders, former Israeli army intelligence members, earlier founded another cloud security firm named Adallom that Microsoft bought for $320 million in 2015.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, the company has grown rapidly since then. Only two months ago, at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francsico, Wiz said it was valued at $12 billion. It now expects annual organic revenue of $1 billion in 2025 and has raised nearly $2 billion in venture capital investment in total, said a person familiar with the Google deal talks, declining to be named.\n\nThe Wiz buyout talks come as the pace of global dealmaking in cybersecurity has significantly picked up in 2024. There were 120 global cybersecurity deals announced in the first half of this year, accounting for $12.4 billion in deal value, compared to 137 such deals last year, or $4.8 billion in deal value, according to data from the financial information firm Dealogic.\n\nStory continues\n\nDave Dewalt, founder of the cyber-focused venture capital firm NightDragon, said Wiz's growth is the result of strong marketing and being \"at the right place, at the right time, with the right product.\"\n\nDeWalt, former chief executive of cybersecurity firm FireEye, said cloud security is the most important and fastest-growing part of cybersecurity, driven by increasing attacks on large organisations.\n\n\"The stakes are exponentially higher in the cloud. So therefore, the security needs to be exponentially stronger, and (there's) more revenue from it,\" he said, adding that Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike had also beefed up their cloud security offerings in recent years.\n\n(Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in San Francisco, James Pearson in London, Milana Vinn in NEW YORK, and Krystal Hu in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders and Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in July",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term that describes seven of the world's largest tech companies, many of which have been among the best-performing stocks over the past few years. The companies are Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nEach Magnificent Seven company is an industry leader in its own right and at the forefront of many innovations. However, the following three companies stand as particularly good buys in July and going forward. If you're looking for tech stocks with appealing growth opportunities to add to your portfolio, they're well worth considering.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nNvidia's stock surge over the past two years has gotten a lot of attention (rightfully so), but Microsoft has also experienced significant growth. It's the second-best performing Magnificent Seven stock over the past three years and up over 22% in 2024 (as of July 12).\n\nA lot has been said about the rising valuations of big tech companies, and many of them are warranted. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 39, Microsoft is expensive by virtually all standards, leaving it susceptible to a market correction. MSFT PE Ratio Chart\n\nThankfully, the one thing Microsoft has going for it that other Magnificent Seven stocks don't is the vast ecosystem it has developed through the years. And it's not just the ecosystem, it's the customers that Microsoft serves in this ecosystem: other businesses.\n\nCountless businesses globally count on Microsoft's products and services to run their businesses. Between PCs, Office software, cloud service Azure, and recruiting hub LinkedIn, Microsoft has its hand in multiple crucial enterprise-focused industries.\n\nThis helps shield it a bit against downturns because it's not as easy for businesses to abandon Microsoft's services or products as it is for consumers of other tech companies. By no means does it make Microsoft a foolproof investment, but you can almost be certain of its long-term stability and growth trajectory. If its valuation worries you, I'd recommend dollar-cost averaging your way into a stake.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nDespite surging over 34% this year, Alphabet still seems like a bargain compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to market dominance, there may not be a more clear example than Google's search business. Google search has around a 90% market share globally, and it's maintained this dominance for quite some time. And although you never want to make assumptions, it's safe to assume it'll continue this dominance for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts leadership position in search has led to a bustling advertising business. In the first quarter (Q1) of 2024, Google advertising generated $61.7 billion in revenue, with Google search specifically bringing in $46.2 billion. Google advertising accounted for over 78% of Alphabet's revenue in Q1 and was up 13% year over year. GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAdvertising will continue to keep Alphabet's lights on, but the growth of its cloud platform, Google Cloud, shouldn't be overlooked. Google Cloud has turned the corner on profitability, and in Q1, its operating income (profit from its core operations) grew 371% to $900 million.\n\nWith a dominant search business, a fast-growing cloud business, and a newly announced dividend ($0.20 quarterly), Alphabet is in a great position for sustained long-term growth.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon became the company it is today because of its e-commerce business, but it has done a great job at branching out and ensuring its business isn't too dependent on just that segment.\n\nHaving the foresight to see the role cloud services would eventually play has worked wonders for Amazon and its bottom line. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global leader in cloud computing, with a lead it should manage to hold on to for a while, barring a major competitive disruption.\n\nIn Q1, AWS generated just over 17% of Amazon's revenue but over 61% of its operating income. Cloud computing is a much higher-margin business than e-commerce, so its growth will continue to boost Amazon's profitability. Add in the emerging AI innovations, and AWS is becoming a one-stop shop for cloud and AI solutions.\n\nAmazon has spent billions building out its e-commerce and cloud infrastructure, and it's now at the point where it can leverage these investments to generate new revenue streams. Take Supply Chain by Amazon, for example, an end-to-end set of supply chain services that allows sellers to take advantage of Amazon's logistics network.\n\nAmazon is a company built for sustained growth, and investors can feel confident holding on to it for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

The move came as Apple was seen as lagging behind Alphabet's (GOOG) Google and Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI in the AI race.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey added that Apple could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. The investment bank previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years and raised its price target to $273 from $216 based on the new projections.\n\nRead more: LIVE: FTSE 100 and European markets fall after Powell teases 'confidence' in inflation data\n\nThe stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to London Stock Exchange data.\n\nApple stock has risen more than 26% year to date and over 8% in the last month.\n\nOcado (OCDO.L)\n\nOcado said losses narrowed significantly in the latest six-month period, as it lifted its forecasts on signs that demand for online deliveries was picking up again.\n\nThe group reported a \u00a3154m ($199.7m) pre-tax loss for the six months to 2 June against losses of \u00a3290m a year ago.\n\nIt notched up revenues of \u00a31.54bn for the first half, boosted by a 21.8% surge in its technology solutions business, which powers online grocery businesses and automated warehouses for other retailers.\n\nOcado retail \u2014 run as a joint venture with Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) \u2014 saw revenues rise 11.3%, helping the division swing to underlying earnings of \u00a320.7m from a \u00a32.5m loss a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nOcado has shifted its focus in the last few years to providing B2B robotics and automation services, with some suggesting it could spin out the retail business to focus solely on tech.\n\n\u201cWe have come through an unprecedented period for online grocery, with multiple years of high food inflation following a surge in demand during the pandemic. The global channel shift to online has now resumed and Ocado is uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity,\u201d Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado Group, said.\n\nOcado said it was raising its profit and cash flow guidance for the full year.\n\nRichemont (CFR.SW)\n\nCartier owner Richemont reported a small drop in sales for its fiscal first quarter amid slowing demand for luxury goods, with a slump in Chinese demand pushing the overall result slightly below expectations.\n\nRichemont, which also owns brands including Van Cleef & Arpel, said sales were down 27% in the Greater China region in the three months to the end of June.\n\nThe slump was partially offset by stronger jewellery sales in other countries, with overall sales up 1% at constant exchange rates.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch this week: Anglo American, Burberry, TSMC and Netflix\n\n\u201cThe decline reflected both the low level of consumer confidence and the strong comparatives ranging from double-digit growth in the mainland to triple digits in Hong Kong and Macau over the prior-year period,\u201d Richemont said.\n\nFor the period ending 30 June, the luxury-goods group booked sales of \u20ac5.27bn (\u00a34.42bn, $5.74bn), compared with \u20ac5.32bn in the prior-year period. The result came broadly in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts of \u20ac5.28bn, according to a poll of estimates compiled by Visible Alpha.\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMining firm Rio Tinto\u2019s London-listed shares fell after it reported second-quarter iron ore shipments below analyst estimates.\n\nIron ore production from the group\u2019s Pilbara assets in Western Australia came in at 79.5 million tonnes, 2% lower than the same period.\n\nRio said productivity gains offset ore depletion but that production and shipping in the quarter were impacted by a train collision in mid-May, which resulted in around six days of lost rail capacity and full stockpiles at some mines.\n\nThe firm's report comes as hopes for more stimulus in China have helped iron ore prices rebound recently after weak demand from the country's construction sector led to a dull first half.\n\n\"The (Chinese) government has provided additional measures for the property market to destock the large inventory overhang,\" Rio said on Tuesday.\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Rises Yet Lags Behind Market: Some Facts Worth Knowing",
        "content": "In the latest market close, Microsoft (MSFT) reached $453.96, with a +0.09% movement compared to the previous day. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.28%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.53%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.4%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 2.48% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Microsoft will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.90, reflecting a 7.81% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $64.16 billion, reflecting a 14.19% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Right now, Microsoft possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Microsoft has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.41 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.81.\n\nAlso, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.14. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Software industry stood at 2.49 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 102, finds itself in the top 41% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Monday, July 15, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), as well as a micro-cap stock Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (TTSH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nQ2 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, we now have Q2 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and only 44.8% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe one notable feature of this admittedly small and Finance-heavy sample of results is the very small proportion of the companies that are able to beat revenue estimates. The 44.8% revenue beats percentage compares to 69% for the same group of 29 S&P 500 members in the preceding quarter (2024 Q1) and is a low for the preceding 20 quarters.\n\nWe will be watching closely how the revenue beats percentage unfolds in the days ahead as we move into the heart of the Q2 earnings season.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have Q2 results from 20.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total Q2 earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe Finance sector's EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking above the 20-quarter averages for this group of sector companies.\n\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.4% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.\n\nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\n\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +25.9%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. \r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth. \r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+62.7% vs. +24.2%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Its new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends. \r\n\r\nLilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s. \r\n\r\nHowever, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares were in line with the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+5.6% vs. +5.5%). The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. UnitedHealth\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. \r\n\r\nThe Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend. \r\n\r\nHowever, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Tile Shop have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +10.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $320.59 million has a strong financial health, with zero long-term debt and $24 million in cash as of first-quarter 2024. This positions the company to invest in growth and weather economic fluctuations. \r\n\r\nGross margins improved to 65.8% due to lower freight and product costs, reflecting effective cost management. Expansion of product lines, including new luxury vinyl tile (LVT) lines, enhances revenue diversification. E-commerce sales growth reflects a strategic shift to capture online markets. Effective cost management led to a 5.5% decline in SG&A expenses. \r\n\r\nYet, challenges include a 10.2% fall in comparable store sales, weak macroeconomic conditions, high SG&A expenses, inventory management issues and potential margin pressures. Dependence on professional customers, stiff competition and limited store footprint growth are other concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Infosys Limited (INFY) and McKesson Corporation (MCK).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "content": "Microsoft's MSFT recent $1.5 billion investment in G42, a UAE-based artificial intelligence (AI) firm, has drawn the attention of Republican lawmakers, who are calling for a thorough intelligence assessment of the deal.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul and John Moolenaar, leaders of key House committees, have requested a briefing from the Biden administration, citing concerns over the potential transfer of sensitive technology and G42's historical ties to China.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers are particularly worried about the deal's second phase, which could involve the transfer of export-restricted semiconductor chips and sophisticated AI model weights, crucial components that enhance an AI model's capacity to mimic human reasoning.\r\n\r\nThis request underscores growing apprehensions about the lack of regulations governing the export of advanced AI technologies, with fears that companies like G42 might share this prized technology with U.S. adversaries, particularly China.\r\n\r\nIn their letter to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, the Republican representatives expressed deep concern about the rapid advancement of a partnership involving \"the unprecedented transfer of highly sensitive, U.S.-origin technology, without congressional consultation or clearly defined regulations in place.\" They specifically requested an assessment of G42's ties to China's Communist Party, military and government before the Microsoft deal progresses further.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers' concerns were further fueled by a recent visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Beijing, reportedly to discuss AI cooperation. This diplomatic engagement has heightened anxieties about potential technology transfers to China, a country with which the U.S. has increasingly strained relations in the tech sector.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has responded to these concerns, stating that it is working closely with the U.S. government and that \"U.S. national security will continue to be a principal priority.\" The White House National Security Council has also indicated its commitment to ongoing dialogue with lawmakers regarding the risks associated with digital infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAdding another layer of complexity to the situation, G42's past involvement in \"digital surveillance\" work and alleged connections to Emirati cybersecurity firm DarkMatter have been cited as areas of possible risk. These concerns highlight the intricate web of international relationships and potential security implications surrounding the deal.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, G42 announced in February that it had divested its investments in China and accepted constraints imposed by the United States to work with U.S. companies. This move, along with reports that the Microsoft-G42 deal was largely orchestrated by the Biden administration to limit China's influence, presents a complex picture of competing interests and strategic maneuvers in the global AI landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft Navigates Cloud Antitrust Concerns Amid Regulatory Challenges\n\nAs this situation unfolds, it underscores the delicate balance that must be struck between fostering technological innovation, maintaining international partnerships and safeguarding national security interests. The outcome of this congressional inquiry and any subsequent actions could have far-reaching implications for future international AI collaborations and the regulatory framework surrounding AI technology exports.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft continues to face regulatory scrutiny on multiple fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. In response, Microsoft has relinquished its board observer seat at OpenAI to alleviate antitrust concerns in the United States and United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nRecent legal challenges include a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over alleged discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. Additionally, the EU has accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its business software.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has successfully resolved a potential European Union antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices by reaching an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon-backed trade association. This settlement comes after Microsoft made several concessions to address concerns raised by cloud service providers, effectively ending a prolonged dispute. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nShares of MSFT have gained 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s growth of 31%.\r\n\r\nWhile the CISPE agreement marks progress, it has drawn criticism from major players like Amazon AMZN-based Amazon Web Services, Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba BABA cloud service, who were not included in the settlement. These companies argue that the agreement fails to address the needs of most Microsoft customers who still face restrictions in choosing their preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nAs the tech industry evolves, Microsoft's ability to navigate these regulatory challenges will be crucial in shaping its future and the competitive landscape of the global tech market.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Hot Stocks: 3 Micro-Sized Mavericks With Mega-Sized Potential",
        "content": "The tech run that we have been experiencing came under some pressure on Thursday with FAANG stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others pulling back as traders rotated out of large caps and into small-cap stocks, as reported by Investopedia. The article went on to say that this rotation was mainly because of the expectations that the Federal Reserve will move to reduce the interest rates this year and this would definitely be beneficial for micro-cap stocks, as it may improve their risk profiles.\n\nOver the past couple of years, thanks to a boom in AI spending and investment, micro-cap stocks have left somewhat out of the picture, with indices like the Russell 2000 index gaining only 38.79% over the past five years to the Nasdaq\u2019s 125.85%. Broadly, I believe that these micro-cap stocks could be seen as undervalued on a systematic basis, which gives them huge potential for investors.\n\nSo here are three micro-cap stocks for investors to consider buying amid these market developments and projections.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlackSky Technology (BKSY) A photo of a satellite over earth.\n\nSource: AlexLMX / Shutterstock\n\nBlackSky Technology (NYSE:BKSY) is an interesting but quite a risky investment. Still, there is no gain without a proportionate amount of risk to take on, and BKSY is one of those hot, micro-cap stocks that could become a multibagger.\n\nThe thesis for BKSY hinges on the planned launch of next generation Gen-3 satellites, which could be a game changer given that the enhanced imaging could lead to new applications and acquisition of new clients.\n\nHowever, BKSY does have some weaknesses. Its\u00a0crucial problem is profitability \u2014 or the lack thereof. Although there is an increase in adjusted EBITDA, BlackSky remains to have significant GAAP losses and negative free cash flow because of the high operating costs and capital investments.\n\nStill, the satellite technology has a unique competitive advantage in that it allows customers to \u201ccapture and quickly deliver large volumes of dawn-to-dusk, time-diverse imagery [that] increases transparency into strategic defense and economic activities which could otherwise have gone unnoticed.\u201d\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock. micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nAs an investor, I must say that I am quite bullish on Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). I do agree that the company has gone through some difficulties in the past but I think that the recent events have greatly improved the company\u2019s position.\n\nThe major development is that Plug Power has at last got a conditional $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy in May. This is a great endorsement to the company\u2019s technology and the future business expansion plans. Of course there are some steps that they have to overcome in order to get the actual money, but the fact that the Department of Energy is ready to invest such a large amount is already a big plus.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen analyzing the recent financials, there is still much to do and improve in terms of profitability. However, the company is clearly progressing \u2014 service and fueling margins are growing and the company has managed to control cash outlay quite effectively. With the new capital they can raise, I think they have a decent chance of reaching self-sustaining free cash flow in the next three to five years, which would be supported by a capital raise. This then makes it one of those micro-cap stocks with great potential.\n\nTurtle Beach (HEAR) micro-cap stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am quite enthusiastic about the current happenings at Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR). This renowned gaming accessories firm has recently acquired something that I feel will allow it to expand and become profitable in the future.\n\nIn my opinion the $118 million deal to acquirePerformance Designed Products is a big deal. Performance Designed Products is a key rival particularly in the controller category, thus adding them to the company\u2019s product line and market presence enhances the company\u2019s standing.\n\nHowever, the complementarities expected from this deal are quite handsome as well. The company expects to achieve cost synergies of $11 million and there could be revenue synergies as well given their combined scale and distribution reach. This should help in increasing the profitability of the company greatly.\n\nAmid the announcement, HEAR has also courted the attention of some Wall Street analysts, despite having a market cap of just $300 million. Within the next twelve months, HEAR is expected to post positive accounting profits, as it has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14x. These factors combined then makes it one of those micro-cap stocks with immense potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor held a LONG position in NVDA.\n\nMatthew started writing coverage of the financial markets during the crypto boom of 2017 and was also a team member of several fintech startups. He then started writing about Australian and U.S. equities for various publications. His work has appeared in MarketBeat, FXStreet, Cryptoslate, Seeking Alpha, and the New Scientist magazine, among others.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 3 Years From Now",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's most valuable company again with a market cap of $3.57 billion. Its stock rallied more than 60% over the past three years, even as iPhone sales cooled off amid tougher macro and competitive headwinds.\n\nFrom fiscal 2023 (ended last September) to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Apple's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its earnings per share (EPS) rises at a CAGR of 10%. That growth will likely be driven by a cyclical recovery in iPhone sales, an expansion into higher-growth markets like India, and the evolution of Apple's subscription ecosystem that hosts over a billion subscribers. Apple will also likely repurchase tens of billions of dollars in shares every year to boost its EPS. Image source: Apple.\n\nThose growth rates make Apple a stable long-term investment, but they're a bit weak for a stock that trades at 35 times forward earnings and 9 times this year's sales. Therefore, Apple's valuations might have been inflated by the recent hype regarding its generative AI plans for its first-party apps. Assuming Apple meets Wall Street's estimates and still trades at the same price-to-sales ratio by fiscal 2026, its market cap could grow about 12% to $4.01 billion by the final year.\n\nThat market cap would still make Apple one of the world's most valuable companies, but I believe three of its trillion-dollar peers -- Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- could eclipse its valuation over the next three years.\n\nThe key differences between these tech titans\n\nApple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet operate different business models. Apple generates more than half of its revenue from the iPhone, but it relies on its services business to drive most of its growth. Nvidia generates most of its revenue by selling high-end data centers for processing AI tasks.\n\nMicrosoft generates over half of its revenue from its cloud businesses, which include its Azure cloud infrastructure platform, Office 365 productivity services, and Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) services. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, its advertising network, and YouTube. However, its smaller Google Cloud business is growing at a much faster clip than its core advertising business.\n\nAll four companies have been expanding their generative AI ecosystems. Apple recently integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its own apps and announced new generative AI features for creating images and writing text. Microsoft, which is OpenAI's top investor, integrates the start-up's generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has been upgrading its Gemini generative AI platform to keep up with OpenAI, and it's been rolling out those tools across its entire ecosystem. Nvidia profits from that secular trend by selling the best \"picks and shovels\" for the AI gold rush.\n\nAll three tech giants are growing faster than Apple\n\nBut out of these four companies, only Apple generates most of its sales from a slower-growth and cyclical consumer electronics business. Nvidia is a high-growth chipmaker, Microsoft is a cloud and AI play, and Alphabet is a digital advertising company. That's why analysts expect all three companies to grow faster than Apple over the next three years.\n\nCompany Estimated Revenue CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Estimated EPS CAGR (Next 3 Fiscal Years) Current Market Capitalization Price-to-Sales Ratio (Forward) Apple 5% 10% $3.57 billion 9 Nvidia 46% 53% $3.26 billion 28 Microsoft 15% 17% $3.47 billion 14 Alphabet 11% 20% $2.37 billion 7\n\nData source: MarketScreener.\n\nAssuming they match those estimates and their price-to-sales ratios hold steady, Nvidia could be worth $5.3 trillion by fiscal 2027 (which ends in January 2027), Microsoft would be worth $4.5 trillion by fiscal 2026 (which ends in June 2026), and Alphabet's market cap could reach $3 trillion. But with the same price-to-sales ratio as Microsoft, Alphabet's market cap could nearly reach $6 trillion. Therefore, all three tech giants have a shot at eclipsing Apple's market cap over the next three years.\n\nBut look beyond the market caps\n\nIt's interesting to track the market caps of the world's largest companies, but it's a superficial approach that glosses over their core strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAll four of these \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks will likely keep growing. Apple is a rock-solid investment in the mobile computing market, Microsoft and Google are evolving into cloud and AI companies, and Nvidia is still arguably the best pure play on the AI accelerator chip market. So instead of wondering which tech giant will be the most valuable in three years, investors should simply focus on their ability to expand their ecosystems, widen their moats, and generate consistent growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. is in talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign Trump Emerges Defiant From Rally Attack Set to Shake Up \u201924 Race BlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad I Was at the Trump Rally Where He Was Shot. Here Is What I Saw Trump\u2019s Bloodied, Defiant Image After Shooting Pumps Up His Base\n\nThe transaction could total as much as $23 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. That would make it the tech giant\u2019s largest acquisition to date.\n\nAn agreement hasn\u2019t been reached and talks could still end without one, the person said.\n\nA representative for Alphabet didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Wiz declined to comment. The talks were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe talks come on the heels of Alphabet shelving efforts to acquire customer relationship management company HubSpot Inc., which Bloomberg News reported last week. As was the case with the HubSpot deal, a potential acquisition as large as that of Wiz is unusual for a big tech company like Alphabet, given the heightened scrutiny that the company faces by antitrust regulators.\n\nGoogle already faces several antitrust challenges, including a lawsuit by the US Justice Department accusing it of abusing its dominant position in online search and another one regarding its digital advertising tools.\n\nAlphabet has been ramping up its investment in its cloud customer business, including offering more generative artificial intelligence tools for clients. Though Google still lags behind Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the market for cloud computing, the company reported that its cloud unit has been profitable in consecutive quarters, after years of the unit being a money-losing operation.\n\nAn acquisition of Wiz, a cloud and cybersecurity company, could help Google catch up to Microsoft and Amazon in an increasingly competitive cloud market.\n\nAs more startups are moving their apps and data to the cloud, the opportunity in the sector is growing, particularly as generative AI apps and tools continue to gain traction. Such tools often require enormous data sets to be uploaded to the cloud that AI models can train on, in order for them to be able to generate output like images, marketing campaigns or software code, based on what users prompt the generative AI software with.\n\nNew York-based Wiz connects to cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure and identifies and scans data stored in the cloud, looking for and removing security risks. The company, founded in 2020, was valued at $12 billion during a May funding round that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Alphabet deal for Wiz would follow its $5.4 billion purchase of cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc. in 2022. That was the company\u2019s second-largest acquisition, topped only by its deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC completed in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n--With assistance from Liana Baker and Ryan Gould.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla Asia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs French Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cloud computing makes it easier for companies and consumers to store data and become more efficient. Also, it more affordable to use cloud providers than it is to invest in the hardware which needs management. These benefits have resulted in a multi-year boom that isn\u2019t slowing down.\n\nThe cloud computing industry has a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.8% through 2031. Artificial intelligence (AI) should keep growth rates elevated since AI tools rely on cloud platforms to process large amounts of data.\n\nMany tech giants have positioned themselves to benefit from the booming cloud industry. In addition, these same corporations have trounced the S&P 500 over the past five years and look ready to extend their rallies. High revenue and net income growth are key components for each of these cloud stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWondering which sky-high cloud stocks can take your portfolio higher? These are some of the top picks that can reward patient investors in the long run.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) service now sign logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is up by 8% year-to-date (YTD) and has delivered a 146% gain over the past five years. The cloud platform features rising revenue and net profit margins. Luckily for long-term investors, it\u2019s also feeling the heat from a bearish analyst.\n\nA Guggenheim analyst warned that generative AI revenue may not grow as quickly as anticipated. It\u2019s possible, according to the bearish call, that this catalyst won\u2019t come to fruition until 2025. ServiceNow is still rated as a strong buy with a projected 15% upside, so most analysts are still bullish.\n\nThe bearish call has resulted in a sharp drop that presents a buy-the-dip opportunity. A look at recent earnings highlights the long-term potential. ServiceNow reported 24% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in the first quarter and raised its full-year guidance. Net income more than doubled YOY to reach $347 million. NOW has a 98% renewal rate among 8,100 customers. And some of them pay more than $1 million per year to use the company\u2019s cloud platform. Therefore, ServiceNow looks ready to deliver long-term gains for patient investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the largest market share in the cloud computing industry. The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) makes up roughly one-third of the total market, and it\u2019s growth is accelerating. The tech giant reported 13% YOY net sales growth across its business. AWS stood out with 17% YOY growth, bringing in $25.0 billion in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Amazon isn\u2019t just winning in the cloud computing industry. Also, it is leading the way in e-commerce, advertising, groceries, streaming and other verticals. Each of these segments allows Amazon to show up in front of more consumers. It\u2019s certainly been showing up for investors.\n\nCurrently, Amazon stock is up by 33% YTD and have roughly doubled over the past five years. Wall Street analysts believe that the stock has more room to run. The average price target suggests an 11% upside for the consensus strong buy stock. The highest price target of $246 per share indicates that the stock can gain 23% from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Minesweeper game with bombs and exploded frowny face, classic Microsoft computer game\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/tomeqs\n\nThe second-largest cloud provider, Microsoft\u2018s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud services are growing at a faster rate than Amazon\u2019s. Microsoft Cloud generated $35.1 billion in Q3 of fiscal year 2024 which was 23% higher than the same period last year. AI is fueling more demand for the company\u2019s cloud platform.\n\nThe tech conglomerate as a whole reported 17% YOY revenue growth and 20% YOY net income growth. And, MSFT rewarded shareholders with some of its profits. The company poured $8.4 billion into share repurchases and dividends in the quarter.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades at a 40 P/E ratio and has a 0.65% yield. Shares are up by 24% YTD and have gained 232% over the past five years. It\u2019s a core component of the S&P 500 and most funds in general. Wall Street analysts believe there\u2019s more upside to the stock and have rated it as a strong buy. The average price target suggests a 9% gain from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NOW, AMZN, and MSFT.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for about $23 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. If the deal is finalized, it will be the company\u2019s largest ever acquisition.\n\nThe news comes days after reports surfaced that Alphabet has decided not to pursue an acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE: NYSE:HUBS), a company with a market cap of over $24 billion. Antitrust scrutiny was said to have played a part in the company\u2019s decision not to acquire HubSpot.\n\nWiz posted annual recurring revenue of $350 million in 2023, up from $100 million in its first 18 months after its founding in 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport.\n\nThe company raised $1 billion earlier this year at a valuation of $12 billion, suggesting the takeover is nearly double from those levels. Wiz is backed by venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.\n\nWiz was one of the rare startups outside of AI to raise capital at a higher valuation in 2024. Many startups are suffering from a tech boom hangover fueled by the low-interest rate environment.\n\nIf a deal is completed, it would be nearly double the value of Google\u2019s largest deal to date, a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Meanwhile, its second-largest acquisition to date was a $5.4 billion purchase of another security company, Mandiant.\n\nCommenting on the possible deal, Wedbush analysts said this would be a \"shot across the bow at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\"\n\n\"For Google this would be a shot across the bow at Microsoft and Amazon making a major bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship GCP offering in the cloud,\" the Wedbush analyst stated. \"This would give Google an edge on a number of cloud deployments and further monetize the cyber security cloud space with still less than 50% of the workloads not on the cloud globally.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle near deal to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for $23 billion - WSJ\n\nTSMC second-quarter profit seen jumping 30% on surging AI chip demand\n\nPro Research: Wall Street dives into Regeneron's robust prospects\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been the biggest technology disappointment of the century, so far, but it\u2019s still the most important tech company of this decade. Some are saying now is the time to buy Intel stock.\n\nIntel\u2019s failures over two decades came under a series of marketing executives. Its rise, if it is to happen, will be because of Pat Gelsinger. He\u2019s a manufacturing executive who started his career at Intel but was at VMWare when he was called back in early 2020. He understands fabrication.\n\nFabrication and Intel Stock\n\nGelsinger\u2019s strategy is to rebuild Intel as an American chip manufacturer, with new \u201cfabs\u201d in Ohio and Arizona, and substantial government help. Since he took command in February 2020, the stock has lost almost half its value.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGelsinger is putting $100 billion into his foundry plan over five years. Your tax dollars represent $8.5 billion of that. He says the company\u2019s goal is to have half the world\u2019s most advanced chips produced in the U.S. or Europe by the end of the decade.\n\nIntel moved its manufacturing offshore during the 20th century, most notably to China, because it was cheaper. Chinese workers earned less. China\u2019s environmental regulation was lax, and local protests easily ignored.\n\nIntel Foundry will have higher running costs, and Gelsinger will still hand off work to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) when necessary.\n\nIntel\u2019s Arrow Lake processors, due later this year, will have circuit lines just 2 nanometers apart. Intel calls this distance \u201c20 Angstroms,\u201d and plans to hit 18 Angstroms next year. In 2026 it hopes to reach 14 Angstroms.\n\nThe promise of this approach can be seen in the success of Taiwan Semiconductor, now best known for making Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. TSMC\u2019s stock is up 86% this year, 358% over the last five years, and it\u2019s now worth nearly 7 times Intel. Its market cap briefly touched $1 trillion recently before falling back.\n\nThe Bear Thesis\n\nIt\u2019s on the design side of chip making that Intel is getting killed.\n\nARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is licensing its Intel-compatible CPU design to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nNvidia is also licensing ARM technology for a gaming CPU, due out next year. Even if that chip is made at an Intel foundry, most of its value will be in the software.\n\nIntel still has four-fifths of the CPU market. It\u2019s hard to see that continuing in the face of the multi-ARM race that\u2019s coming.\n\nIntel should easily reach $55 billion in sales this year. But it had $79 billion in sales when Gelsinger took over. Profits are down 80% and the company is expected to earn just $1.01 per share this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two reasons why some analysts are putting Intel back on their buy lists. First is the expectation that those new foundries will soon generate a return. Second is its relative valuation, now just over twice sales, at a time when TSMC is selling for nearly 25 times sales and the AI tide keeps rising.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nInvestors have been sitting on losses in Intel for years now.\n\nAnalysts who, like me, have bought Gelsinger\u2019s promises, counseled patience, and bet on the foundry plan look very stupid right now.\n\nBut Intel is, as I\u2019ve said, the most essential company in the U.S.. If Intel can\u2019t make the foundry work, America\u2019s hopes of regaining the semiconductor market will go with it. So will a lot of your tax dollars.\n\nBut I\u2019m past taking promises at face value. Intel is running out of time. At TipRanks the professional analysts have mostly moved on. At Stocktwits, traders are neutral.\n\nIf Gelsinger can\u2019t get some profits out of the foundry soon, maybe it\u2019s time to sell out to the Chinese. If he can, watch out, because right now no one believes it.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in NVDA, TSM and INTC.

        "title": "These 3 Blue Chip Dividend Stocks Make Up 24% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here's My Top Pick.",
        "content": "Created in 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the best-known U.S. indexes. It is price-weighted, meaning its 30 components are weighted based on their stock prices rather than their market caps. This means that stock splits can have a major impact on the Dow.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH), and Goldman Sachs Group(NYSE: GS) are the three largest Dow components and all trade at over $460 a share. Together, they make up roughly 24% of the Dow,\u00a0whereas the average component holds a mere 3.3% weighting.\n\nAll three companies operate in vastly different industries but pay stable and growing dividends. Here's why Microsoft is my favorite pick out of the three. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIts broad-based exposure to growth\n\nThe simplest reason to buy and hold Microsoft is its exposure to trends and its leadership across industries. The company is a top player in cloud infrastructure, software and hardware for commercial customers and individual consumers, developer tools, enterprise software, and more.\n\nMicrosoft has done a masterful job monetizing artificial intelligence (AI) across its business. The company's generative AI tool, Copilot, probably has been the biggest update in the history of its Office 365 suite of software. Azure AI helps developers build intelligent cloud-native applications on the Azure platform.\n\nWhile other companies believe AI will help them accelerate growth in the future, Microsoft is already seeing significant profitability improvements across its business. It is a proven winner in AI, which is why it deserves a higher valuation than its historical average. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSince operating income is growing even faster than revenue, Microsoft's margins are hovering around 10-year highs, while sales have roughly doubled in the last five years. If it sustains impressive growth, it could help the company reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2035.\n\nMaintaining industry leadership\n\nIndustry-leading companies that can continue to grow can be great investments. But the tech sector is chock-full of great businesses that either no longer exist, were bought out on the cheap, or are a shell of what they used to be. That's why companies must invest in research and development and continue innovating.\n\nWhen I look at the mega-cap tech companies, Microsoft stands out as offering the best balance between stability and innovation.\n\nFor example, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is a significantly less expensive stock than Microsoft, but its business model is more fragile. Google Cloud is a distant third behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. YouTube is a powerhouse, but ChatGPT, TikTok, and Meta Platforms' Instagram are challenging Google's impenetrable moat in search. So while Alphabet is cheaper today, slower earnings growth could make it more expensive than Microsoft in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn sum, being more cautious when calling a company a surefire bet in tech is important. For stodgy companies like Coca-Cola or PepsiCo, the name of the game is to sustain quality brands, develop a pipeline of new products, and make savvy acquisitions.\n\nBut tech companies have to manage capital well and innovate. BlackBerry lost to Apple because it failed to pivot away from buttons to the touch screen. AOL faded into history when broadband replaced dial-up internet. The list goes on and on.\n\nMicrosoft not only has the diversification needed to take a market share hit in one of its business units, but it is also a proven innovator and excellent capital allocator that has been on the right side of the AI-led movement in tech.\n\nIts massive capital return program\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend every year since fiscal 2011. At the time, it paid a $0.16 per share quarterly dividend. Today, the dividend is $0.75 per share -- a nearly fivefold increase in just 14 years.\n\nMicrosoft's decision to consistently raise its dividend is a testament to its confidence that it can continue to grow earnings. With over $21 billion in trailing-12-month dividend expenses, it pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company (by far).\n\nAnd that's not all: Microsoft also buys back a ton of its own stock. Over the last 12 months, it has repurchased $16.8 billion of its stock compared to $10.5 billion in stock-based compensation.\n\nDue to its size and the tech industry's habit of rewarding employees with stock, Microsoft has to buy back at least as much stock as it pays in stock-based compensation to avoid diluting existing shareholders. It has been no easy challenge, as the company's stock-based compensation expense has doubled over the last five years. MSFT Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nOverall, Microsoft has committed to its capital return program by making annual (and significant) dividend raises while avoiding increasing its share count. The payout only yields 0.6%, but that's because the stock has posted massive outsize gains. The dividend is up 477% over the last 15 years, but the stock is up 1,870%.\n\nFor the dividend yield to increase, the dividend has to grow faster than the stock price. Microsoft's last five dividend raises were all around 10%. So if the stock cools off, we could see the yield increase.\n\nEither way, Microsoft is an underrated dividend stock heavily committed to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIt deserves a premium valuation\n\nMicrosoft is arguably the best company in the world due to its current position, high-margin growth trajectory, and ability to fund a sizable dividend and stock-buyback programs with cash.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the stock is its 40.3 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 10-year median P/E of 30.6. However, Microsoft is a much better business now than in the past, especially given the growth of cloud infrastructure and the AI improvements across proven products.\n\nIn this regard, Microsoft's valuation is more reasonable than it appears at first glance. The company will have to maintain an impressive growth rate to keep this high multiple, but it has what it takes. Investors interested in quality companies, even at a premium price, should consider Microsoft now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran. Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\n\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\n\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\n\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\n\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) Best AI Value Stock That is \u2018Money Machine\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran?\n\nMicrosoft Corp Inc (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\n\nMSFT is one of the top members of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodoran called AI \u201cvalue\u201d stocks that have become \u201cmoney machines.\u201d In September last year, he said MSFT was one of the direct beneficiaries of AI and that\u2019s why \u201csome\u201d of its stock rally was \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\n\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\n\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a leading technology company specializing in software, hardware, cloud services, AI and digital applications, was one of the largest contributors during the quarter. The company continues to execute on a myriad of catalysts across its businesses, particularly within cloud\u2010based applications like Azure and platform\u2010based servicessuch as LinkedIn. For Azure, Microsoft detailed previously announced partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD to develop first\u2010party silicon chips and custom\u2010 designed infrastructure innovations, including its AI accelerator (Azure Maia) and CPU (Azure Cobalt). These advancements are part of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to enhance AI performance and efficiency within the Azure ecosystem. LinkedIn, which has more than doubled its membership to over one billion in the past four years, is expanding its revenue streams across subscriptions and advertising and increasingly disrupting traditional recruiting and training functions. LinkedIn recently passed $16 billion in run rate annual revenue, which is only ~7% of total Microsoft revenue, but if it were a standalone business, it would be in the top half of S&P 500 constituents! The Azure and LinkedIn examples are just two of many that illustrate Microsoft\u2019s ongoing transformation from an operating system to a total technology solutions provider.\u201d\n\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July.

        "title": "Billionaire Hedge Fund Managers' 2 Favorite Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks (Hint: Nvidia Isn't 1 of Them)",
        "content": "\"Follow the money.\"\n\nThat phrase gained notoriety during the Watergate scandal five decades ago. However, it could be useful for investors today looking for stocks to buy.\n\nMuch of the big money has poured into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the last two years. Nvidia has been an especially significant beneficiary of this trend, with its shares skyrocketing over 9x since the beginning of 2023.\n\nBut where would following the money lead investors now? Here are billionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks -- and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThe top hedge fund billionaires\n\nForbes ranked the wealthiest hedge fund managers of 2023. The top 10 were:\n\nRank Manager Hedge Fund Net Worth (as of 3/10/23) 1 Ken Griffin Citadel $35 billion 2 Jim Simons Renaissance Technologies $28.1 billion 3 Ray Dalio Bridgewater Associates $19.1 billion 4 David Tepper Appaloosa Management $18.5 billion 5 Steve Cohen Point72 Asset Management $17.5 billion 6 Carl Icahn Icahn Enterprises $17.5 billion 7 Michael Platt BlueCrest Capital Management $16 billion 8 Israel Englander Millennium Management $11.5 billion 9 Chase Coleman Tiger Global Management $8.5 billion 10 David Shaw D.E. Shaw & Co. $7.9 billion\n\nData source: Forbes.\n\nJim Simons has since passed away, although his Renaissance Technologies hedge fund remains active. The net worths of the other nine hedge fund managers have changed somewhat since last year, but they're all still multibillionaires.\n\nMost of these billionaire hedge fund managers have invested heavily in AI. Carl Icahn stands out as a notable exception. None of Icahn Enterprises' holdings are AI-related. Michael Platt's BlueCrest Capital also has no AI stocks among its top positions.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund managers' two favorite AI stocks\n\nHowever, two AI stocks, in particular, are arguably the favorites of the other billionaire hedge fund managers. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) ranked in the top five holdings of seven of the 10 richest hedge fund managers on Forbes' list based on their latest regulatory filings. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) wasn't too far behind, landing in the top five for half the 10 wealthiest hedge fund managers.\n\nSteve Cohen and Israel England like Amazon the most. The e-commerce and cloud services leader is the largest holding for Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and England's Millennium Management. Amazon is the second-largest holding for David Tepper's Appaloosa Management.\n\nMicrosoft ranks as the No. 1 position for David Shaw's D.E. Shaw & Co. It's the second-largest holding for Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management. And while the tech giant isn't Ken Griffin's biggest position for his Citadel fund, Microsoft is his top AI stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRunners up\n\nAlthough Nvidia wasn't one of billionaire hedge managers' top two favorite AI stocks, it was a close runner-up. The graphics processing unit (GPU) maker was in the top five holdings for four of Forbes' 10 richest hedge fund managers. Perhaps surprisingly, though, Nvidia wasn't the No. 1 AI stock for any of them.\n\nMeta Platforms wasn't too far behind either. It ranked in the top five holdings for three of the individuals on Forbes' list. Meta is the largest position for Coleman's Tiger Global Management.\n\nShould you buy Amazon and Microsoft too?\n\nNo one should buy a stock only to follow in the footsteps of billionaire investors. However, I think Amazon and Microsoft have a lot going for them.\n\nAmazon is the world's largest cloud services provider. AI should provide a long-term tailwind for the company's Amazon Web Services unit. Amazon is also using AI extensively in its e-commerce operations to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\nMicrosoft continues to reap the rewards from its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. It has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 throughout its products. The company is the second-largest cloud service provider and should benefit from the same AI tailwind as Amazon.\n\nAs customers continue to move to the cloud to build and deploy AI models, Amazon's and Microsoft's revenue and earnings should grow significantly. Share prices tend to rise with earnings growth over the long term. I view Amazon and Microsoft as great AI stocks to buy right now. Just follow the AI money.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Alibaba\n\nAt first glance, investors may find it puzzling that Appaloosa Management, the fund run by billionaire David Tepper, took a position in Alibaba. In 2022, the stock faced a delisting threat when the Chinese company resisted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to see its internal financial audits because of its association with the Chinese Communist Party. Although the U.S. and China eventually resolved that issue, the tenuous relationship between the countries put tremendous pressure on the stock.\n\nAs a result of the turmoil, Alibaba's stock price fell to almost 20% less than its initial public offering (IPO) price from 10 years ago. This drop comes despite Alibaba's net income more than tripling over that time. That caused its P/E ratio to fall briefly into the single digits, and its current earnings multiple of 18 is far below any comparable conglomerate.\n\nWith the stock trading at a heavily discounted price, Tepper increased the size of his Alibaba position by more than 11,000% over the last year. The markets may vindicate this move over time. The stock price has remained steady so far this year, though it is down about 75% from its 2020 high.\n\nStill, if Alibaba can find a way to ease investor concerns, Tepper's fund and those who invest along with him could experience a significant payday as the stock finally prices in its growing profits.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been a top AI innovator since it introduced the technology to its Google Search platform in 2001. Nonetheless, AI investors soured on the stock when OpenAI introduced a vastly improved version of ChatGPT in early 2023, creating the impression that the Google parent was behind the curve.\n\nStory continues\n\nBillionaire investors like Bill Ackman saw this as a buying opportunity, so much so that 13% of his Pershing Square portfolio is tied up in this stock. As late as the fourth quarter of 2022, Pershing Square did not own any Alphabet stock.\n\nBuying at the time Pershing Square did may have been the right move. More recently, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product, Google Gemini. It has also combined its AI research under the Google DeepMind umbrella. Considering its $108 billion in liquidity, it will likely buy any AI innovation it cannot invent in-house.\n\nAdditionally, despite perceptions, the stock has risen by around 60% over the last year, and its 29 P/E ratio makes it the most inexpensive company with a market cap above $2 trillion. That positions Alphabet to offer both safety and a higher likelihood of further gains.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nThe opportunity in Microsoft was of particular interest to Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of the Duquesne Family Office fund. He saw that Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, had returned the tech giant to prominence as a leader in cloud computing.\n\nSucceeding in the cloud today means leading in AI. Druckenmiller began buying shares at the low point of the 2022 bear market and increased the purchases as Microsoft's partnership with generative AI specialist OpenAI came to light. Now, it makes up around 11% of the Duquesne fund.\n\nThe company built on that deal, integrating search engine Bing with ChatGPT to better enable it to compete with Google Search. Additionally, it launched Copilot, an AI-powered chatbot that combines the ChatGPT large language model and Microsoft's tools to create deliverables on command through one's natural language.\n\nAmid its innovations, it holds around $80 billion in liquidity, giving it tremendous optionality. Indeed, optimism around AI has helped Microsoft stock rise by nearly 40% over the last year.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of about 39, Microsoft has become a moderately valued AI stock, but given its resources and leadership in AI, the stock should continue to rise over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alibaba Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks Paving Your Path to Seven-Figure Wealth",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has triggered a multi-year investment cycle across the enterprise. Additionally, generative AI is now permeating various consumer internet applications. These trends bode well for AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nIn Q1 of fiscal year 2024, a huge moment of clarity appeared on AI spending as cloud service providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) increased their capital expenditure plans. Indeed, it was a stark reminder of the heavy investment needed to make AI applications and products a reality. Bank of America projects capex for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon will increase by $37 billion in 2024 to $145 billion.\n\nMoreover, according to Capital Group, big tech giants are raising their capital expenditure budgets and will spend an estimated $500 billion over the next three years. This spending will go toward chips, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Plus, a substantial proportion will cover memory, servers and network equipment. This means more profits will flow to these three AI wealth-building stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustom ASICs have emerged as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s H100 and B200 GPUs. After Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is the second-largest player in this fast-growing high-end market, with a 13-15% share.\n\nJPMorgan analysts are bullish on Marvell Technology as one of the AI wealth-building stocks to buy. They forecast that the high-end ASIC market will grow to between $20 and $30 billion. Additionally, due to demand from generative AI, this market will grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate.\n\nBuoyed by this growth, the company\u2019s AI revenues could skyrocket. Notably, the chip maker is working with various big tech companies on custom silicon. It has been collaborating with Google on its 5-nanometer Axion ARM CPU chip and Amazon on its 5-nanometer Tranium chip. Additionally, rumors are buzzing that it\u2019s working with Microsoft on its Maia chip and Amazon on its Inferentia chip.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, JPMorgan analysts think MRVL could generate $1.6 to $1.8 billion in revenues from networking and custom ASICs this year. Moreover, they expect AI revenues to double next year. Additionally, most analysts are extremely bullish, with 28 buy ratings and a median price target of $90, representing over 20% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a 10% pullback, it is time to buy Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The memory maker is among the best-positioned AI wealth-building stocks due to its high bandwidth memory (HBM). Importantly, HBM memory reduces bottlenecks, increasing training efficiency for large language models.\n\nAlthough Micron Technology tumbled after Q3 of FY 2024 earnings, the results were stellar. The company blew past estimates, reporting revenues of $6.81 billion for the third quarter against estimates of $6.67 billion. Data center drove the strength as AI demand led to 50% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) growth in the segment. Furthermore, the company grew its share in high-margin AI products such as data center solid-state drives and HBM.\n\nAnother impressive highlight was the company disclosing that HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and 2025. Due to robust demand, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sanjay Mehrotra noted in Q3 prepared remarks that Micron Technology was on track for record FY 2024 revenues. Besides, he expects this momentum to carry over into FY 2025.\n\nIndeed, MU is set for a banner FY 2025 due to AI demand, making it one of the top AI wealth-building stocks. Moreover, an ongoing shift from commoditized memory to high-margin AI products will boost profitability.\n\nASML Holding N.Y. (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAs demand for AI accelerates, semiconductor foundries and integrated device manufacturers are scrambling to increase capacity. This ramp-up spells opportunity for ASML Holding N.Y. (NASDAQ:ASML), the maker of EUV machines used to manufacture chips.\n\nSeveral reasons prevail for maintaining a bullish stance on ASML. First, AI-related revenue is soaring due to memory demand driven by advanced memories such as HBM and DDR5. As a result, the semiconductor equipment maker is seeing increasing orders from memory makers like Micron Technology.\n\nSecondly, the firm benefits from increased subsidies and grants to the semiconductor sector. Due to incentives and grants from laws such as the CHIPS and Science Act, chip manufacturers are opening new facilities. For instance, Micron Technology is constructing new fabs in New York and Idaho. In line with this expansion, it will spend $8 billion of capex in 2024 and increase it to a mid-30s percentage of revenue in 2025.\n\nThe outlook for ASML is very positive. Almost every foundry and integrated device maker is constructing new chip manufacturing facilities. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have broken ground on new projects in the U.S. and Europe. These facilities will be filled with ASML equipment, making the stock a top buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Recession-Proof Utility Stocks to Power Up Your Portfolio This July",
        "content": "Recession-proof utility stocks have always been stable dividend payers, making them popular long-term investments. But new exponential demand driven by artificial intelligence transforms these Wall Street wallflowers into high-growth AI plays. According to Goldman Sachs Research analysts, AI is set to drive a 160% increase in data center power demand. With interest rates potentially lowering this year, now is an opportune time to power up portfolios with utilities.\n\nThese stocks carry interest rate risk that can draw conservative investors away when rates rise. However, with Treasury yields declining and grid infrastructure requiring upgrades to meet swelling power demand, utilities may soon shine brighter. As Exelon\u2019s CEO predicts, electricity consumption from Chicago\u2019s data centers alone could jump 900%, rivaling multiple nuclear plants. Beyond dividends, growth potential is why Goldman Sachs touts utilities as an alternative way to tap the AI boom. Some companies are bracing for up to 80% sales jumps from data centers. Yet valuations don\u2019t account for this pending surge.\n\nThat disconnect signals an underpriced upside, perfect for investors wanting AI exposure without overpaying for tech stocks basking in the hype. As AI transforms utilities from merely recession-proof to growth-charged, their stocks could electrify portfolios with power to spare this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the U.S.\u2019s largest electric utilities and renewable energy companies, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has established itself as one of the top recession-proof utility stocks. Its subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is America\u2019s largest electric utility, serving over 12 million people. It also projects continued strong growth, with over 100,000 new customers added in the first quarter of 2024 alone.\n\nDespite economic downturns, people still need electricity, which provides NextEra Energy with steady revenue. For 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share between $3.23 to $3.43. It also plans to grow its dividends per share by 10% through 2026. NextEra Energy Resources, its renewable energy subsidiary, also had a record quarter. Thus, it added 2,765 megawatts of solar and storage projects to its portfolio.\n\nWith renewable energy demand rapidly rising to power data centers and AI technology, NextEra Energy is positioned to capitalize through its $85-95 billion infrastructure investments planned through 2025. Over the next decade, FPL expects a huge boost in renewable energy production. Therefore, it\u2019s projected to increase from 6% to 38% of total solar generation and a doubling of battery storage. So, while recessions may negatively impact other stocks, NextEra Energy\u2019s essential electric services, strong earnings, dividend growth, and pivotal role in the renewable energy transition make it a stable, recession-proof utility stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthern Company (SO) the southern company logo displayed several times on a screen\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthern Company (NYSE:SO), the Atlanta-based energy giant, has established itself as one of the more stable recession-proof utility stocks. Its operations across electricity and natural gas position it well to provide consistent shareholder returns regardless of economic conditions.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Southern Company reported strong financials. This included $6.6 billion in operating revenues and $1.3 billion in earnings before income taxes. It also achieved $1.1 billion in net income available to shareholders. These represent respectable year-over-year growth rates of 2.6%, 44.4%, and 31.0%, respectively. Southern\u2019s earnings per share also grew from $0.79 in Q1 2023 to $1.03 in Q1 2024.\n\nSouthern\u2019s regulated electric and gas utilities are a fundamental factor that makes it recession-proof. The latter generate steady revenues across business cycles. For example, in Q1 2024, the company saw 1.7% weather-adjusted retail sales growth. Additionally, it added over 75,000 new utility customers. Southern also has major infrastructure projects, like the recently completed Plant Vogtle nuclear facility in Georgia, which will supply carbon-free energy to over 1 million homes and businesses for decades.\n\nWith strong operational performance, consistent customer growth, and long-term clean energy investments, Southern has shown resilience regardless of the economy. For these reasons, Southern remains a stable choice among recession-proof utility stocks.\n\nWEC Energy Group (WEC) WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC), headquartered in Wisconsin, is one of the Midwest\u2019s biggest electric and natural gas utility holding firms. With a focus on reliable service and consistent dividend growth, WEC qualifies as one of the top recession-proof utility stocks.\n\nA critical factor that makes WEC Energy recession-proof is its impressive record of dividend growth. The company has increased its dividend for 21 consecutive years, with a 7% dividend raise announced in January 2024 to $3.34 per share. This stability results from consistent earnings growth, with 2023 adjusted earnings per share rising 4% to $4.63. Even in times of economic uncertainty, households and businesses still need electricity and heating, allowing WEC\u2019s profits to remain steady.\n\nIn addition, WEC Energy intends to pay out 65-70% of its earnings as dividends. With a forward dividend yield of 3.7% based on the newly announced dividend rate, the stock offers an attractive income stream for investors. This aligns with the company\u2019s focus on shareholder returns.\n\nWe Energies, a subsidiary of WEC Energy, has also just obtained approval for a $300 million distribution project in Mount Pleasant, where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is building its new data center campus and investing $3.3 billion to spur AI innovation. Therefore, for investors seeking a defensive stock that can weather market volatility but with AI exposure, WEC Energy stands out in the utility sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Microsoft Next?",
        "content": "Amid the stock split talk, investors need to keep Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in mind. The current price of around $460 per share is well below the nominal prices at which stocks like Broadcom or Nvidia recently announced splits.\n\nAdmittedly, it might be presumptuous to say that Microsoft is the next stock split. Many stocks are soaring to very high triple-digit prices amid an improving economy and game-changing market shifts in the tech sector. However, Microsoft differs from these names in one key area, which could prompt a split sooner rather than later.\n\nWhy Microsoft may split soon\n\nPut simply, Microsoft may split soon because it is one of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Unlike the other major indexes, the Dow is a price-weighted index. This means stocks with high nominal prices have disproportionate sway over the index score.\n\nAdmittedly, the index's price-weighting approach remains controversial. So far, Berkshire Hathaway has allowed its shares to maintain a very high price rather than seek inclusion in the Dow. Nonetheless, other companies like Microsoft value being a Dow component and will probably bow to pressure to split its stock to maintain that status.\n\nThat pressure could come soon as it is among the highest-priced stocks in the Dow 30. It closely approximates Goldman Sachs's current price and is close in price to UnitedHealth Group, which sells at around $505 per share right now.\n\nAdditionally, investors may recall that Dow component Apple initiated a 4-for-1 stock split in August 2020 when its pre-split price was close to $500 per share. Thus, it should not surprise anyone if Microsoft were to announce a stock split in short order.\n\nThe growth of Microsoft\n\nInvestors should also remember that Microsoft is, ultimately, a stock split candidate because of its underlying business growth. The company's paradigm shifted after Satya Nadella became CEO in February 2014.\n\nNadella's most notable accomplishment was making Microsoft more of a cloud-oriented business, shifting its software products to the cloud and making them mobile-friendly. Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft's Azure became the second-most popular cloud infrastructure platform, lagging behind only Amazon's Amazon Web Services, which pioneered the industry. Image source: Statista.\n\nAlso, Nadella made Microsoft more artificial intelligence (AI)-oriented. The company partnered with OpenAI to link its search engine to ChatGPT. Through this, it launched Copilot, a chatbot powered by generative AI. This partnership also linked ChatGPT with its Bing search engine, making Microsoft a credible competitive threat to Alphabet's search business.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Microsoft's market cap has grown to over $3.4 trillion, making it one of the world's largest publicly traded companies.\u00a0Given that the cloud and AI will probably continue growing for years to come, the company's growth would eventually make a split necessary, even without the association with the Dow.\n\nThe coming Microsoft stock split\n\nUltimately, when Microsoft will next split its stock is unclear, but a split is likely coming soon.\n\nAdmittedly, its position as one of the Dow 30 stocks is likely to hasten a split. Allowing Microsoft's stock price to climb much further without a softening stock split could give the software giant an uncomfortably strong influence over the popular market index. However, investors should probably credit the company's tech-driven growth for making the split necessary in the first place.\n\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft is back on the cutting edge of tech and has positioned itself as a major force in the cloud and AI industries.

        "content": "ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its \u201cClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. U.S. stocks increased during a difficult quarter for diversified portfolios due to the market leadership remaining centered around a few mega-cap firms that were thought to be the major winners in the expanding AI industry. The benchmark Russell 3000 Index returned 3.22% in the quarter. The strategy underperformed the benchmark in the second quarter and had gains in four of 10 sectors in which it was invested, on an absolute basis. Overall stock selection detracted the most, mainly stock selection in the IT, consumer discretionary, health care, industrials, and real estate sectors. Please check the top 5 holdings of the strategy, to know its best pick in 2024.\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter.

        "title": "3 Red-Hot Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The stock market broadly has had an excellent year so far -- the S&P 500 is up 17%. Naturally, some hot stocks have outpaced that growth, and while it might seem counter-intuitive, some of the stocks with big gains already behind them could still be among the best places for investors to deploy their investing dollars now.\n\nHere are three growth stocks that have outpaced the market year to date, but that also have strong competitive positions that make them worth buying today and holding well into the future.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nSince artificial intelligence (AI) has become the hottest topic on Wall Street, much of the attention has been on high-end semiconductor companies like Nvidia, which have been putting up eye-popping results quarter after quarter. However, investors shouldn't forget that Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is at the forefront of the AI boom due in large part to its investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft has already added AI features to several of its products, and because of the reach of its product suite, many consumers have already started to see them in action. For example, the Copilot tool that it has added to productivity applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint can help users draft documents and analyze data more easily.\n\nAI is impacting Microsoft's business in other ways as well. In its most recently reported fiscal quarter, revenue from its Azure cloud unit increased by 31% year over year, with 7 percentage points of growth coming from AI alone. Overall revenue grew by 17% to $62 billion, while earnings per share increased by 20%.\n\nMicrosoft is a leader in the software and cloud infrastructure space, and its AI investments are likely to strengthen its position for years to come.\n\nApple\n\nAt first, it seemed like Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was behind when it came to AI. While other tech companies were garnering headlines for their AI-related activities, there wasn't much news coming from the iPhone maker. That all changed last month when it held its annual developer conference, where it unveiled Apple Intelligence, which will roll out later this year.\n\nWhat's most important about Apple's foray into AI is how it will reinforce its ecosystem. Its new AI features are only going to be available on newer devices, which should drive some degree of an upgrade cycle. Additionally, while these features will be free when they debut, one could imagine a scenario where some aspects of its AI offering become part of a subscription service. This would give a boost to Apple's fast-growing services segment, which is currently its second-largest revenue source after iPhone sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is already one of the largest companies in the world and boasts one of the most recognizable brands. If its efforts in AI can continue to drive consumers to buy more of its devices and subscribe to more of its services, the stock could continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nWith so much attention being focused on the few companies making the types of cutting-edge semiconductor chips that can power AI, it's easy to overlook a company like Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN), which manufactures a wide range of less powerful chips that are needed for everyday uses and products. From your microwave oven to the entertainment center in your car, chips are nearly everywhere, and Texas Instruments makes a lot of them.\n\nYear to date, Texas Instruments' stock is up 18%. However, that run has only brought the stock back to its late 2021 level, reflecting the struggles the company has experienced over the past few years.\n\nIt's important to remember that the semiconductor industry is cyclical, and outside of the high-powered AI chip niche, the industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the past year or so. Texas Instruments' revenue and net income have declined, which is typical during these kinds of downturns.\n\nThe bottom line is that Texas Instrument plays a vital role in the semiconductor space, and down cycles like the current one are normal. The fact that the stock price is up year to date despite the company's declines on the top and bottom lines demonstrates Wall Street's belief that these market conditions will be a short-term challenge for it. Over the long term, Texas Instruments remains a solid business worth buying now and holding for the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "SoundHound AI Stock May Be Poised for a Correction. Be Careful.",
        "content": "There\u2019s a great deal to like about Soundhound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) stock at this point. Its exposure to the AI megatrend, alliance with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and strong, overall growth are all in its favor.\n\nHowever, given the stock\u2019s recent, overdone rally, along with the name\u2019s extremely high valuation and significant competition, I recommend that investors hold the shares but avoid buying them.\n\nSoundhound AI Stock\u2019s Many Positive Attributes\n\nSoundhound, which produces an AI-powered voice assistant used by businesses, is benefiting from being part of the AI megatrend that is being embraced by investors and many companies. Partly as a result of this situation, Soundhound AI stock soared 157% between the beginning of the year and the afternoon of July 11.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fact many companies seek to save money by implementing AI-powered tools likely helped Soundhound successfully convince many to adopt its offerings. That is a huge factor behind Soundhound\u2019s impressive growth. Last quarter, the firm\u2019s top line surged 73% versus the same period a year earlier to $11.6 million while its cumulative subscriptions & bookings backlog soared about 80% year-over-year to a very impressive $682 million.\n\nFinally, Soundhound\u2019s alliance with Nvidia boosted SoundhoundAI stock while also lifting financial results. In February, the chip giant disclosed that it purchased almost $3.7 million of Soundhound AI stock. The information undoubtedly lit a fire under Soundhound\u2019s shares, as its stock surged from $2.26 on Feb. 14, the day before the news was disclosed, to $8.24 on March 18. Although the shares subsequently sharply retreated, Nvidia\u2019s investment in Soundhound has put the latter company on many investors\u2019 radar and made them excited about its outlook.\n\nAlso importantly, the company\u2019s association with Nvidia has undoubtedly helped it obtain more customers since firms are likely impressed by the investment.\n\nAfterall, Soundhound\u2019s list of customers is impressive. Among them are Applebee\u2019s, Church\u2019s Chicken, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA),Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMLY).\n\nA Potentially Overdone Rally\n\nOn July 10, SoundHound announced Stellantis began including \u201cits\u00a0SoundHound Chat AI\u00a0voice assistant with integrated ChatGPT\u201d in its \u201cPeugeot, Opel and Vauxhall vehicle brands across 11 European markets.\u201d The news sparked a huge rally in SoundHound AI stock.\n\nNot surprisingly, SoundHound did not reveal the financial terms of the deal. But as a longtime investor in BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), I know the royalties software makers obtain from auto companies can be quite low. For example, BlackBerry historically only received $1.50 to $5 per vehicle for its infotainment offering. It also received as little as $5 per vehicle for its more advanced technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat\u2019s more, SoundHound began providing voice AI systems for Stellantis last year. That means this new deal may not produce large revenue increases for the tech firm.\n\nValuation and Competition\n\nBy any measure, the valuation of Soundhound AI stock is quite elevated. The shares have a forward price-to-sales ratio of over 17 times. Its enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is a gigantic 30.5 times.\n\nAs I noted in a previous column, the company reportedly has many competitors. Amomg them are Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\u00a0Further, a company called Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) is said to have taken automotive customers away from Soundhound in the past.\n\nThe Bottom Line on SoundHound AI Stock\n\nI believe that SoundhoundAI has a bright future. However, given the company\u2019s high valuation, its many tough competitors and the market\u2019s exuberance about its deal with Stellantis, I expect the shares to drop significantly below their current levels in the medium term.\n\nSuch a downturn could occur because Soundhound reports weaker-than-expected quarterly results or because it loses a key customer. Alternatively, a correction by the stock market could cause the company\u2019s share price to drop sharply.\n\nConsequently, I recommend investors wait for a meaningful pullback before pulling the trigger rather than chasing it in the wake of its recent rally. However, investors who already own the shares should hold onto them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in BB.

        "title": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Knows How To Allocate Capital Effectively",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$107b \u00f7 (US$484b - US$119b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 7.5%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Microsoft  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Microsoft compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Microsoft's ROCE Trend?\n\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 75%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microsoft thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 249% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\n\nLike most companies, Microsoft does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nMicrosoft is not the only stock earning high returns.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) facilitates online transactions globally. The company\u2019s total payment volume (TPV) for Q1 2024 was $403.9 billion. A considerable increase reflects the platform\u2019s extensive usage and trust among users. This 14% increase in TPV points to PayPal\u2019s moat in the digital payment sector and its ability to handle vast transaction volumes sharply. The transaction margin dollars, which grew by\u00a04% to $3.5 billion,\u00a0are another essential metric. Although slightly below the top-line growth rate, this growth indicates an improvement in operational edge and profitability per transaction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, PayPal\u2019s EPS increased by 27% annually, reaching $1.08, reflecting the company\u2019s ability to boost market value through sharp cost management and strategic reinvestments. Meanwhile, operating income increased by\u00a015% to $1.4 billion, demonstrating effective cost management and operational edge. The operating margin grew by 0.84% to 18.2%. Hence, these improvements reflect the company\u2019s ability to generate higher profits from its revenue.\n\nIn short, PayPal is on the stocks to buy list based on growth in total payment volume, sharp transaction margins, and an uplift in the bottom line.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) leads in CPUs and other computing technologies. The company can secure considerable deals, highlighted by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the fifth Intel 18A customer and updating the lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion. Indeed, the roadmap extension with Intel 14A marks Intel\u2019s tech advancements.\u00a0This\u00a0is the first process node in the industry to use High Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet (High NA EUV) technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, the\u00a0grants and tax incentives from the CHIPS Act derive massive financial support.\u00a0This\u00a0enables large-scale investments (CapEx) in research and manufacturing capabilities.\u00a0Intel\u2019s aim of hitting five nodes in four years, while ambitious, is on track. This rapid node transition is crucial for maintaining technological leadership and competitiveness in the semiconductor industry.\n\nMoreover, the production ramp of products like Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake may initiate in H1 2025. This positions Intel to capitalize on these new technologies, like AI. The sequence of product launches with advanced node availability ensures that Intel remains at the forefront of high-growth tech markets.\n\nIn summary, Intel\u2019s presence on the stocks to buy list is led by its technological advancements and large contract deals.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) produces and distributes films, TV series, and digital content. The company\u2019s content pipeline is robust. Numerous high-impact projects are scheduled over 2024-2025. This includes new seasons of massively followed series like House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, and The Last of Us. There are also major film releases like Joker 2. The release of new Lord of the Rings movies starting in 2026 is vital, given the franchise\u2019s appeal and historical leads.\n\nAdditionally, the company is also investing in new\u00a0technologies like AI. AI is used to personalize content discovery, optimize ad placements, and streamline various processes.\u00a0This tech integration may derive sharp consumer experiences and increase the efficacy of marketing and ad sales. The company has considerable leads in deleveraging, repaying $1.1 billion of debt in Q1 and more than $6 billion over the past 12 months.\u00a0This\u00a0has reduced interest expenses and improved the company\u2019s financial flexibility.\n\nTo conclude, Warner Bros. is a high mark on the stocks to buy list based on its robust content pipeline and investments in AI-driven technologies.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in PYPL, INTC and WBD.

        "title": "US senators call out Big Tech's new approach to poaching talent, products from smaller AI startups",
        "content": "In the race to stay ahead in artificial intelligence, the biggest technology companies are swallowing up the talent and products of innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.\n\nSan Francisco-based Adept announced a deal late last month that will send its CEO and key employees to Amazon and give the e-commerce giant a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.\n\nSome call it a \u201creverse acqui-hire.\u201d Others call it poaching. Whatever it's called, it's alarming to some in Washington who see it as an attempt to bypass U.S. laws that protect against monopolies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the massive consolidation that\u2019s going on in AI,\u201d U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe technical lingo is \u2018up and down the stack\u2019. But, in plain English, a few companies control a major portion of the market, and just concentrate \u2014 rather than on innovation \u2014 trying to buy out everybody else\u2019s talent.\u201d\n\nSo-called \u201cacqui-hires,\u201d in which one company acquires another to absorb talent, have been common in the tech industry for decades, said Michael A. Cusumano, a business professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But what\u2019s happening in the AI industry is a little different.\n\n\u201cTo acquire only some employees or the majority, but not all, license technology, leave the company functioning but not really competing, that\u2019s a new twist,\u201d Cusumano said.\n\nA similar maneuver happened at the AI company Inflection in March when Microsoft hired its co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman to head up Microsoft's consumer AI business, along with Inflection's chief scientist and several of its top engineers and researchers. That arrangement has already attracted some scrutiny from regulators, particularly in Europe.\n\nWyden also wants U.S. regulators to investigate the Amazon-Adept deal. He sent a letter Friday urging antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission that \u201csustained, pointed action is necessary to fight undue consolidation across the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on here is instead of buying startups outright, big tech companies are trying a new play,\" Wyden said in an interview before sending the letter. \u201dThey don\u2019t want to formally acquire the companies, avoiding the antitrust scrutiny. I think that\u2019s going to be the playbook until the FTC really starts digging into these deals.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration and lawmakers from both parties have championed stronger oversight of the tech industry in recent years, likely scaring off big acquisitions that might have sailed through in earlier eras. U.S. antitrust enforcers, for example, plan on investigating the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom, with the Department of Justice looking into chipmaker Nvidia and the Federal Trade Commission scrutinizing business partners Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Google, are trying to be conservative and not make too many acquisitions in the AI space, Cusumano said.\n\n\u201cIt seems clever. I would think, though, that they\u2019re not fooling anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nFor smaller AI startups, the problem is also that building AI systems is expensive, requiring costly computer chips, power-hungry data centers, huge troves of data to train upon and highly skilled computer scientists.\n\nAdept, which aims to make AI software agents that help people with workplace tasks, said it was trying to do two things at once \u2014 build the foundational AI technology as well as the products for end users. But continuing on that path \u201cwould\u2019ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision,\u201d it said in a statement explaining the Amazon deal.\n\n\u201cThey may have made a decision that they have no real future and just don\u2019t have deep enough pockets to compete in this space, so they probably prefer to be acquired outright,\" Cusumano said. \"But if Amazon is not willing or not able to do that, then this is kind of a second-best approach for them.\u201d\n\nWyden has long taken an interest in technology, helping to write the 1996 law that helped set the ground rules for free speech on the internet. He said he generally favors a straightforward approach that encourages innovation, with guardrails as needed.\n\nBut in the AI industry, he said, \u201ccompanies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, either own major parts of the AI ecosystem or they have a leg up thanks to their massive resources.\u201d\n\nJohn F. Coyle, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, said he believes that Amazon hiring Adept employees without buying the company is clearly a move to avoid antitrust problems. But that type of hiring isn\u2019t a \u201creverse acqui-hire,\u201d he said.\n\nAcqui-hires are typically face-saving moves that can be spun into success stories, Coyle said, and provide an alternative to liquidating a business. A smaller company can say it was sold to Amazon or Facebook and spin it as a positive, for example, even if wasn\u2019t the founders\u2019 original plan.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t an acqui-hire. This is a straight up poach,\u201d Coyle said of Amazon and Adept.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just happen in the tech world, he said, calling the move \u201ca version of a very old story.\u201d In his class, Coyle said, he teaches students about a case from the 1950s involving an advertising agency in New York City. Some employees left to start a new business and poached roughly 100 others to come to work for them.\n\n\u201cThere are innumerable instances where one company went and raided another to take all their employees,\" Coyle said. \"That existed before the acqui-hire, that is going to happen after the acqui-hire.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Nvidia Is Slowly Becoming The IBM Of The AI Era' Says Former AMD And Tesla Engineer. Here's The Problem With That Comparison\n\nJim Keller, a well-known engineer who\u2019s worked at AMD and Tesla and now leads the AI company Tenstorrent, recently said something interesting on the DemystifySci podcast. He thinks Nvidia is becoming like IBM back in the day but in the AI world. While this shows how powerful Nvidia is right now in AI hardware, it also raises some concerns.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500. Mark Cuban believes \u201cthe next wave of revenue generation is around real estate and entertainment\u201d \u2014 this new real estate fund allows you to get started with low minimum investment.\n\nNvidia\u2019s smart move to focus on AI early has paid off big time \u2014 its earnings were over $26 billion in the first quarter of 2024. It\u2019s also one of the top three companies in the world by market valuation, breathing down the necks of Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe company is now a major player in the AI hardware market, with its powerful GPUs used by tech giants like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta. It seems that everyone is on the Nvidia hype train, as CEO Jensen Huang calls AI the \"next industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia at the center.\n\nKeller, an extremely accomplished engineer and entrepreneur, knows what he\u2019s talking about. However, he might not realize just how unfortunate his comment that \"Nvidia is slowly becoming the IBM of the AI era\" is.\n\nIn the early 1980s, IBM was huge in the personal computer market. Their PCs were everywhere, and saying \"PC\" often meant you were talking about an IBM machine. But, IBM\u2019s reign didn\u2019t last long because of a few key mistakes and growing competition.\n\nTrending: Sun Belt's booming real estate market prepares for millions of new inhabitants \u2014 Here\u2019s how to find the region's best deals!\n\nIBM\u2019s strategy of using an open architecture helped it dominate the market initially, but it also made it easy for other companies to make IBM-compatible PCs. These competitors sold similar products at lower prices, which ate into IBM's market share.\n\nThe partnership between IBM and Microsoft also backfired as Bill Gates\u2019 company retained the rights to sell its operating system (MS-DOS) to other companies, paving the way for the rise of Microsoft Windows.\n\nAs PC Gamer reports, as Windows became the dominant operating system, PCs became more associated with Microsoft than IBM. IBM\u2019s slow adaptation to market changes and sticking to old business models allowed competitors to gain a foothold. By the 1990s, IBM's PC business was struggling, and in 2005, IBM sold its PC division to Lenovo, leaving the personal computer market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: Many are surprised that they are eligible for a tax reduction on their home, with just a few seconds you can see if you can save in 3 minutes or less.\n\nNvidia could run into similar problems. As more companies start making AI hardware, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs might get cheaper because of the competition. Technology moves fast, so today\u2019s best chips can become outdated quickly. As Nvidia keeps growing, it could face more competition and rules to follow, just like IBM did.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s the $600 billion AI question. As Analyst David Chan from Sequoia writes, there\u2019s a big gap between the money being spent on AI infrastructure and the revenue AI is actually bringing in.\n\nAI companies need to make about $600 billion a year to earn enough to cover these huge investments.\n\nChan said the gap was \"only\" $200 billion in September 2023. Even though Nvidia is making a lot of money, the rest of the AI market isn\u2019t growing fast enough.\n\nKeller\u2019s comparison to IBM is both a compliment and a warning because Nvidia's success now doesn\u2019t guarantee its future. After all, the tech world is full of once market-leading companies that didn\u2019t keep up with changes.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "While the term artificial intelligence (AI) has become something of a buzzword recently, the more accurate term for what most AI companies are aiming to achieve is machine learning. However, due to the cultural popularity of AI thanks to science fiction and Hollywood, the term has eclipsed machine learning as the primary descriptor for the current trend of data analytics and targeted information searches that constitute much of the AI sector. As such, many of the major AI stocks might be better classified as machine learning stocks.\n\nYet, the real value these machine learning stocks hold is in their potential future applications for data analytics, as machine learning models are intended to automate various algorithmic processes. Depending on the potential profit generation from this automation, a machine learning company could see revenues increase as a result of its software service. Investors would be wise to pay attention to these three machine learning stocks.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA long-time industry staple, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is one of the earliest developers of machine learning technology still on the market. Furthermore, one of its newest iterations of the Watson AI models, Watson Studio has the potential to make the company a critical member of the future of AI training and machine learning.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this new platform, IBM aims to empower smaller-scale developers to design and implement their own AIs through machine learning training. This enables data scientists and software engineers to tailor the Watson AI base to their specific needs while providing data and insights to IBM\u2019s development team.\n\nEssentially, this means that IBM enters into a symbiotic relationship with developers where the two work together to improve the efficiency of their respective machine-learning structures. With the introduction of Watson Studio and a robust profit margin so far in 2024, IBM stock continues to look like a great value among machine learning stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a dominant force in the software and cloud computing markets through its Microsoft Azure business section. Now the company is also pioneering the concept of machine learning models as a service to derive even more revenue from its powerful data center business.\n\nThe intended value of the Azure Machine Learning platform stems from Microsoft\u2019s ability to create scalable data analysis and AI training environments for customers of any size and application. Additionally, with the world\u2019s largest software user base, Microsoft\u2019s vast data resources offer a significant edge in AI development, enabling its machine learning services to become that much more effective.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis positions Microsoft to carve out a niche among machine learning stocks by improving the enterprise-level functionality of its customers while using that data to improve its own products. Pair this with Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the tech sector and deep pockets for further research and it\u2019s likely MSFT will continue to be a big player in the world of AI and machine learning development.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nNo discussion of machine learning stocks is complete without considering what Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has to offer. Alphabet has been a consistently quiet member of the machine learning community through its development and maintenance of a software called TensorFlow.\n\nOver eight years since its release and with dual functionality for programming in both Python and C++, TensorFlow is now one of the central tools through which many developers build machine learning applications. Though Alphabet does not earn revenue from its use as it is open source and free, the company owns the architecture on which many machine learning applications are built on.\n\nThis improves Alphabet\u2019s ability to later acquire these developers or cooperate with them on future development cycles. Taking this into consideration alongside a projected $340.61 billion in revenue for 2024, Alphabet stands out as a strong contender among machine learning stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget A.I.

        "content": "More companies and individuals are storing valuable data in the internet. While the internet has allowed people and organizations to become more efficient and access more choices, it also presents risks. Hackers can infiltrate databases and get access to sensitive data.\u00a0This increase in risks present online has provided some tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks and the companies they represent.\n\nCybersecurity firms minimize the risk and allow people to use the internet in a safe and secure manner. These companies shield businesses from cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals use software to detect and address issues before they get serious.\n\nInvestors can profit by finding industries with high demand and plenty of growth prospects. As data continues to proliferate the web, cybersecurity companies should continue to experience impressive growth rates. The cybersecurity market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.7% from now until 2030. Several corporations have positioned themselves to benefit from tailwinds. These are some of the top cybersecurity stocks that long-term investors may want to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been outperforming the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 58% year-to-date (YTD) and have soared by 480% over the past five years. The cybersecurity giant is a recent addition to the S&P 500 and continues to deliver impressive revenue growth.\n\nCrowdstrike reported 33% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q1 2025 and now has $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue. Net income came to $42.8 million compared to $500,000 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company is incorporating artificial intelligence to keep people safe. Charlotte AI makes it easier for cybersecurity professionals and teams to detect issues in real-time and perform mundane tasks in a shorter amount of time. Crowdstrike has a lofty valuation, but profit margin expansion can lead to promising long-term gains.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the company. Crowdstrike is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 31 analysts. The highest price target of $440 per share suggests a 13% upside.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) A man sitting in front of a computer\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a data security firm that helps clients stay on top of their data from one central cloud-based platform. The company has an annual recurring revenue model that recently topped $770 million. That\u2019s up by 16% YOY.\n\nUnlike most cybersecurity stocks, CommVault is a smaller company with a reasonable valuation. It only has a $5.5 billion market cap and a 33 P/E ratio. However, the stock has done its part in beating the market. Shares are up by 61% YTD and have gained 143% over the past five years. Investors who like Crowdstrike as a company, but believe the valuation is overstretched, may want to give CommVault Systems a closer look.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street hasn\u2019t been covering this stock as much, but a recent price target of $140 per share suggests a 13% upside from current levels. CommVault System\u2019s revenue and earnings have been accelerating in recent years. Revenue increased by 10% YOY in Q4 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) operates in numerous verticals, including cybersecurity.

The platform is a part of Microsoft Cloud revenue which hit $35.1 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Cloud revenue increased by 23% YOY while overall revenue was up by 17%.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its cybersecurity market share with Copilot for Security. This AI tool makes it easier for small businesses to monitor their digital defenses and take decisive action against threats. Microsoft has many bulls in Wall Street and is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests a 7% upside.\n\nMicrosoft is the only stock on this list that isn\u2019t a pure cybersecurity play. Investors also get exposure to LinkedIn, Xbox, Bing, Microsoft\u2019s suite of business software and other segments. The well-diversified stock is up by 26% YTD and has gained 241% over the past five years.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, CVLT, and MSFT.

        "content": "As the adoption of metaverse technologies may take take years, investors in undervalued metaverse stocks can bet on long-term growth. An unlimited digital world that can accommodate millions of people is a goldmine, as it represents a new market with solvent modern participants. Since the metaverse industry is only in the early stages of its development, buying shares in related companies promises early investment benefits. The field requires many components for its sustainable operation, which expands the list of areas that will gain from the introduction of metaverses.\n\nVirtual reality technologies will play a crucial role in this process, as users need VR headsets and haptic devices. However, infrastructure development also involves computing power providers, chip manufacturers, Internet providers, software and cybersecurity specialists. By 2030, the industry is projected to grow by more than 30% per year. If you are among the first metaverse investors, you can get a piece of the pie from the business, which could be worth more than $2369.70 billion in 2033.\n\nFidelity Metaverse ETF (FMET) Fidelity Investments sign hangs from a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLaunched on April 19, 2022, the Fidelity Metaverse ETF (NASDAQ: FMET) is one of the youngest exchange-traded funds in the United States. Its main goal is to track the performance of the Fidelity Metaverse Index, which includes many companies in the metaverse sector. The connection can be diverse: from the production and sale of chips for this area to the full-scale development of the meta-space. The fund offers diversification so that enthusiasts are more likely to benefit from the growth of undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn October-November 2022, the asset price did not exceed $20, while now buyers are willing to pay more than $30. The growth is smooth, without sharp jumps and significant plateau zones, anttracting investors with its stability. Over the past 3 months, FMET has added 11.25% to its value and has risen to the current level of $31.94. The inclusion of top-ranked tech stocks in the index, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), has contributed to the current growth, which may continue in the coming months. Experts predict that the stock will reach the $40 mark and have high expectations for the fund\u2019s future.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is a giant of the tech industry, and therefore has enough resources to reconfigure its activities to meet the trends. One of the latest such changes is the reformatting of the 2022-2024 period. The decline in the share price below $100 was the result of concerns about aggressive investment in metaverse initiatives. However, after breaking out of the low point in October 2022, the company began a steady growth that continues to this day. The implementation of AI technology and related advances have propelled Meta to unprecedented heights. With a price per share of $534.69, the company exceeds its 2022 figures by five times, but the potential is still not fully unlocked so META is still among the undervalued metaverse stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on artificial intelligence is paying off in the form of more accurate targeted advertising and, consequently, higher ad prices. The latest earnings report exceeded market expectations and confirmed the correctness of the diversification approach. The bullish sentiment around META continues to grow, as does the wave of excitement over the positive impact of AI, which means we can expect new rounds of the company\u2019s development shortly.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nArchitecture, engineering, entertainment, and construction are all areas that require a reliable software provider, and Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) meets this demand. The company with a market capitalization of $53.08 billion has gained a foothold in the market and become an integral part of many high-tech metaverse projects. After the downturn of April-May 2024, Autodesk began to gain momentum, as reflected in its indicators such as the 50-day moving average (+29.12) and the 200-day moving average (+42.99). The latter indicator shows an increase of 21.07%, which characterizes the bullish momentum of the stock.

        "content": "What do you consider your buy-and-hold stocks? Some investors focus on growth, others lean towards value, and some even bet heavily on trending meme stocks \u2014 but which strategy is optimal?\n\nAs with everything in investing, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all rule for selecting your buy-and-hold stocks. However, for most retail investors with a long-term horizon, certain characteristics should form the backbone of your search. You\u2019ll notice recurring themes if you research these companies deeply enough. Broadly speaking, these potential buy-and-hold stocks combine a proven operational track record with substantial growth, robust financial health, and clear upside potential, making long-term capital appreciation a clear likelihood.\n\nAt the same time, some of these remain speculative plays compared to pure-value investments; this increases the chance of rapid growth and gains while their inherent risk is buffered by the stability of other buy-and-hold stocks, ultimately creating a well-rounded portfolio for the long run.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSay what you will about Elon Musk, but there\u2019s no denying that investors who counted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) among their portfolio\u2019s buy-and-hold stocks had a stellar performance over the years. Just ask the legions of short sellers who bet otherwise and lost billions. Tesla\u2019s next bull run may just be getting started following Musk\u2019s pay package approval, which cements his focus on the firm and is already bearing fruit.\n\nThis shift is already evident just weeks after the decision, with Musk redirecting his AI focus back to Tesla. Tesla\u2019s Texas gigafactory is constructing a massive GPU warehouse to house over 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs, aiming to centralize AI development under Tesla. This follows Tesla\u2019s announcement of a $3 billion to $4 billion investment in AI hardware, signaling Musk and Tesla\u2019s commitment to becoming leaders in AI. Enhanced AI capabilities will significantly contribute to advancing Tesla\u2019s \u201cMarch of 9s,\u201d addressing the final major obstacle to achieving full self-driving car technology.\n\nTesla\u2019s robotaxi event on August 8 may prove the final catalyst catapulting Tesla from the (comparatively) lower price range it\u2019s traded at for the past year \u2014 meaning investors looking to buy and hold stocks like Tesla should act soon.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) may not have the flashiest operational model, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its buy-and-hold stock status \u2014 just the opposite, in fact. Visa\u2019s reliable sales streams, operational model, and willingness to adapt to new trends and markets are just some of the reasons Visa stock returned more than 400% over the past decade, doubling the S&P 500\u2019s performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa owns about 20% of the global cashless payment processing market today, but that doesn\u2019t mean management is content with its current dominance. The opposite is true as Visa is making massive inroads toward new client lists while adopting new technology.\n\nSpecifically, Visa is bringing digital wallets (already popular among consumers) to enterprise and corporate clients to help streamline their spending. Corporate credit is already the largest chunk of global credit utilization, and digital wallet opportunities promise to increase its size further and reward VIsa\u2019s efforts.\n\nMarkel Group (MKL) Markel website homepage MRK stock\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarkel Group (NYSE:MKL), primarily known as an insurance company, might initially seem like an unconventional pick among buy-and-hold stocks given the sector\u2019s typically tight margins, despite benefiting short-term benefits from bond yields due to their substantial cash reserves. However, there is much more to Markel Group than meets the eye.\n\nOften dubbed the \u201cbaby Berkshire Hathaway\u201d (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B), Markel Group, under the leadership of CEO Thomas Gayner, is somewhat modeled after Warren Buffett\u2019s approach at Berkshire. Gayner runs Markel as an insurance company and a large holding company that uses \u201cunderwriting profits to invest in equity, through both publicly traded stocks and ownership stakes in private companies.\u201d\n\nThis strategy paid off handsomely, with Markel achieving a 360% return over the past 20 years, edging out the S&P 500\u2019s 326% gain during the same period.\n\nDespite its seemingly high share price, much of the bearish sentiment around Markel focuses on its core insurance underwriting business, overlooking Gayner\u2019s innovative and successful investment approach. If you consider Gayner\u2019s historical performance and believe in his strategy\u2019s sustainability, Markel could be the biggest opportunity in decades if it goes the way of Berkshire.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of buy-and-hold stocks operating within payment processing, few fintech stocks can beat Block (NYSE:SQ). After a few rough quarters, compounded by wider market unease and a crippling short report that ultimately proved overblown, Block\u2019s most recent earnings report points to renewed strength.\n\nSpecifically, Block\u2019s gross profit improved by more than 20% to hit $2.09 billion, with much of that coming from its Cash App segment, which saw profit climb 25% year-over-year. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of 20% or better profitability growth, while sales also jumped 20%.\n\nMoreover, like Visa, Block is focusing on the future of finance \u2014 with a big emphasis on its crypto exchange and new blockchain ventures. Earlier this year, Block released its physical hardware crypto wallet, BitKey, to help diversify its customer base beyond those comfortable enough to hold coins in Cash App. Perhaps noting increased consumer concerns following the FTX debacle, Block is rapidly positioning itself as an all-weather crypto player to differentiate itself in the long term.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo in a smartphone with a series of stock charts on the background.\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stock finally broke free from its sub-$25 trading range, and many investors are noticing. But, for those paying attention, Palantir always counted itself among the ranks of quality buy-and-hold stocks, even if per-share pricing volatility made short-term trading tough.\n\nPalantir\u2019s biggest strength today is rapid diversification beyond government contracting; government contracts offer decent money and long-term sales, and staking your operational future on just a few clients \u2014 even governmental \u2014 is risky. But Palantir is seeing success compound across its corporate client list, creating a snowball effect as it delivers value to private firms as diverse as Tampa General Hospital, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), AARP, and even Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN).\n\nPalantir\u2019s operational model creates a certain amount of entrenchment and high switching costs; in other words, once a company relies on what Palantir offers, they\u2019re unlikely to move to a competitor. A wider range of corporate clients both diversifies and extends Palantir\u2019s sales streams, compounding Palantir\u2019s status among buy-and-hold stocks.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) A phone displaying the logo for Brookfield Renewable Corporation (BEPC)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock\n\nFew stocks capture as wide a swath of the sustainable and green energy sectors as Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), making it a top buy and hold stock for sustainability-minded investors.\n\nBrookfield Renewable Partners holds a diverse portfolio of smaller renewable energy companies worldwide, focusing on long-term value rather than short-term gains. That trait makes it stand out among even the most forward-thinking buy-and-hold stocks. Brookfield\u2019s portfolio includes hydroelectric power, wind, utility-scale solar, and energy distribution solutions. This diversity helps investors to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies in specific sectors while aligning with the broader sustainability movement.\n\nManagement aims for a 12% to 15% total return by enhancing existing assets and securing market deals, creating a long-term compounding effect for buy-and-hold investors. Since Brookfield Renewable\u2019s parent company often deals with distressed debt investments, the current economic climate means plenty of new opportunities for management to set itself up for long-term momentum.\n\nSmaller firms struggling to raise capital or manage debt may find themselves attractive merger and acquisition targets for Brookfield, a trend we\u2019re already seeing accelerate.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a prime choice for long-term buy-and-hold stocks, combining smart financial management, significant long-term growth potential, and innovative leadership that continues to push boundaries despite its size \u2014 a distinction not as evident in companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategic positioning in the AI sector may be the next catalyst to propel shares higher. While skepticism about more ambitious AI claims is understandable, the technology undeniably challenges traditional search engines and introduces new productivity tools that enhance Microsoft\u2019s existing software suite. Microsoft\u2019s hefty investment in OpenAI, the leading AI firm, secures it a front-row seat and early entrant advantage in developing the next major technological breakthrough.\n\nToday is reminiscent of the early 2000s when search engine technology was on the horizon, but consumers didn\u2019t realize its enormous potential and profitability. Among public companies, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this future potential, making it a top buy-and-hold stock for a forward-thinking investment strategy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in MKL.

He predicts this trend will be driven by the increasing accessibility of artificial intelligence (AI) through consumer electronics.\n\nEisman, known for his successful \"Big Short\" bet against subprime mortgages before the global financial crisis, suggests that consumers' desire for new AI applications on smartphones and personal computers will trigger the \"biggest refresh cycle in history.\" This wave of upgraded device purchases will likely benefit tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro!

He points out that the company's earnings have tripled, making it a sound investment. Eisman has previously disclosed that he owns a substantial amount of Nvidia shares.\n\nEisman also shared his views on the broader economy, stating that although it's slowing down, the situation is stable. He sees no fundamental reason to short stocks significantly.\n\nReflecting on his past experiences, Eisman said, \"I predicted the end of the world once \u2014 it was pretty awful for everybody. I have no interest in predicting it again and there's no data to show that it's going to happen.\"\n\nRegarding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Eisman believes there are times to short the company when fundamentals are deteriorating. However, he concedes that this becomes challenging when investors focus on Tesla's self-driving car and AI ambitions rather than its fundamentals. Eisman clarified that while he doesn't short for his clients, he occasionally does so on a personal basis.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSteve Eisman: Big tech dominance to continue, predicts Trump victory\n\nExclusive-Anson Funds pushing Five9 to explore a sale, sources say\n\nStock Market Today: Nasdaq tumbles despite soft CPI data, Nvidia falls 5.6%\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Key Republican lawmakers asked the Biden administration to prepare a formal intelligence community assessment of a budding partnership between Microsoft Corp. and Abu Dhabi AI firm G42, with a focus on the Emirati company\u2019s ties to China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Modi\u2019s Embrace of Putin Irks Biden Team Pushing Support for Kyiv Archegos\u2019 Bill Hwang Convicted of Fraud, Market Manipulation Biden Aides to Meet Senators After Pelosi Remarks Deal Blow NATO Singles Out China Over Its Support for Russia in Ukraine\n\nRepresentatives Michael McCaul and John Moolenaar, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Select Committee on China, respectively, detailed their concerns about the deal in a Wednesday letter to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.\n\n\u201cWe support your efforts to work hand in glove with U.S. companies like Microsoft to strengthen our dominance in AI; however, we must also be cleareyed about the risks posed by transferring our most critical AI technology particularly when it comes to countries where the PRC is active,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nMicrosoft announced in April that it would invest $1.5 billion in G42. Under the agreement, Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the UAE firm\u2019s board and G42 will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud for its AI applications. The deal was supported by the Biden administration, which is determined to bolster US AI leadership around the world \u2014 and see G42 decouple from Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nBut the arrangement quickly attracted scrutiny in Washington, where some officials had already grown wary of G42 over its alleged ties to blacklisted Chinese companies. The concerns range from the possibility of China accessing sensitive American technology to the risks of shipping AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\n\nOne key question is whether the US will approve shipments of cutting-edge Nvidia Corp. H100 chips for data centers in the Middle East. Officials have been slow-walking those licenses over the past several months, Bloomberg has reported, as they hash out an AI national security strategy for the Gulf.\n\nMcCaul and Moolenaar said in their letter that they\u2019ve had \u201cnumerous productive conversations\u201d with Microsoft about their worries. But they want to see \u201csignificantly more robust\u201d national security guardrails before the US transfers any sensitive technology \u2014 including hardware, services and research. They also called for a more formal framework around the export of chips and AI model weights.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to the risks of hardware shipments, some Pentagon officials are also skeptical that G42 will fully decouple from China, a key promise that paved the way for the Microsoft partnership. A new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle called Lunate is taking over management of what was G42\u2019s 42XFund, an entity with stakes in units of Chinese tech giants such as ByteDance Ltd. Lunate, like G42, is part of a business empire overseen by United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\n--With assistance from Dina Bass.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Ukraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs At SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving How Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla How Digital Money Really Works\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Two 80-something journalists tried ChatGPT. Then, they sued to protect the 'written word'",
        "content": "GRAFTON, Mass. (AP) \u2014 When two octogenarian buddies named Nick discovered that ChatGPT might be stealing and repurposing a lifetime of their work, they tapped a son-in-law to sue the companies behind the artificial intelligence chatbot.\n\nVeteran journalists Nicholas Gage, 84, and Nicholas Basbanes, 81, who live near each other in the same Massachusetts town, each devoted decades to reporting, writing and book authorship.\n\nGage poured his tragic family story and search for the truth about his mother's death into a bestselling memoir that led John Malkovich to play him in the 1985 film \u201cEleni.\u201d Basbanes transitioned his skills as a daily newspaper reporter into writing widely-read books about literary culture.\n\nBasbanes was the first of the duo to try fiddling with AI chatbots, finding them impressive but prone to falsehoods and lack of attribution. The friends commiserated and filed their lawsuit earlier this year, seeking to represent a class of writers whose copyrighted work they allege \u201chas been systematically pilfered by\u201d OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft.\n\n\u201cIt's highway robbery,\u201d Gage said in an interview in his office next to the 18th-century farmhouse where he lives in central Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d added Basbanes, as the two men perused Gage's book-filled shelves. \u201cWe worked too hard on these tomes.\u201d\n\nNow their lawsuit is subsumed into a broader case seeking class-action status led by household names like John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d novelist George R. R. Martin; and proceeding under the same New York federal judge who\u2019s hearing similar copyright claims from media outlets such as The New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Mother Jones.\n\nWhat links all the cases is the claim that OpenAI \u2014 with help from Microsoft's money and computing power \u2014 ingested huge troves of human writings to \u201ctrain\u201d AI chatbots to produce human-like passages of text, without getting permission or compensating the people who wrote the original works.\n\n\u201cIf they can get it for nothing, why pay for it?\u201d Gage said. \u201cBut it\u2019s grossly unfair and very harmful to the written word.\u201d\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft didn\u2019t return requests for comment this week but have been fighting the allegations in court and in public. So have other AI companies confronting legal challenges not just from writers but visual artists, music labels and other creators who allege that generative AI profits have been built on misappropriation.\n\nThe chief executive of Microsoft\u2019s AI division, Mustafa Suleyman, defended AI industry practices at last month\u2019s Aspen Ideas Festival, voicing the theory that training AI systems on content that\u2019s already on the open internet is protected by the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine of U.S. copyright laws.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe social contract of that content since the \u201990s has been that it is fair use,\u201d Suleyman said. \u201cAnyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has been freeware, if you like.\u201d\n\nSuleyman said it was more of a \u201cgray area\u201d in situations where some news organizations and others explicitly said they didn\u2019t want tech companies \u201cscraping\u201d content off their websites. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to work its way through the courts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cases are still in the discovery stage and scheduled to drag into 2025. In the meantime, some who believe their professions are threatened by AI business practices have tried to secure private deals to get technology companies to pay a fee to license their archives. Others are fighting back.\n\n\u201cSomebody had to go out and interview real people in the real world and conduct real research by poring over documents and then synthesizing those documents and coming up with a way to render them in clear and simple prose,\u201d said Frank Pine, executive editor of MediaNews Group, publisher of dozens of newspapers including the Denver Post, Orange County Register and St. Paul Pioneer Press. The newspaper chain sued OpenAI in April.\n\n\u201cAll of that is real work, and it\u2019s work that AI cannot do,\" Pine said. \"An AI app is never going to leave the office and go downtown where there\u2019s a fire and cover that fire.\u201d\n\nDeemed too similar to lawsuits filed late last year, the Massachusetts duo's January complaint has been folded into a consolidated case brought by other nonfiction writers as well as fiction writers represented by the Authors Guild. That means Gage and Basbanes won't likely be witnesses in any upcoming trial in Manhattan's federal court. But in the twilight of their careers, they thought it important to take a stand for the future of their craft.\n\nGage fled Greece as a 9-year-old, haunted by his mother's 1948 killing by firing squad during the country's civil war. He joined his father in Worcester, Massachusetts, not far from where he lives today. And with a teacher's nudge, he pursued writing and built a reputation as a determined investigative reporter digging into organized crime and political corruption for The New York Times and other newspapers.\n\nBasbanes, as a Greek American journalist, had heard of and admired the elder \u201chotshot reporter\u201d when he got a surprise telephone call at his desk at Worcester's Evening Gazette in the early 1970s. The voice asked for Mr. Basbanes, using the Greek way of pronouncing the name.\n\n\u201cYou were like a talent scout,\u201d Basbanes said. \u201cWe established a friendship. I mean, I\u2019ve known him longer than I know my wife, and we\u2019ve been married 49 years.\u201d\n\nBasbanes hasn\u2019t mined his own story like Gage has, but he says it can sometimes take days to craft a great paragraph and confirm all of the facts in it. It took him years of research and travel to archives and auction houses to write his 1995 book \u201cA Gentle Madness\u201d about the art of book collection from ancient Egypt through modern times.\n\n\u201cI love that \u2018A Gentle Madness\u2019 is in 1,400 libraries or so,\u201d Basbanes said. \u201cThis is what a writer strives for -- to be read. But you also write to earn, to put food on the table, to support your family, to make a living. And as long as that\u2019s your intellectual property, you deserve to be compensated fairly for your efforts.\u201d\n\nGage took a great professional risk when he quit his job at the Times and went into $160,000 debt to find out who was responsible for his mother's death.\n\n\u201cI tracked down everyone who was in the village when my mother was killed,\" he said. \u201cAnd they had been scattered all over Eastern Europe. So it cost a lot of money and a lot of time. I had no assurance that I would get that money back. But when you commit yourself to something as important as my mother\u2019s story was, the risks are tremendous, the effort is tremendous.\u201d\n\nIn other words, ChatGPT couldn't do that. But what worries Gage is that ChatGPT could make it harder for others to do that.\n\n\u201cPublications are going to die. Newspapers are going to die. Young people with talent are not going to go into writing,\u201d Gage said. \u201cI'm 84 years old. I don\u2019t know if this is going to be settled while I\u2019m still around. But it\u2019s important that a solution be found.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article looks at the most advanced country in Asia in 2024. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024.\n\nA report by McKinsey in 2020 highlighted the progress made by Asia in technology and innovation over the past decade, accounting for 52% of the global growth in technology companies' revenues. The continent\u2019s share of the new unicorns established between 2012 and 2020 stood at 36%, an improvement from the decade prior when the contribution was measured at 29%.\n\nMoreover, Asia also represented 51% of the global growth in R&D expenditure during the period, led the world when it came to growth in the number of patents, and also contributed significantly toward the increase in science and engineering research articles published. Between 2016 and 2018, three-fourths of the world\u2019s STEM education graduates came from India, while in 2020, Asia went past Europe in combating climate change, emerging as the global leader in renewable technology with an installation capacity of 45%.\n\nThe advancements in technology and innovation have fueled economic growth in the region, where technology has widely been deployed across sectors, driving enhanced productivity in the corporate sphere, and boosting economic development and public service delivery at a macro level. Many Western observers have already dubbed the 21st century Asia\u2019s century, and the continent now seems to be catching up to the expectations faster than anticipated.\n\nAsia, which accounted for less than one-third of the global economy in purchasing power parity terms in 2000 is now on track to represent more than half of the world\u2019s GDP by 2040, as per a report by McKinsey. The continent is also expected to represent more than 40% of the global consumption by then. Furthermore, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, China and India are set to go past the United States as the world's first and second largest economies by 2050, with the Chinese alone forecasted to make up 20% of the global economy over the next three decades.\n\nSeveral large Western corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have made inroads in the continent by outsourcing some of their key operations to Asia to tap into the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge markets, coupled with making the most of the cheap, skillful labor that is available in abundance in the region. About 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks are manufactured in China, today. The country, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, was the source of 19% of the tech giant\u2019s revenue during the fiscal year 2023. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently further expanded its presence in Asia through its new stores opening in India and Malaysia.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u2019s investments in the continent have seen an uptick in Asia, with the company, in 2021, announcing the establishment of a new data center in Indonesia. The new setup is likely to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. On the other hand, the International Data Corporation (IDC) expects Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to add 100,000 new jobs and $39 billion to the United Arab Emirates\u2019 economy through its cloud-based services between 2022 and 2026.\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute a whopping $19 trillion to the global economy every year. The continent is home to many of the largest corporations in the world, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA).\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a dominant player in the global foundry industry, accounting for 60% of all output. It is currently the third-best hardware stock to buy now, with 135 hedge funds bullish about the company, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database as of the first quarter of 2024. During May, the company\u2019s revenue grew 30% to a total of $7.1 billion, driven by ASML\u2019s announcement to ship its advanced high NA EUV scanner to TSM. The machine is crucial to future manufacturing technologies. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) has a forward P/E ratio of 26 at par with the industry average.\n\nJapanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) has a share of 11.5% of the world\u2019s automobile industry. The company sold a record 11.2 million cars worldwide in 2023, which helped Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) to retain its status as the world\u2019s top car maker for a fourth successive year. On the other hand, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) continues to remain a major force in the e-commerce market, controlling more than 50% of China\u2019s online retail industry. The Most Advanced Country in Asia in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have ranked the most advanced countries in Asia in 2024 based on three weighted metrics: technological advancement, R&D expenditure as a share of the GDP (during the latest year for which data is available), and their level of human development. The weights, in order, were 40%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. Data was sourced from WIPO\u2019s 2023 Global Innovation Index (GII), the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt was observed where each country ranked on a particular metric and accordingly, it was assigned a weighted score. We then summed the weighted scores for each metric to get an overall score. The 15 Most Advanced Countries in Asia in 2024 are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

        "title": "The PC industry is finally on the path to recovery",
        "content": "The turnaround in the global PC market continues to gain speed as hype around AI PCs grows and enterprise customers start to pick up purchases of laptops and desktops. According to early data from market research firm IDC, the PC market grew 3%, marking the second quarter of growth after a staggering seven consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nWhile that\u2019s higher than the 1.9% growth rival firm Gartner says the market saw in the quarter, both numbers point to a recovery in a sector that was crushed after it saw sales pulled forward at the start of the pandemic, which suppressed sales in subsequent quarters.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the PC market, just like other technology markets, faces challenges in the near term due to maturity and headwinds,\" said IDC group vice president Ryan Reith.\n\n\"However, two consecutive quarters of growth, combined with plenty of market hype around AI PCs and a less sexy but arguably more important commercial refresh cycle, seems to be what the PC market needed. The buzz is clearly around AI, but a lot is happening with non-AI PC purchasing to make this mature market show signs of positivity.\"\n\nIn Q1 2023, Gartner reported that PC shipments collapsed a stunning 30% year over year, before beginning to tick back up in Q2 2023 when the firm reported PC shipments fell 16%. A closer look at the Windows Copilot key. (Image: Microsoft) (Microsoft)\n\nThe declines were a rapid turnaround from the explosive growth the PC industry saw in the early days of the pandemic. Consumers and enterprise customers stuck on their couches for months purchased new systems to work from home and for entertainment. But with so many people buying PCs at once, there were fewer customers in need of new machines in subsequent months, sending sales into a nose dive.\n\nSince then, sales have continued to improve, as consumers have begun to replace the laptops and desktops they purchased in the early months of 2020.\n\nPC market declines hit everything from software vendors like Microsoft (MSFT), which reported Windows OEM sales, or sales of its Windows operating system to laptop and desktop manufacturers, fell 39% in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter of 2023.\n\nIntel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) saw similar declines, with Intel reporting that its first quarter Client Computing Group revenue, the organization responsible for PC chip sales, dropped an incredible 38% compared to Q1 2022. AMD reported a 65% year-over-year drop in net revenue in its Client group in 2023 from $2.1 billion to $739 million.\n\nThe market turnaround comes as the PC industry looks to the AI PC as the next leg of growth for laptop and desktop manufacturers. AI PCs are roughly defined as PCs that come equipped with specialized neural processing units.\n\nStory continues AMD launched its first AI PC desktop chip at CES 2024. (Image: AMD) (AMD)\n\nMicrosoft is marketing AI PCs that include its Copilot technology as Copilot+PCs. It\u2019s a bit of a mouthful, and the company\u2019s launch hasn\u2019t exactly gone as it hoped. Initially, Microsoft was expecting to kick off its Copilot+PC push with a software feature called Recall designed to screenshot virtually everything you do on your computer, making it easier to pick up where you left off and keep you from losing your place while searching the web. But security researchers raised concerns about the app, and Microsoft was forced to pull back on the feature to address any potential issues.\n\nIntel, AMD, and Nvidia are also getting in on the AI PC push, with Intel and AMD launching AI PC chips, and Nvidia noting that PCs running its dedicated graphics chips can easily handle AI PC apps.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) is also making a run at the AI PC market, launching its latest PC chip in Microsoft Copilot+PCs including that company\u2019s Surface Laptop and Surface Pro. The chipmaker promises the kind of performance that Apple has managed to squeeze out of its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops, including all-day battery life and exceptional processing power.\n\nThe AI PC market is still new \u2014 Microsoft only launched its Copilot+PCs in May \u2014 and there\u2019s still no sense as to how many users will specifically opt for AI PCs for their capabilities versus how many will them because they\u2019re simply the latest and greatest on the market. Still, the industry is clearly on an upward trajectory, and for PC makers, that\u2019s what matters most. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has successfully navigated away from a potentially lengthy European Union (EU) antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices. The tech giant reached an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon AMZN-backed trade association that had previously raised concerns about Microsoft's software licensing agreements.\r\n\r\nThe deal will result in CISPE withdrawing its complaint to the EU's competition department. CISPE had alleged that Microsoft was making it challenging for customers to switch cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services. This practice, according to the lobby group, was hindering fair competition in the European cloud market.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has not only addressed past concerns but also collaborated with CISPE to create a framework for increased competition in the cloud computing sector across Europe and beyond. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe agreement allows CISPE members to access enhanced Microsoft Azure features and permits service providers to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures.\r\n\r\nThis latest development demonstrates Microsoft's efforts to navigate the complex regulatory landscape in Europe, reminiscent of its past battles with EU regulators over Windows' market dominance.\n\nYear-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicrosoft's Legal Challenges Mirror Growing Scrutiny of Big Tech\n\nThe agreement marks the end of a protracted dispute between Microsoft and CISPE, during which MSFT made several concessions to address the concerns of cloud service providers. This development comes at a time when EU regulators had been informally probing market competitors and customers about Microsoft's business practices.\r\n\r\nDespite this resolution, Microsoft continues to face scrutiny on other fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is currently under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. Microsoft has given up its board observer seat at OpenAI in a move aimed at easing U.S. and U.K. antitrust regulators' concerns about the extent of its control over the AI startup amid the soaring popularity of generative AI.\r\n\r\nLast week, the company agreed to a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over allegations of discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. (Read More: Microsoft Settles Discrimination Lawsuit in California)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in June, the EU accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its other business software. (Read More: Microsoft Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office)\r\n\r\nAs the tech industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how this agreement will shape the competitive dynamics of the European cloud market and whether it will fully address the concerns raised by other major players in the industry.\r\n\r\nWhile the European Commission has stated it will evaluate the settlement's impact on competition in European cloud markets, the deal has not been extended to some major players in the industry. CISPE confirmed that Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba BABA cloud service were not included in the agreement. This exclusion has drawn criticism from these companies, with AWS asserting that the settlement fails to address the needs of the majority of Microsoft customers, who still face restrictions in choosing their preferred cloud provider.\r\n\r\nShares of MSFT have gained 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 29.4%, 31.5% and 36.9%, respectively.\r\n\r\nAs tech giants expand and innovate, they encounter mounting pressure to uphold fair competition, safeguard user rights and foster equitable workplaces. The resolutions of ongoing legal challenges could establish crucial precedents, potentially transforming how these companies function and engage with their workforce, clientele and rivals in the evolving tech landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Hot Analyst Upgrades That Are Moving Stocks This Summer",
        "content": "The S&P 500 has continued to receive bullish forecasts from market analysts, including recent analyst upgrades. Some suggest the index could reach a target of 6,100 by the end of the year. The optimism is grounded in the index\u2019s foundation of earnings growth, with additional support from favorable inflation news and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nThis \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario has reinforced the \u201cnew normal\u201d for three years, indicating that inflation is cooling. Analysts project that this environment will support the S&P 500\u2019s return to earnings growth, which is anticipated to accelerate in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAnalysts are raising their earnings estimates for the S&P 500, contributing to the index\u2019s upward trajectory. The technology sector, particularly companies classified within the \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d continues to lead the market, buoyed by their involvement in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWedbush analysts forecast a further 15% rise in the S&P 500, driven by the expanding applications of AI and a resultant broadening of the market for tech leaders. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), recognized as enterprise AI industry frontrunners, along with Apple, are expected to capitalize on AI for revenue growth and margin expansion.\n\nKey reports from Microsoft and other prominent tech companies are scheduled for mid-to-late July, while NVIDIA and semiconductor stocks will follow in August. These reports could propel the index to new highs and sustain a rally through the summer and beyond the technical target of 6,100, with Wedbush\u2019s more optimistic target around 6,250.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal\u2019s (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock rating was raised from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cPositive\u201d at Susquehanna following analyst upgrades. The upgrade reflects PayPal\u2019s strategic focus on profitable growth, as outlined in its recent Annual Incentive Plan update for 2024.\n\nPayPal is focusing on growing transaction margin dollars, a central part of its strategy. Susquehanna has highlighted several key initiatives. These include adopting better pricing discipline at Braintree, a PayPal service.\n\nThe company also plans to offer improved merchant services. This provides security, foreign exchange, and advertising through \u201cPayPal Advanced Offers.\u201d For consumers, PayPal aims to boost brand relevance. It will introduce stacked rewards with \u201cPayPal CashPass\u201d and smart receipts.\n\nPayPal wants to grow its cross-border business with small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) through the PayPal Commerce Platform (PPCP). A new feature, \u201cFastlane,\u201d aims to increase PayPal\u2019s market share during the holiday season. Susquehanna\u2019s analysis suggests that PayPal will perform better than expected. This includes TMDs and adjusted EBIT dollars in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nRosenblatt lifted its rating on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares from \u201cNeutral\u201d to \u201cBuy,\u201d accompanied by a significant increase in the price target to $260 from the previous $196, marking one of the notable analyst upgrades this period. This optimism stems from Apple\u2019s strong long-term performance, surpassing the S&P 500 with a 60.79% increase over three years and a remarkable 340.19% gain over five years.\n\nA recent survey in the United States highlights privacy in AI as a crucial demand among consumers. Analysts point out that Apple\u2019s AI focuses on privacy more than Android. They believe this difference could boost Apple\u2019s market share.\n\nBrokers stand to gain from investments in larger cloud service providers. However, they face different cost pressures than these providers. Rosenblatt has increased its price target for Apple\u2019s stock by $64, which shows that the firm expects Apple\u2019s stock performance to improve.\n\nMoreover, analysts have noted Apple\u2019s strategy to incorporate privacy into its AI services. This strategy gives Apple a competitive advantage. It could lead to financial benefits for the company. This upgrade comes at a time when consumers prioritize AI and privacy in their technology choices.\n\nSAP (SAP) SAP sign is seen at SAP SuccessFactors Global Headquarters in South San Francisco, California\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBMO Capital Markets adjusted its stance on SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), elevating the stock from \u201cMarket Perform\u201d to \u201cOutperform\u201d and increasing the price target to $237 from the previous $218. This change, part of recent analyst upgrades, reflects a more optimistic outlook on the software giant\u2019s future performance.\n\nThe firm has updated its rating based on confidence in SAP\u2019s future bookings and revenues. This confidence comes from SAP\u2019s success in moving its large, steady customer base to the cloud.\n\nIn addition, BMO Capital\u2019s analysts stress that SAP\u2019s current cloud backlog and Cloud ERP growth are crucial for success. They have also raised the price target to $237. This change shows their expectation for SAP\u2019s ongoing financial growth.\n\nThe analysts highlight that SAP is on track to hit significant financial goals. Specifically, they aim for \u20ac8 billion in free cash flow by fiscal year 2025. The positive view of SAP also connects to its strategic moves in the cloud sector. These moves should boost the stock\u2019s performance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be the Top Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to End 2024",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of companies that led the market since 2023:\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nOther than Tesla, which is basically flat year to date, this group is having a fairly strong 2024. MSFT data by YCharts.\n\nNvidia outshines them all, continuing its unbelievable run after a phenomenal 2023. But investors who didn't buy in earlier can't do anything about that now; they can only look forward. So which Magnificent Seven stock looks likeliest to be the biggest winner for the rest of the year?\n\nMany of the Magnificent Seven trade at sky-high valuations\n\nLet's start with the stocks that likely won't have the best performances in the second half. While Tesla shares underperformed for most of the year, there were good reasons for that. Demand for its electric vehicles declined and its margins have shrunk due to its price cuts. There are no signs those trends will turn around before 2024 is over.\n\nNext, let's consider valuations: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all trade at expensive levels of 34 times forward earnings or more, which is quite a premium over the benchmark S&P 500 index, which currently averages 22.7 times forward earnings. Those premiums will likely inhibit their performance from here.\n\nThat leaves just Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Of the two, I think Alphabet is primed for the best second half of 2024.\n\nAlphabet's investments are starting to pay off\n\nAlphabet has long been a force in artificial intelligence (AI). However, it appeared caught off guard when the generative AI craze took off in late 2022. As a result, it had to scramble to launch competing products that weren't great initially. However, it has largely cleaned up their problems.\n\nNow, Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, is recognized as one of the top options available, and has already been integrated into several of its products to perform tasks such as summarizing Google search results.\n\nFurthermore, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum. Because most companies can't afford to spend millions of dollars to build and operate their own supercomputers to train AI models, renting that processing power from a cloud computing provider is far more economical. Each cloud infrastructure provider has its specialties, and AI appears to be one of Google Cloud's. With 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion) using its services, it has a strong foothold in this emerging market.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Alphabet's advertising business should continue to perform well this year -- and while AI may be flashy, advertising is what keeps the company's lights on. In Q1, more than three-fourths of its revenue came from advertising-related sources, and that revenue was up 13% year over year. While that's not blazing-fast growth, it is impressive for a fairly mature business. With upcoming catalysts like election-related advertising, we can expect a strong end to 2024 for Alphabet.\n\nAs for its valuation, Alphabet is actually the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven cohort, trading at 25 times forward earnings. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile that's not cheap relative to the broader market, it is when compared to its peers.\n\nBased on the combination of its relatively cheap valuation and its strong business momentum, I have confidence that Alphabet will have a strong close to 2024. Whether it will outperform the rest of the Magnificent Seven is still up in the air -- especially with a wild card like Nvidia in the mix -- but I'm confident that Alphabet will beat the market in the second half.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Exclusive: Armada lands $40 million in funding round led by Microsoft\u2019s M12",
        "content": "When most people talk about hurricanes, they talk about the storm itself\u2014the dark, swirling experience of watching trees fall from the right side of a glass hurricane window.\n\nBut I\u2019m from Florida and I\u2019m here to tell you: The hurricane doesn\u2019t end when the storm ends\u2014it ends when the power and gas comes back on. When I was a kid, latency was part of that process. My siblings and I would play Candy Land in the sweaty Miami dark, while utilities providers and companies scrambled to figure out who needed help.\n\nWhat do my childhood Candy Land games have to do with startups and venture capital? Well, power outages are still a problem (perhaps more so as warming oceans fuel more hurricanes), and solutions to problems are what the startup game is all about.\n\nDan Wright, the cofounder and CEO of Armada, believes that extreme situations like hurricanes reinforce the need for \u201cedge\u201d computing, the practice of processing data locally rather than sending it back to the cloud. \u201cLots of oil and gas companies are really very concerned about these types of disasters,\u201d Wright says. \u201cYou can't have any latency. You have to be able to respond in real time.\"\n\nDisaster response is the obvious application, but Wright and the Armada crew believe edge technology also has a big role to play in all sorts of remote environments where uninterrupted data access is critical. Think real-time safety monitoring at high-risk worksites, real-time emissions tracking for oil rigs, and automated operations for mines. The company collaborates with Starlink and has recently launched partnerships with companies like Halliburton and Skydio.\n\nArmada came out of stealth in 2023 and has so far raised $100 million, having just announced its Series A in December. And now, Fortune can exclusively report, it has scored another $40 million from Microsoft\u2019s venture fund, M12. Along with the funding, Armada\u2019s products will become available in Microsoft Azure\u2019s marketplace.\n\nIt\u2019s a natural fit, says Pradeep Nair, Armada\u2019s founding CTO and a 10-year veteran of Microsoft\u2019s Azure business. \u201cIf you look at all of these customers we\u2019re hitting\u2014oil, gas, and mining\u2014these guys are legacy, traditional customers and Microsoft is their biggest vendor,\u201d he says. The partnership with Microsoft \u201copens up the whole pipeline, without us needing to go through the whole procurement process.\u201d\n\nThe company declined to disclose any metrics or the number of current customers. A source familiar with the matter said that the company\u2019s valuation jumped with this extension. Still, it\u2019s a rare thing right now to see investors dazzled by a young company that\u2019s not expressly an AI startup. Sure, Armada\u2019s deploying AI, but it\u2019s not the point. So, what\u2019s resonating?\n\nStory continues\n\n\"People are thinking a lot about edge [computing] because even in highly populated environments, there's this recognition of the difficulties around power,\u201d says Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. \u201cPeople are really and increasingly concerned about how we get enough power to the edge. How do we use the data that we\u2019re pulling off the edge?\u201d\n\nFounders Fund, which has been involved with Armada since the very beginning, is among a group of existing Armada investors that includes Lux Capital, Felicis, Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Shield Capital. The startup\u2019s mission, Stephens said, began with the relatively vague idea around disconnected compute.\n\n\"I feel like every good business has kind of a funny narrative for all of the ideas that it bubbles up at the beginning,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cThen, you're popping all of the bubbles, getting down to the thing that has real product-market fit.\"\n\n\u201cThere are 100 potential use cases,\u201d added Stephens.\n\nMany of these use cases seem to be oriented around high-stakes environments, where a well-timed safety alert can make the difference between life and death. (That\u2019s especially the case, say, on a fire-prone offshore oil rig.)\n\nIs that the deliberate focus?\n\n\u201cThe problems that matter the most can only be solved if you bridge the digital divide and bring connectivity, compute, and AI to the data\u2014wherever it is,\u201d Wright says.\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nAllie Garfinkle\r\nTwitter:@agarfinks\r\nEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\r\nSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\n\nJoe Abrams curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, an investment management company, released its \u201cValue Equity Strategy\u201d second quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. US markets continued their trend in the second quarter and the S&P 500 Index rose 4.28%. \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d drove the rally once again. The composite returned -1.55% gross of fees (\u20101.61% net of fees) in the second quarter outperforming the \u20102.17% return of the Russell 1000 Value Index and trailing the 4.28% return of the S&P 500 Index. Security selection led the composite to outperform in the quarter relative to the Russell 1000 Value Index, while allocation effects detracted. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), in the second quarter 2024 investor letter. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 5.59%, and its shares gained 36.07% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On July 10, 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $466.25 per share with a market capitalization of $3.465 trillion.\n\nAristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a leading technology company specializing in software, hardware, cloud services, AI and digital applications, was one of the largest contributors during the quarter. The company continues to execute on a myriad of catalysts across its businesses, particularly within cloud\u2010based applications like Azure and platform\u2010based servicessuch as LinkedIn. For Azure, Microsoft detailed previously announced partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD to develop first\u2010party silicon chips and custom\u2010 designed infrastructure innovations, including its AI accelerator (Azure Maia) and CPU (Azure Cobalt). These advancements are part of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to enhance AI performance and efficiency within the Azure ecosystem. LinkedIn, which has more than doubled its membership to over one billion in the past four years, is expanding its revenue streams across subscriptions and advertising and increasingly disrupting traditional recruiting and training functions. LinkedIn recently passed $16 billion in run rate annual revenue, which is only ~7% of total Microsoft revenue, but if it were a standalone business, it would be in the top half of S&P 500 constituents! The Azure and LinkedIn examples are just two of many that illustrate Microsoft\u2019s ongoing transformation from an operating system to a total technology solutions provider.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is in second position on our list of\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 293 hedge fund portfolios held Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the end of the first quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. It was a record quarter for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), driven by continued strength in the Microsoft Cloud. The company reported $61.9 billion in revenues, up 17% year over year. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Dump Before the AI Bubble Bursts",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is up more than 50% from 2022 lows. The primary reason for the resilience of the stock market is enthusiasm around AI stocks. Excitement\u00a0surrounding artificial intelligence and its potential as a revolutionary technology have sent AI shares skyward, creating what many believe is a bubble reminiscent of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. That has many wondering whether it\u2019s time to sell.\n\nValuations and investor exuberance are still not as high as they were during the dotcom crash. Yet, investors continue to wonder whether the similarities are too great to ignore. The inflation of each respective bubble was prompted by the introduction of world changing technology. Investors, eager to secure early gains, have rushed to get their piece of the pie. It\u2019s a recipe for trouble if expectations do not meet reality.\n\nThe good news is that important metrics including the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratios are currently much lower than they were at the dotcom peak. The bad news is that all bubbles are different and unforeseen factors may be at play now that no one can predict until it\u2019s too late.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green trees\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is the most obvious choice among AI stocks to sell before any potential bubble bursts. One of the most obvious reasons to believe that is in the similarity between Nvidia and dotcom champion Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).\n\nCisco shares surged by roughly 4,500% in the 5-year period prior to its peak in 2000. Nvidia\u2019s Shares are up roughly 4,300% over the past 5 years. Whether it\u2019s a coincidence or not, time will tell.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors continue to bet so bullishly on Nvidia following its most recent earnings report from late May. Revenue surged by more than 250% on a year-over-year basis. Sales reached $26 billion, $22.6 billion of which came from data center sales. It all continues to suggest that Nvidia is one of the best investments in AI which is largely seen as a commodity akin to gold for the digital age.\n\nYet, questions remain about Nvidia and how truly the company is capturing the current opportunity. The truth is that over the past five years Nvidia\u2019s asset growth has outpaced its revenue growth substantially. That\u2019s a real sign that Nvidia\u2019s big bet on AI has not yet produced as substantial results as some may believe. If you need a reason to sell, take that as your signal.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cursory glance at the stock chart of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shows that there are real concerns about a current AI bubble.\n\nStory continues\n\nShare prices surged above $1,800 by mid June and promptly retreated back below $1,600 one week later. That jump and subsequent decline was seen across most of the AI sector and was a representation of broadly held questions by AI investors. Share prices have rebounded since but the volatility is a clear indication that investors recognize Broadcom may be in the midst of an AI fueled bubble.\n\nBroadcom isn\u2019t a pure play AI stock but the company did mention \u2018AI\u2019 51 times in its most recent earnings call. So AVGO may well be the beneficiary of a halo effect surrounding all things AI.\n\nThere are indications that Broadcom internally feels that its share price can\u2019t grow much further. The company has chosen to implement a 10-for-one forward stock split. Such a stock split does nothing to change the fundamentals of the underlying company and primarily serves to increase prices due to psychological effects. Management\u2019s decision to implement the forward split should serve as a clue to investors to sell.\n\nFundamentals based screening tools suggest Broadcom is significantly overvalued at present. It\u2019s clearly benefiting from the AI halo effect and is at risk as such.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has come back to life following the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC24). AI is partially responsible for the resurgence in share prices at Apple indicating it is highly exposed to AI bubble hype.\n\nApple introduced two things at the briefly held conference on June 10. Those big upgrades include iOS 18 and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. The company\u2019s massive user base is now poised to receive years of upgrades. That promises to send share prices higher. However, a question arises: how much of that recent surge in share prices is simply AI hype?\n\nIt is of course a question that no one can answer currently. Nevertheless, investors remain somewhat cautious. Apple\u2019s revenues are still not as strong as they were a year ago. So, while the introduction of iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence is promising, the company is still facing an uphill battle.\n\nApple continues to produce substantial cash flows that allow it to satisfy shareholders but if its generative AI efforts prove fruitless it won\u2019t be able to substantiate share prices at this level moving forward.\n\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) might not look the way investors expect it to.\n\nIf AMD\u2019s AI bubble bursts it will really be about investor perception of the company\u2019s inability to capture a greater percentage of sales from Nvidia. The point here is that some analysts see indications of that sort of weak competitiveness indicated at price levels between $116 and $132.\n\nThose price levels may be much higher than many would expect following a bubble burst. Yet, that\u2019s exactly where technical analysts see AMD falling to if it continues to be ineffective in clawing away market share from Nvidia.\n\nAMD Shares are up roughly 14% year-to-date. Those same shares rose from $140 at New Year\u2019s to more than $210 by early March. They now trade for $160. AMD is expected to grow revenues by 14% in 2024. If investors are judging the stock\u2019s performance relative to sales, there might be very little reason to invest in AMD currently.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is ever a stock to sell. It has provided 10X returns over the past decade and Windows and Office continue to provide a fortress of strength in which the company dwells.\n\nDespite those obvious strengths there are concerns that Microsoft is overpriced at the moment primarily due to AI. Any investor has simply to look at the company\u2019s current P/E ratio of 39x, well above its 10-year median.\n\nHow much of that increase in valuation is justified? Is the $30 CoPilot add on worth it? No one really knows because as my colleague Dana Blankenhorn pointed out, Microsoft didn\u2019t break out its performance.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella was happy to boast about its initial uptake earlier this year but not much else has been said since. That\u2019s a troublesome sign. Microsoft is well protected by Windows and Office so any AI bubble burst won\u2019t crush it. However, it may not be a bad time to reap profits now as bubble questions continue to swirl.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has sunken like a stone in 2024. Therefore, it probably won\u2019t be too difficult to persuade readers to avoid it moving forward.\n\nThere was a lot of hype around Intel due to AI earlier in the year. Intel announced the launch of a systems foundry designed for the AI era in February. That was around the tail end of the time during which Intel was seen as a legitimate competitor to Nvidia.\n\nHowever, Intel lags well behind Nvidia when it comes to AI chips. Intel\u2019s leading chip is called Gaudi-3. Those chips are supposed to compete with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming Blackwell chips which will be released around the same time. The problem is that Intel\u2019s chips are not nearly as powerful.\n\nThe result is that Intel\u2019s opportunity to benefit from the AI halo may already be over. Furthermore, Intel\u2019s revenues peaked in 2021. They\u2019re not expected to rebound to those levels until 2028.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) An image of a grey TSMC corporation building with the \"tsmc\" logo in red.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is a stock that is at once one of the best investments and one of those which is most exposed to the AI bubble.\n\nIt is one of the best investments at the moment because it is so exposed to the AI opportunity. Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing serves as the world\u2019s foundry, producing the world\u2019s most advanced chips including those for AI applications. It is because of that excellent positioning that the stock has grown by nearly 80% in 2024.\n\nThe flip side of that tremendous growth is obvious: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also heavily exposed to the inherent dangers of an AI bubble. Given that TSM provides the actual chips sold by Nvidia, AMD and many others, it stands to be punished heavily if and when things go wrong.\n\nTSM\u2019s P/E ratio is currently the highest it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s more than double its median over the last decade. That\u2019s a bit worrisome given the fact that the company has been the foundry to the world during that period. The hype around AI is the clear reason it\u2019s become so valuable in 2024. As questions continue to swirl about the true value of AI, TSM will continue to be on bubble watch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Gems Poised for 100% Gains in 18 Months",
        "content": "Finding undervalued growth stocks in the middle of a bull market is no easy task. By definition, they are investments rising in value over time. With the S&P 500 trading up about 25% so far this year, locating these discounted hidden gems remains a challenge but doable.\n\nJust because a growth stock has gained in value doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t keep rising. Letting your winners run is a valid investment strategy because, like Newton\u2019s Law of Motion, an object in motion tends to remain in motion. Unless a calamity strikes these growth stocks, there is a good chance they will keep right on rising.\n\nTheir growth also doesn\u2019t mean they are anywhere near full valuation. A growth stock\u2019s expansion may be outpacing the multiple the market is assigning. That\u2019s the type of undervalued growth stock we\u2019re looking for: its fundamentals are in place and widening just as it is beginning to realize its full potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three undervalued growth stocks that fit the bill. Let\u2019s dive in to see why they should be able to double in value by the end of 2025.\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (TKC) Multiple hands holding up their cell phones\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first question you might have about Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri (NYSE:TKC) is: who? The company is the leading mobile phone operator in Turkey but also provides broadband services to consumers and businesses, digital payment systems, cloud services and data center operations.\n\nTurkey is an important emerging market that saw its economy expand 4.5% in 2023 despite a major earthquake early in the year that killed over 53,000 people and injured more than 107,000 people. Between 2002 and 2022, Turkey\u2019s GDP increased by an average of 5.4% a year. Although economic growth is expected to slow this year to 3%, the World Bank expects \u201crobust\u201d growth in the years ahead.\n\nTurkcell has been in business for 30 years, originally as a telecom operator but evolving into a significant technology provider. Its stock is up 71% in 2024 and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Shares go for just eight times next year\u2019s earnings estimates and Wall Street forecasts profits will rapidly expand at a 31% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). TKC stock trades at a tiny fraction of that growth while going for less than twice its sales and a bargain-basement 5x free cash flow (FCF).\n\nTurkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri might not be a household name but is a dramatically undervalued growth stock. It should readily double from its current $8 per share level, making it one of the best undervalued growth stocks to pick.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenesis Energy (GEL) Pipelines in the desert\n\nSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough Genesis Energy\u2019s (NYSE:GEL) name might make you think it is a utility, in reality it is a midstream operator in the oil and gas industry. Headquartered in Houston, Genesis operates primarily around the Gulf coast region. It has one of the largest offshore pipeline networks in the Deepwater area; is one of the biggest sodium and soda ash producers; and is one of the largest crude and petroleum transportation providers serving\u00a0 two of the largest refinery complexes in the U.S.\n\nBecause it operates under long-term take-or-pay contracts, it means Genesis gets paid regardless of whether its customers accept delivery of its products or services or not. Those superlatives are not going without notice.\n\nThe midstream operator\u2019s stock is up 24% in 2024 and\u00a048% over the past year. Yet shares trade at 11 times earnings estimates and a fraction of its sales and projected earnings growth. Those profits are forecast to expand by 44% annually for the next five years.\n\nThe one complicating factor for Genesis investors is it is organized as a master limited partnership (MLP). That introduces potentially complex tax issues depending upon whether you invest through a taxable brokerage account or in an IRA. But if the stock meets your individual needs, GEL is an undervalued growth stock ready to double.\n\niShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) two businesspeople sit at a table stacking up coins in the shape of an ascending bar chart. overlooked growth stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArguably the most surprising undervalued growth stock to buy is iShares S&P Growth ETF (NYSE:IVW), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks large U.S. companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. Basically, it is an ETF growth stock tracking growth stocks.\n\nWhat makes IVW a stock to buy is the likelihood the broad market itself will continue to appreciate in value. Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell just said the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach regarding inflation. What it sees so far is positive. That suggests the Fed could cut interest sooner than expected, which could unleash a massive groundswell of economic expansion.\n\nBy investing in the ETF, you get broad exposure to leading growth stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), its three largest holdings. With a minuscule expense ratio of 0.18%, you also get them at low cost.\n\nA single share of Microsoft stock goes for $460 per share versus IVW trading for less than $100 a pop. That means you can own a basket of the biggest growth stocks on the market at a significantly cheaper price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Most investors are primarily concerned with building long-term wealth as opposed to capturing quick gains. Of course, those same investors would gladly reap short-term gains if they were reliable, but they aren\u2019t. It remains incredibly difficult to identify stocks that will perform well over the short term. Yet, identifying stocks with the potential to create long-term wealth has proven easier.\n\nGiven time, companies with readily identifiable fundamental strengths tend to increase in value. These are the kinds of stocks you\u2019re likely to find recommended by value investors such as Warren Buffett.\n\nInvesting in strong companies with durable competitive advantages is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. These are the kind of companies that routinely maintain strong pricing advantages over the long term that create all kinds of beneficial internal economics. The companies discussed below certainly benefit from those factors and more, which is the reason to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) microsoft stock\n\nSource: Peteri / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best reasons to believe Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock will continue to create long-term wealth for investors is its forecast growth.\n\nMicrosoft reported just under $212 billion in sales in 2023. That figure is expected to approximately double by 2028. Given how successful the company has been in investing in artificial intelligence, it\u2019s easy to see why Microsoft continues to be so loved.\n\nIt is one of the so-called hyperscaler companies looking to commoditize artificial intelligence. It is doing so by buying up massive quantities of AI chips and implementing them at its data centers.\n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more and more a part of our lives Microsoft should become that much more valuable.\n\nThe strategy is highly logical and is part of a broader thinking that characterizes AI as the new digital gold. Outside of AI, Microsoft continues to be subsidized by the strength of its Office and Windows products. Microsoft has multiple ways to continue winning and creating long-term wealth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another strong choice for investors looking for stocks that will create long-term wealth. I believe many investors automatically discount Amazon and other similarly sized companies for the simple fact that they believe past growth is not replicable.\n\nAfter all, Amazon reported $574 billion in revenues in 2023. It\u2019s therefore easy to presume growth will slow due to reaching such a massive scale. Yet, it\u2019s possible that Amazon could reach $1 trillion in sales by 2028. It is predicted to come very close as it will grow by roughly 70% over that period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat I particularly like about Amazon is the company\u2019s substantial investment in Anthropic, for which it recently completed its $4 billion investment. I believe Amazon will benefit substantially from that investment as Anthropic is noted to take a slower, more pragmatic approach to AI development than rival OpenAI. That developmental approach is likely to yield better results in the enterprise space, which requires greater accuracy and where substantial revenues will flow from.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has long proven capable of creating long-term wealth. It is primarily an income-producing stock with much of its long-term wealth-creating ability coming from dividends. However, it also produces substantial share price gains as oil prices peak.\n\nWe now may be entering another such period as Brent crude surges past $86 per barrel. Analysts believe that it could peak above $90. Standard Chartered says the current supply deficit characterizing the third quarter will spill into the fourth quarter. That suggests Exxon Mobil will perform strongly throughout the remainder of 2024.\n\nAnd while investors should be able to capitalize on those supply shortfalls, there are other reasons to like ExxonMobil. Most investors will compare it to Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the other common Big Oil choice. But with a choice between the two, Exxon is better at creating more value than Chevron. The peak oil argument was overdone and companies like ExxonMobil continue to have the ability to create long-term wealth for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Eir Nols\u00f8e reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe number of UK millionaires is expected to shrink by 17pc between 2023 and 2028, according to Swiss investment bank UBS, which published its research just days after Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s landslide victory.\n\nIts annual Global Wealth Report revealed that around 519,000 millionaires are expected to quit the UK over the period, which is the most pronounced drop of all the countries it tracks.\n\nThis will take the country\u2019s total tally to 2.5 million.\n\nThe Netherlands is the only other country expected to post a decline, although its drop is much smaller at 4pc.\n\nBy contrast, countries like Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand are among those with the sharpest rises.\n\nThe projection comes as Britain\u2019s high earners fear a series of new wealth taxes under Labour, alongside a renewed crackdown on non-doms.\n\nHowever, Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global, said the reasons for the drop went beyond just higher taxes.\n\nRead the full story...\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Szu Ping Chan reports:\n\nCatherine Mann\u00a0said the rising cost of services such as airfares and restaurant bills and ongoing \u201clabour market tightness\u201d meant wages were still rising at a pace that was not consistent with the Bank\u2019s 2pc inflation target.\n\nMs Mann also described the drop in inflation back to 2pc in May as \u201ctouch and go\u201d as she warned price rises were likely to climb again in the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cUntil I see some sustained deceleration in services prices, I\u2019m really not in a position [to cut rates],\u201d she said.\n\nEchoing comments made by Bank\u2019s chief economist Huw Pill, Ms Mann highlighted that services prices were still rising by almost 6pc on an annual basis. \u201cWe have to see some discipline in service sector price growth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe 2pc that we have seen is touch and go, meaning we\u2019re going to be above 2pc for the rest of the year, and that matters for my decision making.\u201d\n\n05:50 PM BST\n\nEuropean shares rise amid real estate boost\n\nEuropean shares advanced on Wednesday amid broad-based gains and upbeat corporate updates, while investors digested more comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s second day of testimony.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.9pc, buoyed by a 2.1pc rise in real estate shares.\n\nFrench stocks were also up nearly 0.9pc after falling yesterday, as markets assessed the turbulent political situation following Sunday\u2019s legislative election.\n\nSupporting share prices, the yield on government bonds across the euro zone fell in a sign of investors unwinding the political risk premium they had attached to the countries before the France\u2019s parliamentary runoff vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerome Powell said on his second day of congressional testimony he was not ready to conclude that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2pc though he had \u201csome confidence of that\u201d.\n\nMarkets are now awaiting June inflation data out of the US and Germany due on Thursday to gauge the timing of potential interest rate cuts.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\nEx-BBC boss wields the axe at CNN\n\nThe former head of the BBC is wielding the axe at CNN as the Left-leaning news channel grapples with a decline in traditional TV viewing. James Warrington reports:\n\nSir Mark Thompson, chief executive of CNN, has outlined plans to cut roughly 100 jobs as the company merges newsrooms across its digital and pay-TV operations.\n\nIn a memo to employees, the news chief said the cuts represented less than 3pc of CNN\u2019s workforce of around 3,500 people.\n\nSir Mark, who served as director general of the BBC until 2012, was appointed to CNN last year to lead turnaround efforts at the struggling cable network as it tries to navigate the shift to streaming.\n\nAlongside the job cuts, the broadcasting boss said CNN will launch a new digital subscription business before the end of the year.\n\nHe said this service will generate more than a billion dollars in revenue and help to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the network.\n\nCNN has struggled to embrace the shift to the streaming era, while the liberal channel also suffered a collapse in viewing figures following the election of US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe network launched the CNN+ streaming service in 2022, but this was quickly shut down following the merger that formed its new parent company Warner Bros Discovery.

The Fed responded by raising its benchmark rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has plummeted from its 9.1pc peak to 3.3pc.\n\nPowell told the House panel on Wednesday that, to avoid damaging the economy, the Fed likely wouldn\u2019t wait until inflation reached its 2pc target before it would start cutting rates.

Lucy Burton reports:\n\nThe 4 Day Week Campaign, which is urging bosses to sign up to its second nationwide trial later this year, said that \u201cwith a new Labour Government, change is in the air\u201d.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, sought to distance himself from the idea on Wednesday, with a spokesman confirming that \u201cthis isn\u2019t [the] Government\u2019s planned policy\u201d.\n\nThis is thought to be the first time that Labour has publicly set out its stance on the topic, after facing pressure from unions and activists to adopt a four-day working week as an official policy in the run-up to the election.\n\nRead the full story...\n\n04:27 PM BST\n\nPayment problems stifle Russian imports of Chinese cars\n\nPayment issues between Russia and China, caused by US sanctions, pose serious issues for Russian imports of Chinese cars that have supplied the domestic market over the last two years, the head of Russia\u2019s car dealers\u2019 association has said.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have resorted to complex steps to try to avoid payment delays, including a workaround using small, regional Chinese banks, as the threat of secondary US sanctions on Chinese banks that facilitate trade with Russia deters larger lenders.\n\nAlexei Podshchekoldin, president of the Association of Russian Automobile Dealers, said the problem was particularly serious for smaller importers, who had seen payments bounce.\n\nThe upshot is fewer exports for China, while Russian importers lose business and possibly face added costs.\n\nChinese carmakers have already seized more than half of Russia\u2019s car market since Western competitors pulled out, taking their technology and know-how with them, after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nChina\u2019s car exports to Russia were up 36pc year-on-year in money terms to $4.86bn (\u00a33.78bn) in January-May, according to Chinese customs statistics.\n\n04:23 PM BST\n\nLabour plans for living wage could hinder interest rate cuts, warns broker\n\nThe Government\u2019s plans to hike the living wage \u201ccould weigh on BOE [Bank of England\u2019s] rate cut hopes\u201d, a leading broker has claimed.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said:\n\nThe Tory government raised the living wage by nearly 10pc in April, which was the largest increase since the Blair era. Labour have said that they could increase it even more.\n\nBack in June, the BOE cautioned that the increase in the living wage could feed through to wage growth more broadly and lead to upward pressure on price growth, particularly core prices.\n\nThus, now that Labour have won the election and have said that they will focus on workers\u2019 rights, the BOE may be more reluctant to cut rates until they know exactly how much upward pressure on wages could be coming down the pipeline.\n\nWe may not know the government\u2019s plans for raising the living wage until we get the budget in the Autumn, thus a rate cut could be pushed further out to the latter part of [the year], especially if the new government\u2019s policies lead to the BOE and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] raising their UK growth forecasts.\n\n04:20 PM BST\n\nBP, Shell and Total take stake in UAE energy project\n\nBritish energy giants BP and Shell, along with France\u2019s TotalEnergies, will each take a 10pc stake in a liquefied natural gas project in the United Arab Emirates, state energy giant Adnoc has said.\n\nJapanese trading company Mitsui will also acquire 10 percent of the Ruwais LNG plant, scheduled to come online in 2028, Adnoc said.\n\nAdnoc, the UAE\u2019s key revenue-earner, will retain a 60 percent majority stake.\n\nThe \u00a0plant, currently under development in Abu Dhabi, is expected to produce about 9.6m metric tonnes a year, more than doubling the company\u2019s LNG production capacity in the UAE.\n\nGas is being touted as cleaner than other fossil fuels as countries around the world strive to reduce their emissions and slow global warming.\n\nDemand for gas spiked following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with several Gulf countries looking to boost output.\n\nQatar this year announced new plans to expand output from the world\u2019s biggest natural gas field, saying it will boost capacity to 142 million tonnes per year before 2030.\n\n04:12 PM BST\n\nRevolut backer raises \u00a31.8bn to invest in UK tech businesses\n\nEarly Revolut-backer Index Ventures has raised a fresh $2.3bn (\u00a31.8bn) to invest in fast-growing businesses as the firm hailed the prospects of the UK tech sector. Matt Field reports:\n\nThe venture capital fund, which recently expanded its London presence with a new office in Soho, said on Wednesday it had closed an $800m venture fund as well as a $1.5bn fund aimed at more established businesses.\n\nThe new funding comes as venture investors pile into artificial intelligence companies amid a groundswell of interest in the technology. Index has backed companies including Mistral, the French OpenAI rival, which was recently valued at $6bn.\n\nHannah Seal, a partner at Index, told The Telegraph: \u201cThe UK has always been a really important ecosystem for Index. We have invested \u00a31bn into 144 UK start-ups.\n\n\u201cWe expect that will continue. But also we are seeing incredible AI talent coming out of the UK.\u201d\n\nLord Livermore, the Labour growth minister, said: \u201cBoosting private investment into the UK economy is an urgent priority for our growth mission, so I very warmly welcome\u00a0Index\u00a0Ventures\u2019 commitment to Britain and their vote of confidence in our VC sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how private investment in the technologies of the future will create thousands of jobs so people across the UK can benefit.\u201d\n\nMs Seal added: \u201cOur incentives and our goals are aligned with the government - boost the productivity of the UK and make it a powerhouse for start-ups.\u201d\n\n04:05 PM BST\n\nOil hits two-week low amid worries about weak Chinese demand\n\nOil prices hit a two-week low today, before adding around 0.4pc today after a American Petroleum Institute report came out showing shrinking US investories.\n\nTraders have been concerned about weak Chinese demand, and uncertainly over US interest rates has also been cited as contributing to the drop.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at online trading platform IG.\n\nFaced with underwhelming Chinese data, and expected supply increases thanks to Hurricane Beryl\u2019s swerving of key production facilities, oil prices briefly hit a two-week low today.\n\nThe summer demand hopes that took prices to a one-month high have been swiftly replaced by worries about weak Chinese demand. Investors continue to watch the Middle East however, anxious about the lingering possibility of Israel widening its conflict to take on Hezbollah.\n\n03:57 PM BST\n\nUS inflation rate will show \u2018slow decrease\u2019\n\nThe US releases new inflation data this week, which will give traders a clearer steer on the likely speed of interest rate cuts. The Consumer Price Index is due out on Thursday and the Producer Price Index report is expected on Friday.\n\nBets on a quarter point rate cut by September ticked up to 74pc, up from around 70pc on Tuesday and 45pc a month ago, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch. It comes after Fed chairmanJerome Powell gave tesimony in the US Congress yesterday in which he said that there had been \u2018considerable progress\u2019 on inflation.\n\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said:\n\nPowell came in a little bit more dovish than we expected ... he\u2019s purposely trying to signal to markets that if there is a good inflation print this week, September is back on the table as a possibility for a rate cut.\n\nJulien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said:\n\nWe expect to see a continued albeit slow decrease in the rate of inflation. In particular, price pressures should have stayed relatively elevated within services ... The direction of travel remains unchanged and we continue to expect lower inflation ahead. As such and with increasing signs that the US economy is slowing down, we believe that the Fed could be in a position to lower interest rates in September.\n\n03:47 PM BST\n\nChip giant AMD to buy AI startup in race against Nvidia\n\nAmerican chip giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said today it will acquire Finnish artificial intelligence startup Silo AI for about $665m (\u00a3518m) in cash as the company tries to enhance its AI chip capabilities to compete against industry leader Nvidia.\n\nAcquiring Silo AI will help AMD improve the development and deployment of AMD-powered AI models and help potential customers build complex AI models with the company\u2019s chips, AMD said.\n\nSilo AI will also strengthen AMD\u2019s software development capabilities.\n\nWhile the deal will not impact AMD\u2019s financial performance, it \u201cunlocks a significant amount of business moving forward,\u201d AMD\u2019s Vamsi Boppana said.\n\nAMD declined to discuss how much business the acquisition would generate over time.\n\nThe acquisition marks the latest step from AMD in a series of moves aimed at expanding its footprint in the AI landscape.

The service is a key part of Microsoft's strategy for growing its game business, which lags its rivals in hardware, Sony Group and Nintendo.

        "content": "Microsoft Game Pass, a Netflix-like service for the company\u2019s video games, is undergoing some substantial changes that are likely to rile up the always vocal gaming audience.\n\nMicrosoft has increased the price of all tiers and has phased out one of its lowest-priced options. Effective immediately, the Game Pass console tier has been eliminated and replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard, a tier that will not include day-one releases of big titles such as the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\n\nGaining access to new releases the day they hit stores is one of the biggest draws for many Game Pass members. (Existing Game Pass for Console subscribers who have automatic payment renewal enabled on their accounts will be able to continue to use it for now and will retain access to day-one games.)\n\nSubscribers to the Game Pass Ultimate tier, which will keep day-one games for new and existing subscribers, will now pay $20 a month, a $3 per month increase. The Game Pass Standard tier will cost $15 per month, which is notably higher than the $11 per month Game Pass for Console subscribers paid.\n\nExisting customers will begin paying the higher rates on Sept. 12.\n\nWhile the Xbox console is better known to many, Game Pass has become the heart of Microsoft\u2019s game unit in recent years. Sony has vastly outsold the company in the hardware space for the past two generations of game systems. With Game Pass, though, Microsoft has opened up a way for people to play its games without investing in a $300 piece of hardware. It also appeals to console owners who can play both an extensive catalog of older titles as well as new ones without plunking down $60 or more each time.\n\nIn February, Microsoft announced that 34 million people subscribe to the service, a jump of 11 million from two years prior.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

CISPE had argued Microsoft made it too difficult for customers to change cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services.\n\n\u201cAfter working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we\u2019ve not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in the statement.\n\nThe agreement will allow CISPE members to use enhanced Microsoft Azure features, with service providers permitted to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures, the association said in a statement.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said it would assess the impact of the settlement on competition in European cloud markets.\n\nThe deal however was not offered to CISPE\u2019s largest member, Amazon Web Services or to Google\u2019s Cloud Platform and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s cloud service, CISPE said.\n\nAWS said in a statement that the settlement \u201cdoes nothing for the vast majority of Microsoft customers who are still unable to use the cloud of their choice in Europe and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe agreement between Microsoft and CISPE puts an end to a long-running back-and-forth between the parties, that saw Microsoft make a spate of concessions in order to appease the concerns of cloud service providers. On the heels of those complaints, EU regulators had been informally asking market rivals and customers about Microsoft\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe,\u201d Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\n\nMore recently, its $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is the focus of an informal investigation by regulators, after concerns emerged about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology. In June, the EU also accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.\n\n(Updates with European Commission comment in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving Looser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom Psychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch How to Invest During a High Interest Rate Era The First Porsche 911 Hybrid Is $165,000 Carrera GTS: Review\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "It\u2019s for the best that Microsoft and Apple won\u2019t be observing OpenAI\u2019s board meetings",
        "content": "OpenAI\u2019s board meetings were about to get really weird, with not one but two major customers and partners sitting in as observers. But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year\u2019s leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\n\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won\u2019t take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \u201cprovided insights into the board\u2019s activities without compromising its independence,\u201d and the role was no longer necessary because \u201cwe have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.\u201d\n\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI\u2014they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner\u2014there\u2019s now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\n\nSecondly\u2026well, here I\u2019m going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week\u2019s essay about the subject:\n\n\u201cThe issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions\u2026I question how this \u2018observation\u2019 can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\u201d\n\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\n\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of AI, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI\u2019s only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOracle is a great company\u2026but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\u201d Musk tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant\u2014a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It\u2019s called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can\u2019t wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday\u2014which appropriately focuses on AI\u2019s potential for surreptitiously influencing people\u2014and you can also read Jeremy\u2019s own rundown of the book\u2019s key themes in yesterday\u2019s Eye On AI essay.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains among the top AI stocks investors look to for growth right now. Microsoft stock is certainly among the best long-term options for investors looking for dominant growth long term.\n\nThere are many reasons for such a view. The company\u2019s core software business is the cash cow allowing the company to reinvest a tremendous amount of capital into AI integrations for its core products.\n\nThe company\u2019s cloud computing division continues to drive vigorous growth, and is competing for market share lead in a high-profit and fast-growing space. Microsoft recently introduced Copilot+ PCs with advanced AI capabilities and continues to innovate in AI integration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese factors alone make the stock worth considering. Let\u2019s dive into a few other reasons why investors are so bullish on Microsoft stock, and why this is a Magnificent 7 stock to buy and hold long term.\n\nCommitted OpenAI Expansion\n\nMicrosoft has deepened its commitment to Hong Kong by introducing generative artificial intelligence services in education, following restrictions by OpenAI in the region.\n\nCollaborating with the Education University of Hong Kong Jockey Club Primary School, Microsoft integrated AI tools, including chatbots and text-to-image generators powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT and Dall-E models, into science classes for approximately 220 fifth and sixth-grade students during the last academic year.\n\nThe company also expanded its K-12 presence in Hong Kong following collaborations with eight local universities last year to promote AI services. Partnering with Gamenoodlesoup, an education and tech developer, since April 2023, the company tailored Microsoft Azure cloud services to meet specific school needs.\n\nThis is one example of many AI integrations that investors may not be aware of that could spur additional growth over time. The number of verticals in this space is incredible, and Microsoft remains among the best options to consider in this regard.\n\nAI Events\n\nMicrosoft unveiled a key AI integration using Arm (NASDAQ:ARM) processors at a Surface event on May 20th. Key highlights included the launch of Copilot Plus PCs, featuring built-in NPUs for local AI tasks like Recall.\n\nAlso unveiled were Surface Laptop and Surface Pro Tablet powered by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X processors, promising enhanced performance and efficiency. The event showcased new Copilot Plus PCs from a range of notable PC providers.\n\nCompetition certainly exists in this space, with others looking to launch an AI PC chipset in late 2025 for Windows PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, the company\u2019s status as a key PC software provider should position the company well to have its core AI technologies integrated into new machines as they\u2019re released. It will certainly be important for investors to watch how these unveilings unfold over time.\n\nAt Microsoft\u2019s Surface event, the company also introduced a lineup of Copilot Plus PCs from leading OEMs. Among them, the Swift 14 AI stands out with Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors, offering options like the 12-core Snapdragon X Elite or 10-core X Plus, with up to 32GB RAM and 1TB M.2 SSD storage.\n\nMicrosoft Stock Remains a Strong Buy\n\nMicrosoft leverages not just business software and AI but also gaming and social media for substantial revenue. Brands like LinkedIn and Xbox contribute significantly. The company\u2019s Activision Blizzard acquisition boosted gaming revenue.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s clear that there are so many verticals and business lines Microsoft can leverage for growth that investors are certainly pricing in the fair amount of enthusiasm into this stock.\n\nOver the long-term, MSFT stock has been as reliable a long-term investment as exists. Shares of this tech giant are up 23% year-to-date and 233% over the past five years. Analysts predict potential new highs with an average price target indicating 12% upside, while the highest target of $600 suggests a 31% gain from prices at the time of writing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market has shown remarkable resilience in the first half of 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record highs despite economic uncertainty. Chipmakers and AI-related companies have been standout market-beating stocks. Meanwhile, other sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary are also driving much of the index\u2019s gains.\n\nHere are seven market-beating stocks that have high growth potential and are starting to outperform the stock market and still have room to run higher.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been on a tear lately. Most growth investors are kicking themselves for not buying shares sooner. The stock has tripled year-to-date, recently hitting fresh highs above $900.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSMCI is riding major tailwinds from the AI boom. It produces critical server technology, and partners closely with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to power data centers. Some analysts even view Super Micro as an \u201cAI proxy\u201d that could attract investors if enthusiasm for Nvidia starts to wane.\n\nThe company\u2019s financials look stellar too, with revenue surging over 200% last quarter. And I don\u2019t see this slowing down anytime soon. Super Micro has its finger on the pulse of several key megatrends like cloud computing, AI and data centers that should provide a long growth runway.\n\nSure, the stock isn\u2019t cheap at 38 times forward earnings, but I think that\u2019s more than justified, given the explosive growth. A few analysts have lofty price targets of up to $1,500. Of course, there are risks, but all things considered I\u2019m very bullish.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor powerhouse that provides chips for a wide range of applications. The company\u2019s stock has surged over 21% in the past month alone and nearly doubled over the past year.\n\nBroadcom recently posted a strong earnings beat primarily driven by insatiable demand for its AI-focused chips. Management is now forecasting $11 billion in AI-related revenue for the full year. Thus, Broadcom is now one of the market-beating stocks for investors looking to ride the AI megatrend alongside Nvidia.\n\nWhile the analyst community is largely bullish, with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus and a flurry of price target hikes, I do have some reservations about Broadcom\u2019s lofty valuation. The stock is priced for perfection with a forward P/E ratio pushing 37x.\n\nSo, where do I stand? I believe Broadcom\u2019s strong positioning in AI and cloud computing can power robust growth ahead. As long as the AI hype stays, AVGO should outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the company behind the current AI rally, as it initially made large investments into OpenAI. It also has productivity tools that the white-collar sector cannot survive without. It is hard to find a single tech field in which this company is not, or has not, competed.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s Azure cloud platform is rapidly gaining ground on market leader Amazon Web Services. Azure gained 31% market share last quarter thanks in large part to surging demand for AI services. Microsoft\u2019s close partnership with OpenAI and its Copilot AI offerings are also fueling excitement. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 already using Copilot.\n\nAnalysts are largely bullish, with Piper Sandler recently reiterating a \u201cBuy\u201d rating and $465 price target on the stock. However, some caution Microsoft\u2019s valuation is getting stretched, with the average analyst price target implying just 7% upside from current levels.\n\nNonetheless, I believe Microsoft\u2019s strong positioning in AI, cloud and other growth markets should continue to propel shares higher. The company\u2019s ability to drive synergies across its sprawling product portfolio is a key competitive advantage that the market still underappreciates.\n\nHEICO Corporation (HEI) The website for Heico is shown with a magnifying glass enlarging the company's logo.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nHEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) has been riding high lately, and I believe the aerospace and defense powerhouse is well-positioned to continue its impressive run. The company recently reported stellar Q2 2024 results. Earnings per share of 88 cents handily beat estimates by 8 cents. And, revenue soared 39% year-over-year to $955 million. The Flight Support Group has been the key driver of this growth. market-beating stocks: HEI FSG segment\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHEICO is benefiting from several powerful megatrends in its core markets. Air travel demand has come roaring back post-pandemic. This has driven strong sales of HEICO\u2019s cost-saving aftermarket parts to airlines looking to keep aging fleets flying. The company is also seeing robust growth in its defense business as geopolitical tensions and the war in Ukraine spur higher military spending globally.\n\nAnalysts are taking notice of HEICO\u2019s momentum. In recent months, the stock has scored a slew of price target hikes from top firms like Bank of America, Truist, and RBC Capital. While HEICO shares don\u2019t come cheap at 64 times forward earnings, I believe the premium valuation is justified given the company\u2019s exceptional growth profile, high-margin business model, and significant runway in both commercial aerospace and defense.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) has faced its share of challenges, from losing market share in desktop CPUs to AMD to delays in getting its AI chips to market. But there are also some promising tailwinds that could help turn things around.\n\nFor one, Intel is getting a major boost from the U.S. government to the tune of $8.5 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act to bolster its AI capabilities. That\u2019s a huge vote of confidence. Intel is also generating buzz with its upcoming Lunar Lake chip, which is supposed to deliver big performance gains for AI workloads in laptops. Analysts at Melius Research even predict Intel could be poised for a second-half rebound as an \u201cAI laggard\u201d that\u2019s ready to play catch-up.\n\nIf Intel can execute on its product roadmap, ride the coattails of the generative AI megatrend, and make the most of its government support, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the stock surprise to the upside. It\u2019s a high-risk, high-reward bet, but one that I believe could pay off for patient investors willing to look past the near-term noise.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) has been riding high, and I\u2019m quite bullish on the stock. The drone and missile maker reported stellar Q4 results that blew past expectations, with earnings of 43 cents per share crushing estimates. Revenue also hit a record $197 million. Looking ahead, AeroVironment sees clear skies, guiding for nearly 12% top-line growth in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe company is benefiting from soaring demand for its cutting-edge drone tech, especially its Switchblade loitering munitions that have proven highly effective on the battlefield. With rising geopolitical tensions, military spending should provide a nice tailwind. UnCrewed and Loitering Munitions segments have seen exceptional growth.

Some analysts argue the impressive headline numbers mask underlying concerns about profitability. Shares dipped nearly 4% after the report.\n\nRegardless, the Street is getting more optimistic, with earnings upgrades and price target hikes. Given AeroVironment\u2019s strong positioning in the fast-growing drone space and ability to outpace the broader industry, I think the long-term trajectory remains positive. This is one of the market-beating stocks that is worth keeping on your radar.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been aggressively pushing into AI, but not everyone on Wall Street is convinced just yet. The creative software giant recently posted solid Q2 2024 earnings that beat expectations, driven by strong growth in its Digital Media segment. Adobe is betting big that AI will expand its addressable market with innovations like its Firefly generative AI and new AI-powered tools for Photoshop, Acrobat and more.\n\nHowever, despite the recent spike, the stock is still down by 2% year-to-date. There are worries about rising competition from rivals like Canva and Microsoft in the generative AI space. Some analysts have also expressed skepticism about how quickly Adobe can monetize its AI investments. Citi warned that consensus estimates for the second half look \u201csomewhat aggressive.\u201d\n\nThat said, I remain optimistic about Adobe\u2019s long-term prospects. The shift to digital creativity and marketing shows no signs of slowing. Adobe\u2019s entrenched market position and strong brand give it a major advantage as it races to infuse AI across its product suite. Recent partner enthusiasm around offerings like GenStudio and Firefly Services is also encouraging. While the stock may stay volatile in the near term, patient investors could be rewarded as Adobe is among the market-beating stocks riding the AI wave.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia Recently Completed a 10-for-1 Stock Split, and These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Members Look Ready to Follow in Its Footsteps",
        "content": "Although most investors are captivated by the long-term potential of artificial intelligence (AI), companies enacting stock splits are an equally hot trend on Wall Street.\n\nA stock split is an event that allows publicly traded companies an opportunity to cosmetically alter their share price and outstanding share count. It's superficial in the sense that stock splits don't affect a company's market valuation or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe two variations of stock splits are forward and reverse. With a forward-stock split, companies are purposely reducing their nominal share price to make it more affordable for everyday investors and/or their employees. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split is aimed at increasing a company's share price, often with the goal of meeting continued listing standards on a major stock exchange.\n\nAlthough some reverse-stock splits can be long-term winners, most investors tend to focus their attention on public companies conducting forward splits. High-flying stocks in need of a forward split are usually out-executing and out-innovating their competition.\n\nSince 2024 began, in the neighborhood of a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a stock split -- but none have garnered more attention than AI titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nNvidia was the most-anticipated stock split of 2024 on Wall Street\n\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) in January 1999, Nvidia has completed six forward splits. The latest was announced by the company's board on May 22 -- a 10-for-1 stock split -- with an effective date of June 7. At the snap of a finger, Nvidia's share price of more than $1,200 was adjusted to a little north of $120.\n\nThe reason Nvidia required its largest stock split since going public has everything to do with its AI dominance.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia's AI-focused graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the undisputed standard in high-compute data centers. By some estimates, the company holds a virtual monopoly on the AI-GPUs that were shipped for use in enterprise data centers last year.\n\nOn top of being the preferred hardware provider for AI-accelerated data centers, demand for the company's H100 GPU has overwhelmed supply. Even with world-leading foundry services company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing rapidly upping its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity for high-bandwidth memory packaging, Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting enterprise demand for its chips. As a result, it's been able to meaningfully increase the selling price of its GPUs, which has provided a hearty boost to its adjusted gross margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has plans to retain its first-mover advantages, as well. While most external competitors are playing catch-up to the H100, Nvidia is expected to release its next-generation AI-GPU architecture, known as Blackwell, later this year. Blackwell offers computational improvements in six areas, including quantum computing, generative AI solutions, and engineering simulation, to name a few. In June, CEO Jensen Huang teased the eventual rollout of its Rubin GPU architecture by 2026.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 stock split has laid a path for other fast-growing, market-leading businesses to follow. Interestingly enough, two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" might be next to answer the call. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nTwo Magnificent Seven components appear ready to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks\n\nAs a quick refresher, the Magnificent Seven account for seven of the largest and most-influential businesses in America. Listed in order of descending market cap, the Magnificent Seven stocks are:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia have market valuations in excess of $3 trillion; Alphabet and Amazon are valued at north of $2 trillion; Meta is worth close to $1.4 trillion; and while Tesla is currently below $1 trillion, it's previously topped this psychological level.\n\nAmong Nvidia's six peers in the Magnificent Seven, two are primed to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven component that's long overdue for a stock split is the only member that's yet to ever complete one. I'm talking about social media colossus Meta Platforms. Shares of the company have risen by more than 1,300% since its debut in 2012, with the company's stock tipping the scales at roughly $540, as of the closing bell on July 5.\n\nThough Meta is among the basket of companies undeniably benefiting from the AI revolution, it would be well-insulated if the AI bubble were to burst at some point in the future. That's because nearly 98% of Meta's sales can be traced to advertising on its social media platforms.\n\nMeta is the parent company behind Facebook, the most-visited social platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. These are some of the world's most-downloaded social apps, and they collectively helped to attract 3.24 billion daily active users during the March-ended quarter. Businesses are well aware that no other social media company offers access to more eyeballs than Meta, which is what affords the company such exceptional ad-pricing power.\n\nSomething else working in Meta's favor is its treasure trove of cash. As of March 31, Meta was sitting on more than $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. To boot, it's also generated north of $76 billion in cash from its operations over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has the luxury of betting big on AI data centers, the metaverse, and augmented/virtual reality devices thanks to his company's immense cash-flow generation.\n\nWith Meta's stock well over $500 and the company's long-term growth prospects improving, its very first stock split would seem to be in the cards.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe second Magnificent Seven member that looks ready to follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become Wall Street's newest stock-split stock is software and cloud juggernaut Microsoft.\n\nSince its March 1986 IPO, Microsoft has conducted nine forward splits. However, the last stock split it completed was back in February 2003! With the world's largest company by market cap closing the July 5 session at $467.56 per share, the ingredients are on the table for Microsoft to announce a stock split.\n\nThe beauty of Microsoft's operating model is that it relies on sizable margins from its legacy operations to fund its high-growth initiatives. Although iconic software segments like Windows and Office aren't growing like they once were, the exceptional moats and margins associated with these divisions provide Microsoft with plenty of cash to reinvest in the cloud and AI, or perhaps deploy when making acquisitions.\n\nThe bread-and-butter to Microsoft's future looks to be cloud infrastructure service platform Azure. While Microsoft has AI and cloud ties in other operating segments, Azure is consistently its fastest-growing segment -- 31% constant-currency sales growth in the fiscal third quarter (ended March 31). Azure ranks second to Amazon Web Services in global cloud infrastructure service market share.\n\nSimilar to Meta Platforms, Microsoft's balance sheet and cash-flow generation afford it the ability to take risks that few other companies can match. It closed out the fiscal third quarter with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated $110 billion in operating cash flow over the TTM period. This is what allowed Microsoft to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard last year for $68.7 billion in an all-cash deal.\n\nWhat better way for the world's largest public company to excite Wall Street and its shareholders than by being the next Magnificent Seven component to announce a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nEU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nIn contrast, the UK and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Krystal Hu and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Powell returns, Microsoft's board seat, Chinese inflation - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Fed chief Jerome Powell makes the climb up Capitol Hill again Wednesday, and trading is largely rangebound on Wall Street ahead of this. Microsoft has decided to give up its seat on the board of Open AI, while weak Chinese inflation data indicates a slowing recovery in this important economy.\n\n1. Powell returns to Capitol Hill\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell returns to Capitol Hill later Wednesday, for the second day of his semi-annual Congressional testimony, this time before the House of Representatives.\n\nPowell flagged the recent labor market cooling, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, as an increasingly important factor in deciding when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates.\n\n\u201cElevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\u201d Powell said Tuesday, noting that the \"labor market has cooled really significantly across so many measures.\"\n\n\"Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment,\u201d Powell said, after noting that labor market indicators \"have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nMarket participants have taken these comments as the Fed chief preparing the ground for a September cut, acknowledging that inflation isn\u2019t the only factor in deciding monetary policy, but will look for more refinement in his comments later in the session.\n\n2. Futures little changed; Powell speaks again\n\nU.S. stock futures are little changed Wednesday, as investors await the second round of testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell on Capitol Hill.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 20 points, or 0.1%, lower, while S&P 500 futures climbed 4 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 35 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday, after Fed head Jerome Powell hinted the central bank could soon start easing monetary policy, while the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed.\n\nPowell continues his testimony later Wednesday, this time before the House Financial Services Committee.\n\nThere\u2019s little in the way of significant U.S. economic data scheduled Wednesday, and all eyes will be on Thursday\u2019s June consumer price index reading, which many see as a key test for the market and the outlook for rate cuts.\n\n3. Microsoft ditches OpenAI board seat\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has given up its observer seat at the board of OpenAI, amid regulatory scrutiny into generative artificial intelligence in both the U.S. and Europe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe software giant stated that such a position was no longer necessary given an improvement in AI start-up's governance in the past eight months.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.\n\nThe observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.\n\n4. Chinese consumer deflation\n\nChinese consumer inflation shrank in June on a monthly basis, while producer inflation contracted for a 20th consecutive month, pointing to a very slow recovery for the world's second-largest economy.\n\nMonth-on-month CPI inflation shrank 0.2% in June, compared to expectations for a contraction of 0.1%, while on an annual basis inflation grew 0.2% year-on-year in June, below expectations for a print of 0.4%.\n\nThe weak CPI reading comes as consumers reined in discretionary spending, spooked by relatively high unemployment as well as concerns over a property market downturn.\n\nThe lackluster consumer spending presents more near-term headwinds for the country, and suggests the likelihood of more stimulus measures by the Chinese government.\n\nProducer price index inflation shrank 0.8% in June, an improvement from the 1.4% contraction seen in the prior month, and shrinking at its slowest pace since February 2023.\n\n5. Crude falls on weak Chinese inflation data\n\nCrude prices fell Wednesday, adding to the previous session\u2019s losses as weak Chinese inflation data raised concerns about the health of the second largest economy in the world.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) dropped 0.4% to $81.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $84.33 a barrel.\n\nConcerns over deflation in China, the world\u2019s largest importer of crude, weighed on the oil market Wednesday, although a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories has limited the losses.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories fell 1.9 million barrels last week, as the summer driving season continued.\n\nBoth benchmarks lost about 3% in the previous three sessions on signs that the Texas energy industry came off relatively unscathed from Hurricane Beryl.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell returns, Microsoft's board seat, Chinese inflation - what's moving markets\n\nEuropean shares rise as earnings take centre stage; Powell's comments on tap\n\nShares gain, dollar firm as September Fed rate cut chances grow\n\nView comments",
