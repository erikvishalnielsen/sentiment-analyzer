        "title": "Insiders At Palo Alto Networks Sold US$4.2m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "content": "In the last year, many Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nPalo Alto Networks Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nThe Independent Director, Carl Eschenbach, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.8m worth of shares at a price of US$237 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$306. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 32% of Carl Eschenbach's holding.\n\nInsiders in Palo Alto Networks didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Insiders Are Selling The Stock\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Palo Alto Networks. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Palo Alto Networks insiders own about US$907m worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Palo Alto Networks Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Palo Alto Networks makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Palo Alto Networks has 3 warning signs (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.\n\nBut note: Palo Alto Networks may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this security software maker have returned -7.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Palo Alto belongs, has lost 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPalo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 points to a change of +25.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palo Alto is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $8 billion and $9.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +13.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +5.6%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish on Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other cybersecurity stocks.\n\nThe growth in internet use has made connectivity ubiquitous across the daily lives of businesses and individuals. It has also opened up more avenues for nefarious individuals or organizations to run financial heists, steal confidential data, or disrupt critical infrastructure and systems. The scale of these activities is staggering as well, with research outlining that as of 2021, cyber criminals caused a stunning $6 trillion in damages - an impact greater than all but the two largest economies in the world.\n\nThese threats have led to the growth of a vibrant cybersecurity industry which came into the spotlight of global media coverage in July 2024 after an outage affected an unbelievable 8.5 million computers worldwide. The outage shed light on the intricate nature of the global computing ecosystem as well as the risks that are present if security infrastructure has a single point of failure. While it's too early to speculate on the losses, some estimates from insurer Parametrix show that insured losses could touch as much as $1 billion for Fortune 500 companies. As if this weren't enough, the insurance firm's CEO believes that the global impact could be several times higher. He estimates that the total financial losses could sit at $15 billion while global insured losses could range between $1.5 billion to $3 billion.\n\nLooking at the scale of these losses, it's only natural to ask, what caused the global cyber outage? Well, the problem started when a cybersecurity provider that was the third biggest cybersecurity company in the world, rolled out an upgrade for its Falcon security platform. This caused systems that used the Windows operating system to crash since the software upgrade included a corrupted file that works with the deepest level of a computer called a kernel. The OS showed the infamous blue screen of death, which is the software's response to protect the user from damage to the kernel that can lead to a loss of data. The disruption lasted for quite a while too since all the systems affected by the update have to be manually booted into safe mode to remove the corrupted file before they can normally function.\n\nComing back to the financial side of the cybersecurity industry, like other sectors, it is also facing disruption through artificial intelligence. Research shows that the AI driven cybersecurity industry was worth $20 billion in 2023. From then until 2027, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.3% for a final value of $49.2 billion. In other words, the industry is expected to more than double in four years. As for the costs of cybersecurity breaches, they're also expected to grow from 2021 levels in the age of AI. These costs are estimated to sit at $8 trillion by 2023 end and jump to $10.5 trillion by 2025 end. The current era in the finance industry is marked by high interest rates, and they've made their impact on cybersecurity mergers too. In 2023, 363 M&A deals were announced in the cybersecurity industry, for an 18.8% annual drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nWithin these deals, strategic buyers, i.e. those that buy firms that align with their business strategies, accounted for 57.3% of the deals. Despite the lower number of deals, valuations remained robust. Between Q4 2020 and Q4 2023, average EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples in the cybersecurity M&A sector were 3.3x and 11.6x, which were higher than the broader averages of 2.1x and 10.4x.\n\nDelving deeper, despite the tough business spending and inflation in 2023, cybersecurity stocks did post some returns. These came at a time when broader software as a service (SaaS) stocks were struggling due to corporate uncertainty about future spending plans. The Houlihan Lokey Cybersecurity Index, which tracks the performance of 28 top cybersecurity stocks, increased by 83% year to date by 2023 end and jumped by 28% during the fourth quarter. These returns were accompanied by a revenue growth of 18% and a stronger earnings growth of 29%, showing the benefits of operating in a high margin software industry which allows cybersecurity stocks to eke out more pennies on the dollar when it comes to profit. While the 83% returns of the index themselves mark a strong lead of 58 percentage points over the flagship S&P, this band widens when we further narrow down the top cybersecurity stocks to only include the high growth firms. Their last twelve month returns as of 2023 end were 101% for an even wider band of 76 percentage points.\n\nShifting towards valuation, like the broader SaaS industry, cybersecurity stocks are primarily evaluated through their enterprise value to revenue. The high growth cybersecurity stocks had a median EV/2024E Revenue ratio was 9.8x. For the medium and low growth stocks, the median ratios were 5.9x and 3.0x. respectively. Crucially, ratios for high and medium growth cybersecurity stocks were significantly higher than the EV/Revenue ratios of acquisition targets that we've shared above. This implies that as far as the current environment for cybersecurity acquisition goes, value seems to be driving at least some deals as businesses find it difficult to raise capital because of high interest rates. As for revenue growth percentage, the median values ranged between 33% for the high growth firms to 4% for the low growth firms.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we ranked the holdings of multiple cybersecurity ETFs by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q1 2024 and selected the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 78\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is a diversified cybersecurity company that offers a variety of products and services such as firewalls, malware protection, and cloud security. Like other software stocks, recurring revenue, billings, margins, and free cash flow are key to its hypothesis. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) has also been positioning itself well to capture the current growth in the interest surrounding cybersecurity. It acquired a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platform provider in December 2023 to grow its portfolio to also secure employees who might be using unofficial devices to access business networks. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) also expanded its event management platform in May 2024 by allowing businesses to integrate their own machine learning models into the service. The firm has also been performing well on the financial front, with its first quarter seeing a whopping 47% ARR jump to $3.8 billion. Its SASE expansion comes when remote work has gained a permanent foothold across industries, and is delivering stable billings for other cybersecurity stocks such as Fortinet even though their billings as a whole are dropping.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)'s management commented on its customer relationships during the Q32 2024 earnings call where it outlined:\n\n\"We have also had questions from analysts and investors on this topic since we reported our Q2 results in February. I thought I\u2019d share more background on how we got here to provide context and also offer a platformization framework for you to help understand why we\u2019re convinced that we can build a much larger business over the next several years and platformization is key to achieving that. When we embarked on our journey to transform our company, we were keen to create interest and convince our customers that we could solve their problems not just with our next-generation firewalls and the associated subscriptions, but also with a set of best-of-breed products across 20-plus categories organized across three platforms. That strategy was hugely successful and saw us achieving nearly $4 billion in NGS ARR.\n\nThe majority of focus of our teams was landing multiple products across our three platforms and our customers. Whether we were able to land at a brand new customer for Palo Alto Networks or we added products from new platforms to our existing customers, we were happy. Landing could range from a single product used in part of the organization to broader usage across the organization. From that lens, if you look at our top 5,000 customers, we have landed two or more of our platforms at about half these customers, and these customers contribute just over 80% of NGS ARR. If you look at it by \u2014 this by platform, we have landed 97% of these top 5,000 network security, over 20% of them in Prisma Cloud, and over 40% with Cortex. By all means, our land-the-platform strategy was extremely successful.\"\n\nOverall PANW ranks 2nd on our list of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PANW) institutional investors lost 4.0% last week but have benefitted from longer-term gains",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Palo Alto Networks' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership Recent sales by insiders\n\nA look at the shareholders of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 78% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$4.4b last week. However, the 27% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Palo Alto Networks.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nPalo Alto Networks already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Palo Alto Networks, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Palo Alto Networks. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Palo Alto Networks, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$970m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Palo Alto Networks. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the  3 warning signs  we've spotted with Palo Alto Networks (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August.Since Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nEarlier this month, Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC talked about the importance of optimism right now and explained why he sees hope for America in the future.\n\nCramer said that the recent political violence made things look \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cgrim.\u201d The CNBC host said this election year has been a \u201cmess, something very much in sync with the tone of the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cramer referred to the recent comments from the CEO of the world\u2019s largest investment manager, and said it seems the end of the world is \u201cnot on the table.\u201d Cramer called the executive\u2019s comments a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d and agreed with the notion that the US economy needs more growth and less business regulation. Cramer said that America has a huge deficit problem but it cannot tax its way out of this.\n\n\u201cBut we can grow our way out of it.\u201d\n\nCramers said we should understand that capitalism is a \u201cforce for good, a force for wealth generation, not just for the rich, but for everybody, as long as they invest.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer urged his viewers to invest in individual stocks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you invest in, as long as you invest.\u201d\n\nFor this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) Among Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August?\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about A10 Networks. He instead pitched Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) as a better buy.\n\n\u201cPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) stock is not even up now since what happend to Crowdstrike. Yet they are cheap.\u201d\n\nCramer also added:\n\n\u201cI like, I do like Palo Alto.\u201d\n\nStrong demand in the cybersecurity industry is boosting Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW). Recently, Baird analysts Shrenik Kothari and Zachary Schneider said customers are focused on ROI and increased spending in the industry is benefitting Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\n\u201cPANW has seen this focus on ROI for some time now. Discounts are offered for larger deals rather than smaller ones to help lock in customers and maximize lifetime value. While still early days, initial customer response to new SASE 3.0 capabilities and AI features has been positive,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and upped their price target to $360 from $340.\n\nLast month, DA Davidson also started covering the stock with a Buy rating and added it to its \u2018Best of Breed Bison\u2019 category of stocks.\n\nDA Davidson\u2019s Rudy Kessinger thinks Palo Alto Networks Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) three platforms will result in vendor consolidation which would be better than other companies. They believe Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) has so far captured only 7% of the market which could reach a whopping $200 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) biggest strength is its Prisma Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) product, which generated about 50% growth in the fiscal third quarter year over year. Another growth catalyst for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) is Thunderdome Defense Information System Agency\u2019s zero-trust network architecture.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGiven our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in\u00a0Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\n\nOverall, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August. While we acknowledge the potential of Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Wall Street rarely sees two trends like artificial intelligence (AI) and stock-split euphoria competing for attention. AI drove record highs for major indices in 2024, while stock splits, though cosmetic, also fueled market excitement for certain names.\n\nStock splits come in forward or reverse types, with forward splits being more popular among investors. Forward splits lower share prices to attract investors, while reverse splits raise prices to meet exchange standards. In 2024, high-profile companies, such as the following, drew significant attention with their splits.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some of these splits, what they mean for investors, and whether future splits could be in order for these top tech names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Inc company logo displayed on mobile phone screen. AVGO stock\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors continue to anticipate gains from Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) recent 10-for-1 split. A Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysis shows stocks typically rise 25.4% within a year of a split, versus 11.9% for the S&P 500. On that mathematical basis alone, there\u2019s a thesis behind buying this stock right now.\n\nCiti (NYSE:C) analysts recently noted Broadcom\u2019s rising momentum, citing growing investor interest due to its expanding AI clientele and VMware acquisition. While Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) clearly remains the favored player in this sector, investor fatigue with other mega-cap chip names appears to be boosting Broadcom\u2019s appeal.\n\nAt the time of writing, AVGO stock trades just above $150 per share, with a market cap of $705 billion. Market analysts continue to praise Broadcom for its leadership in the semiconductor industry and infrastructure software and commended its strategic product portfolio. So, could AVGO be among the next stocks to hit a $1 trillion valuation, given it\u2019s within a 50% move of hitting this target.\n\nCurrently well-positioned for more growth, AVGO stock is seeing strong growth courtesy of its AI and cloud computing exposure. The company\u2019s strong R&D investments and recurring revenue from infrastructure software support a solid business model. Additionally, Broadcom\u2019s recent VMware acquisition is expected to boost growth by integrating key AI tools. Broadcom\u2019s strategy to lead in critical markets with high switching costs supports a positive long-term investment outlook.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is another key beneficiary of the recent AI boom. Once a niche player, its liquid-cooling technology now supports 30% of data center operations. Recently, SMCI achieved $3 billion in quarterly revenue, higher than its 2021 annual total, reflecting record demand for its solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts predict the AI market will surge from $200 billion to over $1 trillion by 2030, boosting Super Micro Computer\u2019s prospects. Unlike Nvidia, which relies on new product releases for revenue, SMCI benefits by integrating new chips from major manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) into its products. This path has driven the firm\u2019s growth to five times the industry average. As AI advances and new chips launch, Super, Micro Computer\u2019s diversified strategy positions it for continued success, independent of any single chipmaker\u2019s performance.\n\nBenefiting from AI growth, Super Micro Computer may offer better long-term returns than Nvidia. With a forward price-earnings ratio of 24-times versus Nvidia\u2019s 43-times, it\u2019s a promising, undervalued AI investment.\n\nPalo Alto Network (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a top cybersecurity stock which has surged 350% in the past 5 years. The company\u2019s Q1 results were impressive, with earnings per share coming in at $1.32 and revenue reaching $1.98 billion. As interest rates decline, the company anticipates increased cybersecurity spending.\n\nDriven Technologies earned Palo Alto Networks\u2019 NextWave Diamond Innovator status, joining a select group of top channel partners. This recognition highlights Driven Technologies\u2019 extensive cybersecurity solutions, including AI-managed services. Its Chief Executive Officer Rudy Casasola emphasized that this status affirms their team\u2019s industry-leading expertise and use of Palo Alto Networks\u2019 advanced tools.\n\nIn the cybersecurity sector and a market full of start-ups, Palo Alto Network has made a notable shift in consolidating the sector with tight competition. PANW CEO Nikesh Aurora notes that since he took over in 2018, the company has emerged as a platform that offers integrated solutions for a more secure access service edge. Thus, for those bullish on the cybersecurity space, this remains a top pick worth considering on dips moving forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nancy Pelosi Vs. Kamala Harris: Poll Shows Who People Think Is the Better Investor\n\nThe investing portfolios of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris may differ, with a preference of individual stocks versus exchange traded funds.\n\nWhat Happened: With President Joe Biden dropping out of the 2024 election, Harris is the favorite to secure the Democratic Party nomination and has received endorsements from many people, including Pelosi.\n\nWhile they are both Democrats and key political figures, Harris and Pelosi differ when it comes to investing.\n\nPelosi and her venture capitalist husband Paul Pelosi prefer to buy individual stocks and options, often in the technology sector. Compare that to the investment style of Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, who have their money parked in mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\n\nBenzinga recently polled readers to see which investment style could be better.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' investments include mutual funds and S&P 500 holdings, while Nancy Pelosi and her husband have purchased stocks like Nvidia, Apple and Tesla. Who do you think is a better investor?\" Benzinga asked.\n\nThe results were:\n\nKamala Harris: 34% Nancy Pelosi: 66%\n\nThe Benzinga Government trades page for Pelosi shows recent purchases of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nAccording to a report from Barrons, Harris and Emhoff have between $2.9 million and $6.6 million in investments and cash based on financial disclosures. Among the investments include Harris having between $250,000 and $500,000 in a Target Date 2030 fund and between $100,000 and $250,000 in an S&P fund and large-cap growth fund.\n\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\nEmhoff has investments in several ETFs, including the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (BATS:IEFA).\n\nA Quiver Quant report shows the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSE:VUG) and the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSE:VTV) as two of the largest holdings by the vice president and first gentleman. The Vanguard Growth ETF is heavily weighting in technology stocks, making up 60% of the ETF.\n\nOne thing the two political figures have in common with their investments is a preference to large cap stocks and not having large weightings of small cap stocks in their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Also: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\n\nWhy It's Important: The net worth of Harris and Emhoff pales in comparison to her 2024 election opponent Donald Trump, who is a billionaire thanks to his investments and large stake in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT).\n\n\"Does the difference in wealth between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make her a more or less appealing candidate?\" Benzinga asked.\n\nThe results were:\n\nMore appealing: 32% Less appealing: 4% Makes no difference to me: 64%\n\nThe poll found that potential voters don't care too much that Trump is worth significantly more than Harris. A larger amount of respondents said Harris is more appealing than less appealing based on her lower wealth amount.\n\nTrending:If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nBenzinga also asked if people were surprised by the $2.9 million to $6.6 million figure that is being reported for Harris and her husband's wealth.\n\nThe results were:\n\nMore than I expected: 29% Less than I expected: 34% About what I expected: 37%\n\nThe poll results were close, with the majority of respondents indicating that Harris\u2019s wealth was in line with their expectations. Additionally, about one-third of the respondents felt that the amount was less than they anticipated.\n\nDisclosures of investments for political figures has been a hot topic in recent years, with calls to ban members of Congress from trading stocks and options. The significant allocation to ETFs and mutual funds indicates that Harris has not been actively buying and trading individual stocks like some members of Congress and their spouses.\n\nHarris and Pelosi may have investment commonalities of preference for technology and large-cap stocks, while both also mostly avoid small-cap stocks.\n\nInterested in learning more about small-cap stocks and ETFs?

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: CrowdStrike vs. Palo Alto Networks",
        "content": "Organizations around the world depend on cybersecurity to protect against hackers. The extent of that dependency became apparent on July 19 when a software update made by cybersecurity company CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) contained an error, causing widespread disruption across many businesses, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nThis unexpected incident prompted CrowdStrike shares to plummet 11% on the day of the outage. Since then, the stock has continued to drop, falling below $270 at the time of this writing, well off its 52-week high of $398 on July 9. Is this dip an opportunity to pick up the stock?\n\nOr is it better to buy shares in a CrowdStrike rival, such as Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW)? The stock's price has risen in the wake of CrowdStrike's botched software update. Let's compare these two cybersecurity companies to decide which is the better investment.\n\nEvaluating CrowdStrike\n\nWhile CrowdStrike's July 19 outage is an embarrassment for the company right now, what matters more to an investment decision is how the company can perform over the long haul. Based on its results so far this year, a case can be made for investors with a long-term view to take advantage of the stock's current price crash and buy.\n\nOne reason is CrowdStrike's outsize revenue growth. In its fiscal first quarter, ended April 30, the company delivered $921 million in sales, a 33% year-over-year increase.\n\nA factor in CrowdStrike's rising revenue has been customers adopting multiple cybersecurity solutions from the company. Its software platform offers various add-ons beyond basic monitoring, such as asking its security personnel to proactively hunt for cyber threats. In the first quarter, 65% of customers adopted five or more of these additional options, and deals involving eight or more add-ons grew 95% year over year.\n\nAlong with impressive sales growth, CrowdStrike's financials are strong. The company achieved a record free cash flow (FCF) of $322 million in its fiscal Q1, a 42% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe company exited Q1 with an excellent balance sheet. Total assets were $6.8 billion with cash and equivalents alone comprising $3.7 billion.\n\nTotal liabilities were $4.3 billion, and of that amount, deferred revenue accounted for $3.1 billion. This deferred revenue represents payments received from customers that will eventually be recognized as income once CrowdStrike fulfills its contract obligations.\n\nThe case for Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile CrowdStrike's performance to date has been healthy, the same is true of rival Palo Alto Networks. In its fiscal third quarter, ended April 30, Palo Alto Networks saw revenue rise 15% year over year to $2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, it generated fiscal third-quarter FCF of $492 million, up from the prior year's $401 million. Its balance sheet at the end of Q3 was exceptional with $17.9 billion in total assets, and cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion. Total liabilities were $13.5 billion with $10.2 billion of that in deferred revenue.\n\nAs part of a plan to grow its business, the company introduced a new strategy this year. The plan encourages customers to consolidate their cybersecurity spending from multiple vendors to Palo Alto Networks. So far, the results suggest the strategy is working.\n\nIn its fiscal third quarter, the number of accounts spending more than $1 million with the company increased 22% year over year, while those spending greater than $10 million rose 28% year over year.\n\nCEO Nikesh Arora highlighted how one business unhappy with its existing cybersecurity vendor opted for Palo Alto Networks because of its \"ability to deliver consolidated capabilities through a platform across half a dozen areas.\"\n\nChoosing between CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks\n\nBoth CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks have delivered impressive performances this year, so another factor to consider when deciding between these two stocks is valuation. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a commonly used metric for this. PANW PE Ratio Chart\n\nCrowdStrike's P/E ratio is about 10x higher than Palo Alto Networks', even after its share price dropped due to the July 19 outage. This indicates Palo Alto Networks' stock is a better value.\n\nCombining valuation with its strong performance in fiscal 2024 makes Palo Alto Networks stock a compelling investment. Adding to this is that the long-term fallout from CrowdStrike's bungled software update is unclear at this time.\n\nAs a result of the July 19 outage, some Wall Street analysts downgraded CrowdStrike stock. For instance, Guggenheim's John DiFucci stated, \"There likely will be negative effects on its business due to the disorder across the world that CrowdStrike has caused, even if temporary.\"\n\nDiFucci has a point. In fact, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he halted the use of CrowdStrike after its software issue arose.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, at this time, the better stock to buy in this contest of cybersecurity titans is Palo Alto Networks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Intuitive Surgical and Hooker Furnishings have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 25, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG as the Bull of the Day and Hooker Furnishings Corp. HOFT as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on CrowdStrike CRWD, Microsoft MSFT and Palo Alto Networks PANW.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nIntuitive Surgical, Inc. is back to its winning ways as da Vinci procedures continue to grow worldwide. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to see 14% revenue growth in 2024 and 16% in 2025.\r\n\r\nIntuitive Surgical manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system globally. It strives to make surgery more effective, less invasive and easier on surgeons, patients and their families. As of June 30, 2024, its da Vinci surgical system installed base grew to 9,203 systems.\r\n\r\nAnother Earnings Beat in the Second Quarter\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2024, Intuitive Surgical reported second quarter 2024 results and beat on the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.25. Earnings were $1.78 versus the consensus of $1.53.\r\n\r\nIt was the 6th earnings beat in a row.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic was a difficult time for the company as surgical procedures plunged worldwide. But that impact has receded.\r\n\r\nWorldwide da Vinci procedures grew 17% year-over-year in the second quarter. It placed 341 da Vinci surgical systems, up from 331 last year.\r\n\r\nRevenue rose 14% to $2.01 billion from $1.76 billion last year driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume and an increase in the installed base of systems.\r\n\r\nThe Company finished the second quarter with $7.68 billion in cash, up $360 million.\r\n\r\nAnalysts Bullish on 2024 and 2025\r\n\r\nNo surprise that the analysts are bullish on Intuitive Surgical. 10 estimates were revised higher in the last week for both 2024 and 2025.\r\n\r\nThe 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to $6.62 from $6.26. That is earnings growth of 16% from 2023 as the company made $5.71 last year.\r\n\r\nThey are bullish on 2025 as well. 10 estimates were also revised higher for 2025 in the last week. The Zacks Consensus rose to $7.60 from $7.32, or another 14.8% earnings growth.\r\n\r\nHere's what this strong earnings growth looks like on the price and consensus chart.\n\nShares at All-Time Highs\r\n\r\nIntuitive Surgical went IPO in 2000. The stock has been one of the top performers over the last 24 years and recently hit new all-time highs.\n\nIt's not a value stock. Intuitive Surgical trades at 68x earnings.\r\n\r\nBut for investors looking for growth, Intuitive Surgical, with its double digit revenue and earnings growth, should be on your short list.\n\nStory continues\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nHooker Furnishings Corp. continues to focus on execution during this sustained downturn in the furniture industry. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see a big decrease in earnings in fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nHooker Furnishings is celebrating its 100th year of business this year. It is a designer, marketer and importer of casegoods (wooden and metal furniture), leather furniture, fabric-upholstered furniture, lighting, accessories and home decor for the residential, hospitality and contract markets.\r\n\r\nThe company's corporate offices and manufacturing facilities are located in Virginia, North Carolina and California. It has showrooms in High Point, NC, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It also operates distribution centers in Virginia, Georgia and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nHooker Furnishings also sells online.\r\n\r\nA Big Miss in the First Quarter of Fiscal 2025\r\n\r\nOn June 6, 2024, Hooker Furnishings reported its fiscal 2025 first quarter results and missed on the Zacks Consensus by $0.36. Earnings were a loss of $0.39 versus the consensus of a loss of $0.03.\r\n\r\nIt was the second miss in a row.\r\n\r\nNet sales fell 23.2% to $93.6 million year-over-year. All three of its reporting segments experienced a decline in sales driven mostly by the continued weak demand for home furnishings.\r\n\r\nYear-over-year, industry-wide US furniture store sales fell compared to the prior year same months for the 14th consecutive month.\r\n\r\nBalance Sheet and Dividend\r\n\r\nThe company is focused on maintaining a healthy financial position and balance sheet while the downturn in the industry continues. After all, Hooker didn't get to 100 years in business without navigating challenging economic conditions.\r\n\r\nIt has $41 million in cash on hand and inventory levels are well-aligned to current demand. They have actually come down $5.2 million to $56.6 million compared to $61.8 million three months prior, which was at the end of the fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\"Given the uncertainty in the furniture industry and the general economy, we remain committed to our capital allocation policy. Our short-term capital allocation strategy is focused on preserving capital until we begin to see an industry-turnaround, while also protecting our 50-plus year history of quarterly dividends and continuing to invest in organic growth,\" said Chief Financial Officer, Paul Huckfeldt.\r\n\r\n\"We believe we have a conservative balance sheet, which can help us weather the current demand environment\", he continued, \"but understand the need for caution in a cyclical industry like ours,\" he added.\r\n\r\nEarnings Estimates Were Cut\r\n\r\nGiven the tough industry conditions, it's not a surprise that the earnings estimates have been cut.\r\n\r\nOne estimate was cut for fiscal 2025 in the last 60 days but it took the Zacks Consensus down to $0.09 from $1.10. That's a decline of 90.1% as Hooker made $0.91 last year.\r\n\r\nShares Near 5-Year Lows\r\n\r\nShares of Hooker soared during the pandemic as furniture sales also soared. But the party ended in 2021 and the stock has struggled.\r\n\r\nIt's trading near 5-year lows.\r\n\r\nBut is it cheap?\r\n\r\nWith the cutting of earnings estimates, Hooker still has a high forward P/E of 171.\r\n\r\nThe company is committed to its dividend, however. That is yielding 5.96%.\r\n\r\nBut investors might want to wait for the furniture industry to see some green shoots before jumping in on Hooker Furnishings.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nIs CrowdStrike a Buy Here?\n\nCrowdStrike, a leader in next-generation endpoint protection, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response services, has been at the forefront of headlines following a global IT outage that halted many aspects of the economy and affected many Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nIt's been a rough few days for the stock, reflective of the incident. But is the move a buying opportunity, or should investors stay on the sidelines until we learn more? Let's take a closer look.\n\nCrowdStrike Plunges\n\nThe recent move has pushed valuation multiples down, with shares currently trading at a 14.3X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio compared to a 23.8X high just this year. The company is forecasted to see 30% sales growth in its current fiscal year, though it's critical to note that these expectations will likely be adjusted following the fiasco.\n\nIn addition, Guggenheim Securities, BTIG, and Scotiabank all downgraded their ratings for the stock from 'Strong Buy' to 'Hold' just this week, again reflecting the potential negative ramifications.\n\nMicrosoft released a statement following the incident, stating, 'While software updates may occasionally cause disturbances, significant incidents like the CrowdStrike event are infrequent. We currently estimate that CrowdStrike's update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.'\n\nWhile the recent dip is certainly appetizing, given the company's established nature and pure size, investors should wait on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. In addition, its current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating alludes to further near-term share pressure.\n\nCompetition Looks to Pounce\n\nGiven the recent development, several cybersecurity stocks could see some beneficial tailwinds, such as Palo Alto Networks. The company's current year outlook has remained bullish, with the $5.57 per share expected up 12% over the last year.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' sales growth is also expected to remain strong, forecasted to jump 16% in its current fiscal year. The stock has remained on a strong growth trajectory, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in each of its last ten quarterly releases.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe recent CrowdStrike fiasco that brought down Microsoft devices has certainly brought about some headwinds for the stock, plunging following the incident.\n\nWhile the rough price action could be seen as a buying opportunity among some, the company's cloudy earnings outlook, reflected by its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) alludes to further share pressure in the near term. Instead, investors should pivot to stocks enjoying positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nFurther, we could be in the early stages of the incident, with the overall impact not yet fully understood. A rival, Palo Alto Networks, could see buying pressure given its competitive nature with CrowdStrike.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u2019\n\nWhile the recent dip is certainly appetizing, given the company\u2019s established nature and pure size, investors should wait on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. In addition, its current Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating alludes to further near-term share pressure.\n\nCompetition Looks to Pounce\n\nGiven the recent development, several cybersecurity stocks could see some beneficial tailwinds, such as Palo Alto Networks PANW. The company\u2019s current year outlook has remained bullish, with the $5.57 per share expected up 12% over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 sales growth is also expected to remain strong, forecasted to jump 16% in its current fiscal year. The stock has remained on a strong growth trajectory, posting double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth rates in each of its last ten quarterly releases.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe recent CrowdStrike CRWD fiasco that brought down Microsoft MSFT devices has certainly brought about some headwinds for the stock, plunging following the incident.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the rough price action could be seen as a buying opportunity among some, the company\u2019s cloudy earnings outlook, reflected by its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) alludes to further share pressure in the near term. Instead, investors should pivot to stocks enjoying positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nFurther, we could be in the early stages of the incident, with the overall impact not yet fully understood. A rival, Palo Alto Networks PANW, could see buying pressure given its competitive nature with CrowdStrike.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Might Have The Makings Of A Multi-Bagger",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Palo Alto Networks, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.081 = US$880m \u00f7 (US$18b - US$7.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024).\n\nThus, Palo Alto Networks has an ROCE of 8.1%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 7.6%, it's still a low return by itself.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Palo Alto Networks' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Palo Alto Networks .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For Palo Alto Networks Tell Us?\n\nWe're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 8.1%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 154%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Palo Alto Networks can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 342% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Palo Alto Networks can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted  3 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks  (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) that you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "title": "Forget CrowdStrike: 3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) stock price tumbled 11% on July 19 after the cybersecurity company's flawed software update for Windows PCs sparked a global IT outage across banks, airports, hospitals, government agencies, retailers, and other businesses. The company says it's already identified the issue and is in the process of rolling back the disastrous update, but it's still too early to assess the long-term damage to its business and brand.\n\nThis seems like a black swan event for CrowdStrike, one of the cybersecurity sector's fastest-growing companies. Its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its stock surged 265% over the past five years, and it now serves about 60% of the Fortune 500 companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike should eventually recover and keep growing as its cloud-native endpoint security platform replaces more on-site appliances. But its stock isn't cheap at 19 times this year's sales, and analysts will likely rein in their near-term forecasts. So instead of wondering if CrowdStrike can right its ship without hitting another iceberg, you might instead consider investing in three of its peers: Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), and SentinelOne(NYSE: S).\n\n1. Zscaler\n\nZscaler, like CrowdStrike, is a cloud-native cybersecurity company that doesn't install any on-site appliances. But instead of offering a wide range of security services like CrowdStrike, Zscaler mainly provides \"zero-trust\" services that treat everyone as a potential threat. That approach can stop internal threats like corporate spies and disgruntled employees. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global zero-trust market could still grow at a CAGR of 17% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nZscaler went public in 2018, and its revenue rose at a CAGR of 52% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last July). Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also grew at a CAGR of 70%.\n\nLike many of its peers, Zscaler has been struggling with slower growth as the macro headwinds made it harder to acquire new customers. But from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts still expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 26% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 40%. Based on those expectations, its stock doesn't look that expensive at 13 times this year's sales and 56 times its adjusted EBITDA.\n\n2. SentinelOne\n\nSentinelOne aims to disrupt the cybersecurity market with its Singularity extended detection and response (XDR) platform. The company claims Singularity's AI algorithms can completely replace teams of human analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's a bold claim, but SentinelOne has grown like a weed since its public debut in 2021. From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a CAGR of 74%. However, its stock has declined nearly 40% below its initial public offering (IPO) price of $35 as the macro and competitive headwinds throttled its near-term growth.\n\nAnalysts still expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 27% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027 as the macro environment warms up and it expands Singularity's ecosystem. They also expect its adjusted EBITDA to finally turn positive in fiscal 2026. SentinelOne is still a speculative play, but it looks reasonably valued at 7 times this year's sales.\n\n3. Palo Alto Networks\n\nPalo Alto Networks started out as a provider of next-gen firewalls, which added more network filters to traditional firewalls. Today, those on-site firewalls serve as the foundation of its Strata network security platform. However, Palo Alto also provides cloud-based services through its Prisma platform along with AI-powered threat detection tools on its Cortex platform. Most of its growth has been driven by Prisma and Cortex, which it refers to collectively as its \"next-gen security\" (NGS) services.\n\nPalo Alto went public in 2012, and its revenue grew at a CAGR of 35% from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2023 (which ended in July 2023). It now serves more than 80,000 enterprise customers as one of the largest cybersecurity companies in the world. Its growth also slowed down as it faced tougher macro challenges over the past year, but that deceleration was exacerbated by a \"platformization strategy\" driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals for some of its newer services.\n\nBut from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts still expect Palo Alto's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 16% as its earnings per share rises at a CAGR of 49% on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. It might seem a bit pricey at more than 50 times its forward adjusted earnings, but its scale, diversification, and rising profits arguably justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Super Stocks You'll Wish You'd Bought Today if She's Right",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is the CEO of Ark Investment Management, which operates several private and exchange-traded funds focused on innovative technology stocks. Last year, Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, predicting they will eventually generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nWood has piled money into several AI opportunities since making that call. The Ark Venture Fund recently bought stakes in private entities like ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Anthropic. Also, Ark's ETFs have been net buyers of several AI stocks this year, including Tesla, UiPath, and Palantir Technologies.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, there could be an exciting list of winners over the long term. Here's why Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) and Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) might be two of the biggest.\n\n1. Datadog: A picks-and-shovels AI play\n\nIf you owned a retail store 20 years ago, you would rely on a sales attendant to determine customer satisfaction. In the world of online shopping, where customers are often faceless, determining their satisfaction is much harder. Datadog's cloud platform is designed to monitor digital infrastructure around the clock, instantly alerting managers to technical glitches so they can be patched before negatively impacting the customer experience.\n\nDatadog has 28,000 clients across retail, entertainment, healthcare, financial services, and more. Simply put, any business with a digital presence -- whether customer-facing or not -- can benefit from Datadog's cloud-monitoring technology to find the root cause of technical issues immediately, which translates into less downtime.\n\nLast year, Datadog decided to apply its expertise to the AI industry. Its new large language model (LLM) monitoring platform helps developers quickly diagnose problems, improve performance by tracking the quality of chatbot responses, and even manage costs by monitoring consumption. It could become an essential tool for any business developing AI in the same way that monitoring tools are used by many companies that rely on the cloud.\n\nDatadog also offers a monitoring tool for developers using ready-made LLMs from OpenAI. Datadog's tools can track OpenAI usage across an entire organization, so managers can see which departments are responsible for the most consumption. That helps them control costs and computing workloads to maintain optimum performance.\n\nDatadog expects to generate $2.6 billion in total revenue during 2024. As of the first quarter (ended March 31), around 3.5% of the company's revenue was coming from AI customers, which was up from 3% just three months earlier. That number could top 5% by the end of the year if the current rate of growth persists, meaning Datadog could bring in $130 million in revenue from AI alone.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat number might sound small, but keep in mind it was practically zero in Q1 2023. It's feasible to see AI becoming a substantial contributor to Datadog's financial results within the next five years as more companies adopt AI and require monitoring tools to protect their investment in the technology. As a result, Datadog stock is a great way to play the AI software boom Cathie Wood anticipates.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks: A leader in AI-powered cybersecurity\n\nCybersecurity is front-of-mind for many corporate executives at the moment, especially after last week's global IT outage caused by popular provider CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is Palo Alto's largest competitor, so this might be an opportunity to win some contracts from dissatisfied customers.\n\nPalo Alto operates three platforms: cloud security, network security, and security operations. The company is in the process of weaving AI into each one to help customers deal with modern-day threats. Palo Alto says 93% of organizations still rely on human-led processes in their security operations centers, and 23% of incidents are left uninvestigated because managers can't handle the sheer volume of incoming threats.\n\nPalo Alto's Cortex XSIAM product introduces AI-powered automation into the security operations center. One customer -- Imagine Technologies -- now closes 100% of its security incidents using automation, up from less than 10% before adopting XSIAM. Boyne Resorts is experiencing similar success, reducing the time it takes to resolve incidents by a whopping 98%, from three days to just 1.7 hours.\n\nIn the past, businesses would piece together their cybersecurity stack from different providers, because there wasn't a true one-vendor solution. Palo Alto is trying to change that because customers who adopt all three of its platforms (representing a full solution) have a lifetime value 40 times greater than clients who use just one. To entice customers to shift all of their spending to Palo Alto, the company is offering fee-free periods to help them see out their existing contracts with other vendors.\n\nThat will impact Palo Alto's revenue growth in the short term, but it could lead to a significant payoff in the future. The company expects to generate $4 billion in revenue from \"platformization\" customers in fiscal 2024 (ending July 31), but it plans to more than triple that number to $15 billion per year by 2030.\n\nTherefore, Palo Alto could be one of the best AI software stocks investors can buy if Cathie Wood's prediction proves to be right. It's one of only a few companies successfully monetizing AI already, and it has a clear plan to generate significant financial growth over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Datadog right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Datadog, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Datadog wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike's Big Blunder a Buying Opportunity?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) stock price plunged 11% on Friday, July 19, after an update to its cloud-based cybersecurity platform sparked a global IT outage across banks, airports, hospitals, retailers, other businesses, and government agencies. ATMs stopped working, flights were delayed, and crucial healthcare services went offline.\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the incident was caused by a \"defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\" and that a fix had already \"been deployed.\" Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which was initially blamed for the outage because it only occurred on Windows systems, said it was working with CrowdStrike to resolve those issues.\n\nCrowdStrike certainly made a massive mistake and the market's reaction is understandable. But others are wondering if this news-driven pullback represents a good buying opportunity. Are they right? Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy did CrowdStrike's outage cause so much damage?\n\nIn the past, most cybersecurity companies installed on-site appliances to run their services. But that hardware was expensive, sucked up power, took up a lot of space, and required constant maintenance.\n\nCrowdStrike addressed those issues with Falcon, a cloud-native endpoint security platform that didn't require any on-site appliances. As a cloud-based platform, Falcon was easier to install, scale, and update than appliance-based platforms. It also enabled CrowdStrike to lock clients into sticky recurring subscriptions and cross-sell more cloud-based modules to grow its revenue per customer.\n\nThose strengths have enabled CrowdStrike to grow like a weed since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65%, from $250 million to $3.06 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike now serves 298 of the Fortune 500 companies and 538 of the Fortune 1000 companies. However, that widespread adoption explains why CrowdStrike's flawed update caused so much damage in such a short time.\n\nHow fast was CrowdStrike growing?\n\nOver the past year, as macro headwinds forced many companies to rein in their spending, CrowdStrike's growth in both ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) and total revenue decelerated. But its net new ARR growth rose by double-digit percentages year over year again over the past three quarters -- which meant it was still gaining new customers in a challenging market.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = year over year. Note: Ending ARR is the sum of preexisting ARR with net new ARR.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike attributed that robust growth to its market-share gains, new government contracts, and the rollout of more generative artificial intelligence (AI) features for Falcon. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% a year earlier.\n\nDuring the first-quarter conference call, Kurtz notably took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) new platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- saying \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\" Unfortunately, CrowdStrike's recent software blunder might just drive some companies to try out Palo Alto's more diversified mix of on-site and cloud-based services instead.\n\nAt the time, CrowdStrike expected its revenue to grow 30%-31% in fiscal 2025. It also planned to continue its five-quarter streak of profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But given those estimates (which will likely be reduced) and its current enterprise value of $67.5 billion, it still looks expensive at 17 times this year's sales.\n\nWill this outage impact CrowdStrike's long-term growth?\n\nThe big question now is how much this fiasco will throttle CrowdStrike's long-term growth. Bulls will argue that the company's leadership of the cloud-native cybersecurity space, its sticky cloud-based ecosystem, and the high costs of switching to another platform will prevent it from losing too many customers in the aftermath of the IT outage.\n\nHowever, Kurtz admitted it would take \"some time\" before the problem update was rolled back and all of the affected systems were fully restored. CrowdStrike could also be hit by plenty of lawsuits after this debacle, and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk said his company had already \"deleted CrowdStrike\" from all of its systems.\n\nThe incident also made CrowdStrike, which hadn't been widely recognized outside of tech and business circles, a household name in the worst possible way. Warren Buffett once said it \"takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it\" -- and the damage to CrowdStrike's brand could certainly erode its defenses against its eager competitors.\n\nMicrosoft has been quietly expanding its own cloud-based cybersecurity platform over the past few years, with big investments and acquisitions. This embarrassing incident could drive Microsoft to accelerate the development of those internal services, in order to curb its dependence on CrowdStrike and other third-party cybersecurity platforms.\n\nSo is CrowdStrike's pullback a buying opportunity?\n\nI own shares of CrowdStrike, but I think it would need to pull back even further before it's considered a bargain. It's still up more than 90% over the past 12 months and isn't cheap -- and we can't yet gauge the long-term impact of this disastrous outage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is It Time To Consider Buying Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Palo Alto Networks\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Still Cheap?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 9.06% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Palo Alto Networks today, you\u2019d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $296.98, there\u2019s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Palo Alto Networks\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from Palo Alto Networks? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Palo Alto Networks, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn\u2019t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? PANW seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on PANW for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there\u2019s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven\u2019t considered today, which can help gel your views on PANW should the price fluctuate below its true value.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Palo Alto Networks, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Grow Your Wealth",
        "content": "Cybersecurity remains an important and growing area of technology. Cyber threats and attacks are only growing as the world becomes more wired and interconnected. The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. has pegged the market opportunity for cybersecurity technology and service providers at $2 trillion. As a result, cybersecurity stocks are on the rise.\n\nFor corporations, cybersecurity is becoming an increasingly important cost of doing business. One need only look at the chaos caused at UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), the largest health insurer in the United States, after a cyberattack took down its technology unit Change Healthcare. The attack disrupted UnitedHealth\u2019s payment system and forced it to provide $9 billion worth of loans to some partners. The company is forecasting a hit to its earnings this year of $2.05 per share.\n\nHere are three cybersecurity stocks that could grow your wealth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is recovering after suffering a big dip in this year\u2019s first quarter. Year-to-date, PANW stock is up 15% and things look encouraging after the company\u2019s first-quarter financial results. Long-term Palo Alto Networks remains one of the best cybersecurity stocks to own, having risen nearly 350% over the last five years. After dropping due to a decline in quarterly billings, PANW stock has recovered after its Q1 profit and sales figures beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported Q1 EPS of $1.32, which beat estimates of $1.25 per share. Revenue came in at $1.98 billion, which topped analyst expectations of $1.97 billion. The company\u2019s sales were up 15% from a year earlier. While corporate spending on cybersecurity has dipped over the past year due to inflation and an uncertain economic environment, Palo Alto Networks sees that changing as interest rates move lower in the coming months.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is having a very good year. Not only is CRWD stock up 45% since January, but it was added to the benchmark S&P 500 index on June 24, giving its share price a further boost as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 are required to buy it. Over five years, CrowdStrike stock has risen nearly 330%, making it another long-term winner.\n\nCrowdStrike stock popped 7% after the cybersecurity firm recently reported Q1 financial results that beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. The company reported EPS of 93 cents, which was above the 89 cents expected among analysts who track the company\u2019s progress. Revenue amounted to $921 million, up 34% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street estimates of $905 million. Subscription revenue, an important metric for the company, grew 34% to $872.2 million in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG/NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of search engine Google, is pushing aggressively into the cybersecurity space. Media reports say that Alphabet is circling cybersecurity firm Wiz in what could be a $23 billion acquisition, the biggest deal ever for the tech giant. Wiz provides cybersecurity for cloud-computing platforms and services.\n\nWhile purchasing Wiz would be Alphabet\u2019s biggest deal ever, it would not be Alphabet\u2019s first cybersecurity purchase. In 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion. Alphabet executives have said that growing their cybersecurity offerings is a key focus of the technology giant. Alphabet recognizes the growing importance of cybersecurity, particularly for its Google Cloud unit and internet-connected smart home devices. GOOGL stock is up 30% year-to-date and has gained 220% over five years.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years. He spent five years as a staff reporter at The Wall Street Journal, and has also written for The Washington Post and Toronto Star newspapers, as well as financial websites such as The Motley Fool and Investopedia.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "content": "Block upgraded, PayPal downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\n\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nWilliam Blair upgraded Block (SQ) to Outperform from Market Perform without a price target. The firm says its bullish view reflects Square's improving execution, marked by simpler merchant onboarding and new vertical solutions, such as in hospitality, and CEO Jack Dorsey \"injecting new energy into a business that had become complacent, despite technology leadership.\" TD Cowen upgraded Fortinet (FTNT) to Buy from Hold with an unchanged price target of $75. The firm cites the firm's \"solid\" channel checks, which suggest a bottoming cycle for security appliances, for the upgrade. Citi upgraded VF Corp. (VFC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $20, up from $11. The announcement of the sale of Supreme for $1.5B, more than Citi expected, has cleared the way for the company to repay both of their upcoming debt maturities, the firm tells investors in a research note. Baird upgraded e.l.f. Beauty(ELF) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $230, up from $210. With \"healthy\" brand momentum, ongoing distribution expansion, and significant international whitespace, e.l.f. is positioned to sustain market share gains and \"premium\" earnings growth even in a choppier consumer backdrop, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley upgraded Gap (GPS) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $29, up from $27. The firm cites positive indicators from its retail scorecard analysis, incremental confidence in new management's strategy execution following the Q1 print and June meetings, room for positive earnings revisions in 2024 and beyond, and potential for a \"temporary valuation re-rating\" for the upgrade.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nWilliam Blair downgraded PayPal (PYPL) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target. The firm sees potential upside to 2024 and 2025 earnings estimates, but does not anticipate the stock's multiple will appreciably rise in the absence of accelerating payment volume growth or expanding transaction dollar margin. Redburn Atlantic downgraded Palo Alto Networks(PANW) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $325, down from $350. While near-term expectations have been reset after the announcement of Palo Alto's \"platformisation\" strategy, consensus expects a sharp reacceleration in dollar growth from fiscal 2026 onwards, which is unlikely, the firm tells investors in a research note. Morgan Stanley downgraded Foot Locker(FL) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $18, down from $24. The firm cites negative indicators in its scorecard analysis, continued fear of negative earnings revision risk both near- and long-term and risk of valuation de-rating for the downgrade. Redburn Atlantic double downgraded Crowdstrike (CRWD) to Sell from Buy with a price target of $275, down from $380. The stock's valuation is \"demanding\" and any disappointment to sales or annual recurring revenue could bring a sharp de-rating, the firm tells investors in a research note, adding that it sees downside risk to current buy-side expectations. Barclays downgraded Molson Coors(TAP) to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $47, down from $55. The firm believes a challenging industry backdrop will weigh on Molson's results \"for some time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nMacquarie initiated coverage of Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) with an Outperform rating and $64 price target. The firm says synergies from the combined company are likely to take longer to fully realize, assuming some consumer cyclicality and weather Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of PagerDuty (PD) with a Neutral rating and $24 price target. The firm believes customers view PagerDuty as more discretionary and sees limited near-term catalysts for the shares. Wells Fargo initiated coverage of Grocery Outlet (GO) with an Overweight rating and $28 price target. The firm says the company's \"choppy\" execution and poor investor sentiment yield an attractive entry point in this \"defensive, growth story.\" Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Impinj (PI) with an Overweight rating and $205 price target. The company is well positioned to capitalize on a large addressable market as radio frequency identification tag usage accelerates in the verticals of retail and general merchandise and supply chain and logistics, the firm tells investors in a research note. Benchmark initiated coverage of Winnebago (WGO) with a Buy rating and $75 price target. As the leading North American manufacturer of RVs and Marine products, the company has historically been known for its motorized RVs, but it has \"undergone a significant transition,\" beginning with its acquisition of Grand Design in 2016, which has been a primary contributor to the company's OEM-leading fundamental profile, the firm notes.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "When it comes to cyber threats, we\u2019re sitting ducks. Our government, cities, major corporations, schools, hospitals, and even millions of individuals are still poorly prepared for more attacks. All of which is creating big opportunities for leading cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAT&T (NYSE:T) just said nearly all of its wireless subscribers\u2019 call and text interactions were exposed in a massive hack in April. Auto dealerships just lost about $1.02 billion in business after the CDK cyberattack.\n\nEven Rite Aid (OTCMKTS:RADCQ) just confirmed it was hacked, with the cybercriminals noting:\u201cWhile having access to the Rite Aid network we obtained over 10 GB of customer information equating to around 45 million lines of people\u2019s personal information.

Now back to $290, I\u2019d again use weakness as an opportunity.\u201d Now up to $343, PANW \u2014 one of the top cybersecurity stocks to own \u2014 is still a strong buy.\n\nHelping, analysts at D.A. Davidson recently initiated a buy rating on the stock, with a price target of $380. Better, Baird has an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $360.\u00a0Plus, earnings have been solid.\n\nIn its third quarter, its earnings per share of $1.23 beat by seven cents. Revenue of $1.98 billion \u2014 up 15.1% year over year \u2014 beat by $10 million.\u00a0Moving forward, the company expects\u00a0fourth-quarter billings to range from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is a year-over-year growth range of 9% to 10%.

At the time, CYBR traded at about $225. Today, it\u2019s up to $275.31 and is still a buy. From $275.31, I\u2019d like to see it test $300 next.\n\nHelping, analysts at Barclays just raised their price target on CYBR to $315 with an outperform rating. \u201cThe analyst thinks security stocks have favorable setups into the Q2 earnings.

        "title": "Buy These 3 Cybersecurity Stocks Following the AT&amp;T Data Breach",
        "content": "It\u2019s about as embarrassing of a situation as a telecommunications firm can find itself in. Recently, AT&T (NYSE:T) revealed that it suffered a major data breach. About the only positive here is for cybersecurity stocks. This sector will likely see a sustained swing higher as data security concerns make headlines once again.\n\nBetween May 1, 2022 and Oct. 31 of that year, \u201cnearly all\u201d of the carrier\u2019s cellular customers had their call records and texts exposed. Fortunately, the breach doesn\u2019t include the content of the calls or texts. Also, the breach does not include sensitive information such as Social Security numbers or date of birth. Still, it\u2019s a major privacy violation.\n\nWhat\u2019s even more ignominious, AT&T had to pay a ransom for about $370,000 \u2013 in cryptocurrencies, of course. This factor too could positively affect cybersecurity stocks. Essentially, hackers are realizing that crime does pay and so they\u2019ll continue engaging in nefarious activities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSadly, the idea of negotiating with hackers in exchange for crypto has become normalized. People and enterprises must protect themselves. With that, below are cybersecurity stocks to consider.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top cybersecurity stocks in the business, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has made a name for itself primarily through its next-generation firewalls. This innovation provides advanced threat protection, intrusion prevention and visibility to operational functionality. Further, Palo Alto provides a range of security products, including endpoint protection and cloud security.\n\nWith the costs of cyberbreaches consistently rising, it\u2019s never been more important for enterprises to seek protection. That\u2019s not just a narrative as Palo Alto has benefited financially from its superior products. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average earnings per share of $1.40. This handily beat the average analyst estimate of $1.25, yielding an earnings surprise of 12.35%.\n\nTo be fair, investors will be paying a premium for the performance. Shares trade hands at 15.3X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s noticeably above the trailing-year average of about 12.8X. Still, the point to consider is the business expansion. In fiscal 2024, sales could rise by 16.1% to $8 billion. And in the following year, revenue may hit $9.11 billion.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top providers of cloud-native endpoint protection, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) offers advanced detection and response capabilities. In particular, its platform integrates multiple functionalities, including threat intelligence and incident responses. As well, CrowdStrike leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and address threats effectively. Not surprisingly, CRWD stock has been on the move, gaining nearly 53% since the start of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, CrowdStrike continues to outperform analysts\u2019 expectations. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of 86 cents. This figure beat out the expected tally of 75 cents. Further, the earnings surprise landed at an impressive 15.83%.\n\nIf there is a drawback to CRWD stock, it\u2019s that everyone apparently loves it. Shares trade hands at 27.82X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s a gargantuan multiple. It\u2019s also much higher than the average multiple of 18.4X seen during the past one-year period.\n\nNevertheless, the upside here is the analyst projections. For fiscal 2025 (calendar 2024), experts believe that sales could hit $4 billion. If so, that would be up 30.8% from the prior year. In fiscal 2026, revenue could clock in at $5.05 billion, up 26.3%. It\u2019s one of the cybersecurity stocks to watch.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) offers a wide range of integrated cybersecurity solutions. These include firewalls, antivirus programs and threat-prevention systems. Notably, its mainline firewall product is one of the industry\u2019s most advanced, delivering a mixture of robust performance and extensive security features. The company also specializes in end-to-end security, presenting a formidable defensive network.\n\nWhile enterprise spending may be a concern for the broader software space, going without adequate cybersecurity protection could be a business liability. Thus, it\u2019s no shock that Fortinet has outperformed analyst expectations. In the past four quarters, Fortinet posted an average EPS of 43 cents, beating out the consensus view of 38 cents. This yielded an earnings surprise of 14.38%.\n\nWhat\u2019s perhaps most attractive about FTNT stock is the valuation. Currently, shares trade hands at 8.64X trailing-year sales. While elevated against the software industry, the market previously priced FTNT (during the past year) at 10.67X.\n\nFurther, experts believe that sales could hit $5.8 billion this year, implying growth of 9.3%. Revenue could rise to $6.54 billion in the following year, making FTNT an attractive wager among cybersecurity stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto\u00a0held a LONG position in T stock.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q1. Today, we are looking at cybersecurity stocks, starting with Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA).\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, but cybersecurity stocks have shown resilience, with share prices up 7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA)\n\nFounded during the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2009, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is a cloud-based software-as-a-service platform that helps companies manage identity for their employees and customers.\n\nOkta reported revenues of $617 million, up 19.1% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 2.1%. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the company with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.\n\n\u201cWe began the new fiscal year with record non-GAAP profitability and cash flow as we continue to benefit from the operating efficiency actions we\u2019ve taken over the past several quarters,\u201d said Todd McKinnon, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Okta. Okta Total Revenue\n\nOkta achieved the highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The stock is up 2.6% since reporting and currently trades at $98.92.\n\nIs now the time to buy Okta? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nAfter successfully selling all four of his previous cybersecurity companies, Jay Chaudhry's fifth venture, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) offers software-as-a-service that helps companies securely connect to applications and networks in the cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nZscaler reported revenues of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 3.2%. It was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates. Zscaler Total Revenue\n\nZscaler pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 31.5% since reporting. It currently trades at $204.49.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q1: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD)\n\nFounded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them.\n\nRapid7 reported revenues of $205.1 million, up 12% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost -64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. As expected, the stock is down 13.4% since the results and currently trades at $39.69.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall, it was an ok quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts' billings estimates but a decline in its gross margin.\n\nThe stock is up 5.5% since reporting and currently trades at $341.96.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Palo Alto Networks here, it's free.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921 million, up 33% year on year, surpassing analysts' expectations by 1.8%.

        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Palo Alto Networks (PANW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PANW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Palo Alto Networks' main business drivers.\n\nSanta Clara, CA-based Palo Alto Networks, Inc. offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company's next generation firewall products deliver natively integrated application, user, and content visibility and control through its operating system, hardware and software architecture. It serves the enterprise network security market, which includes Firewall, Unified Threat Management (UTM), Web Gateway, Intrusion Detection and Prevention, and Virtual Private Network technologies.\r\n\r\nThrough its products and subscription services, Palo Alto provides integrated protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure. Its solutions incorporate application-specific integrated circuits, hardware architecture, operating system, and associated security and networking functions.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s network security gateways protect customer data, reduce security complexities and lower total cost of ownership. Customers can implement their security policies on traffic between internal networks and the Internet, as well as between internal and private networks shared with partners.\r\n\r\nThe company has a single operating segment. However, the company announces its revenues from products and services separately. For fiscal 2023, the company reported total revenues of $6.89 billion, which grew 25.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenues from its products increased 15.8% year over year to $1.58 billion. Revenues from subscriptions and support grew 28.4% to $5.31 billion.\r\n\r\nFurther, Palo Alto operates across different geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APAC).\r\n\r\nThe company faces competition from large companies like Cisco and Juniper, independent security vendors such as Symantec, Check Point, Fortinet, FireEye and several other small companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Palo Alto Networks ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2014 would be worth $13,124.02, or a 1,212.40% gain, as of July 15, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 185.40% and gold's return of 73.25% over the same time frame.\n\nAnalysts are anticipating more upside for PANW.\n\nPalo Alto has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security. PANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\n\nThe stock has jumped 6.05% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 14 higher, for fiscal 2024; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nPalo Alto Networks' estimated fair value is US$297 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$337 suggests Palo Alto Networks is potentially trading close to its fair value Analyst price target for PANW is US$344, which is 16% above our fair value estimate\n\nDoes the July share price for Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$3.44b US$3.99b US$3.42b US$4.50b US$4.74b US$4.96b US$5.15b US$5.33b US$5.49b US$5.65b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x26 Analyst x17 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.45% Est @ 4.53% Est @ 3.88% Est @ 3.43% Est @ 3.12% Est @ 2.90% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%  US$3.2k US$3.5k US$2.8k US$3.4k US$3.4k US$3.3k US$3.2k US$3.1k US$3.0k US$2.9k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$5.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$126b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$126b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$64b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$96b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$337, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Palo Alto Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.996. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nExpensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Palo Alto Networks, there are three additional elements you should further examine:\n\nRisks: For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

        "content": "The apparent winners of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom have been smoking hot of late. While some of the names may be overdue for a correction over the next year, I view many of them as reasonably priced, given the magnitude of growth-powering tailwinds.\n\nIn any case, those seeking to get more bang for their buck should probably check out the names that are not at the front of the AI race. Some of the so-called downstream AI stocks may still be slightly off Wall Street\u2019s radar, but likely not for long, as they look to post solid numbers, thanks primarily to the AI boom.\n\nCheck out three \u201chidden winners\u201d from AI that you may not have considered yet. Though it could take a while before they turn into obvious AI plays like the Magnificent Seven, the potential gains may be worth the wait!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has pretty much shed its reputation as a tech-shy big-box retailer just waiting to get disrupted. Whether it\u2019s the rise of e-commerce or the continued surge in AI technologies, Walmart has done a fantastic job of keeping up with the advanced times.\n\nThough it\u2019s quite a stretch to refer to Walmart as a tech company, I think it\u2019s a mistake to discount the company\u2019s efforts to monetize new technologies, like AI, whether to save money, improve customers\u2019 shopping experiences, or bolster sales. Walmart isn\u2019t just using AI for the positive press; it\u2019s leveraging the technology to unlock monetizable benefits.\n\nThe company is tapping into AI at some of its refrigerated warehouses. These smart AI-equipped warehouses can prevent waste and trim operating costs over the long haul.\n\nIndeed, WMT stock isn\u2019t cheap anymore at 30.3 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), but if you believe in Walmart\u2019s innovation story, the multiple is still too low.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a $110 billion heavyweight in the cybersecurity industry. Cybersecurity solutions have proven rather resilient even amid cutbacks in enterprise IT spending. Like insurance, cutting too deeply into cybersecurity solutions could entail an unfathomable amount of risk. Indeed, cyber breaches are one of those low-probability events that can have a catastrophic impact.\n\nAs generative AI improves at an accelerating pace, AI-powered hackers pose a growing threat to large enterprises. With Precision AI touted in a marketing campaign featuring Keanu Reeves, Palo Alto has a system that effectively leverages machine learning and automation to help clients play chess as hackers play checkers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is one of those AI stocks that should be as obvious as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). In time, I think the cybersecurity titan will be more synonymous with AI.\n\nFinally, once IT spending booms again, PANW stock could be right back to making higher highs.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock has been under pressure since mid-June, now down around 24% from its recent all-time highs. Indeed, the $24.5 billion solar cell innovator took one straight to the chin following the Trump-Biden debate. Political risks aside, First Solar seems like a first pick for investors seeking premier growth in solar power.\n\nThe AI boom, which seems to be getting started, will entail a potentially massive uptick in energy consumption. Utility firms will need to catch up with (hopefully) new renewable projects to be ready for the new AI data centers that will pop up across the globe.\n\nAs First Solar improves its manufacturing efficiency and capacity, FSLR stock seems primed to spike as the number of AI interactions swells over the coming years. If anything, the recent post-debate slump appears like a fantastic opportunity to buy as tech companies open their wallets to power their data centers in the greenest way possible.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Palo Alto Networks (PANW).\n\nPalo Alto currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.58, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.58 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 31 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PANW Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PANW\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Palo Alto here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Palo Alto, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs PANW a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Palo Alto, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $5.57.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Palo Alto. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Palo Alto may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highs And Lows: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q1 cybersecurity earnings season.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and cybersecurity stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 2.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q1: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD)\n\nFounded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them.\n\nRapid7 reported revenues of $205.1 million, up 12% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\n\u201cWe continued to see solid traction with our consolidated threat detection and response solutions during the first quarter\u201d, said Corey Thomas, Chairman and CEO of Rapid7. Rapid7 Total Revenue\n\nRapid7 delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. The company lost -64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. The stock is down 6.3% since reporting and currently trades at $42.94.\n\nRead our full report on Rapid7 here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nAfter successfully selling all four of his previous cybersecurity companies, Jay Chaudhry's fifth venture, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) offers software-as-a-service that helps companies securely connect to applications and networks in the cloud.\n\nZscaler reported revenues of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 3.2%. It was a very strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.\n\nStory continues Zscaler Total Revenue\n\nZscaler achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 30.1% since reporting. It currently trades at $202.25.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS)\n\nFounded in 1999 as one of the first subscription security companies, Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) provides organizations with software to assess their exposure to cyber-attacks.\n\nQualys reported revenues of $145.8 million, up 11.6% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts' billings estimates.\n\nQualys posted the weakest performance against analyst estimates in the group.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW): The \u2018Best of Breed Bison\u2019 AI Stock for the Rest of 2024",
        "content": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. Since Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities in a fresh note said mega-cap tech stocks have a 15% upside in the second half of 2024, driven by AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been beating the AI drum and thinks the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started, wrote that the $4 trillion AI arms race is between major tech players and GPU chips have become the new oil or gold in the tech industry.\n\nIves wrote that he thinks NASDAQ will have another strong second half of the year.\n\n\u201cTech stocks will be up 15% the rest of 2024 in our view with tech fundamentals set to accelerate as AI use cases materially expand.\u201d\n\nWhile Ives continues to see the major tech stocks leading the AI market, he thinks the AI-led rally can broaden out to tech companies who have strong \u201cinstalled\u201d bases which can actually use generative AI applications and models.\n\nLast month, while talking to CNBC, Ives said that the tech bull market is going to last for at least two more years. When asked what could be the threat to this bull run, Ives said that China could be a threat amid a possibility of \u201ctech cold war\u201d but he thinks that is a \u201ccontained threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started off with the semis, but now it\u2019s started to happen is, the demand and the use cases\u201d are expanding to other companies. Ives called the AI boom the \u201cfourth industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nWe picked top AI stocks from Wedbush\u2019s latest note. The firm named some of these stocks as the best picks for the second half of 2024 while called others \u201coversold\u201d tech stocks. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) Best AI Stock for the Second Half of 2024?\n\nPhoto by Jefferson Santos on Unsplash\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PANW)\u00a0is one of the best tech and AI stocks for the rest of 2024 according to Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives.\n\nStrong demand in the cybersecurity industry is boosting Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) across the Street. The stock is up 18% so far this year. Recently, Baird analysts Shrenik Kothari and Zachary Schneider said customers are focused in ROI and increased spending in the industry is benefitting Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cPANW has seen this focus on ROI for some time now. Discounts are offered for larger deals rather than smaller ones to help lock in customers and maximize lifetime value. While still early days, initial customer response to new SASE 3.0 capabilities and AI features has been positive,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThey maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and upped their price target to $360 from $340.\n\nLast month, DA Davidson also started covering the stock with a Buy rating and added it to its \u2018Best of Breed Bison\u2019 category of stocks.\n\nDA Davidson\u2019s Rudy Kessinger thinks Palo Alto Networks Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW)\u00a0three platforms will result in vendor consolidation which would be better than other companies. They believe Palo Alto Networks Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PANW)\u00a0has so far captured only 7% of the market that could reach a whopping $200 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) biggest strength is its Prisma Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) product, which generated about 50% growth in the fiscal third quarter year over year. Another growth catalyst for Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) is Thunderdome Defense Information System Agency\u2019s zero-trust network architecture.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGiven our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in\u00a0Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\n\nOverall, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PANW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Monday, July 8, 2024\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO), Eaton Corporation plc (ETN) and Palo AltoNetworks, Inc. (PANW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\n\nThermo Fisher shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+4.5% vs. +0.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that by utilizing the PPI Business System, by expanding bioproduction purification resin capacity and through introduction of the Axiom PangenomiX Array, Thermo Fisher has been showing strong financial results. Innovation and improvement in patient care and a strong solvency position have also boosted the company\u2019s position.\n\nYet, year-over-year decline in revenues in Life Science Solutions and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services have ailed.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Thermo Fisher here >>>)\n\nEaton shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing \u2013 Electronics industry over the past year (+56.3% vs. +23.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that expansion via mergers and acquisitions, rising demand from the new AI data center and reduction in production costs have been benefitting the company.\n\nHowever unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches remain major headwinds. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Eaton here >>>)\n\nShares of Palo Alto have underperformed the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry over the last six months (+13.9% vs. +20.2%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company\u2019s high acquisition-related expenses are denting its margins. Softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might also hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability.\n\nYet, continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, sustained focus on product innovation, the shift to subscription-based services and normalization of its supply chain across platforms are going to boost the company\u2019s prospects.\n\n(You can\u00a0read the full research report on Palo Alto here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) Up 11% in a Month: What's Next for Investors?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW shares have risen 10.7% over the past month, outperforming the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s growth of 5.2% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 7.9%.\n\nThe upswing was primarily driven by positive demand signals from other cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler Inc. ZS and CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD. As reported on May 30, Zscaler\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues increased 32% year over year, while non-GAAP earnings soared 83%. CrowdStrike reported its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jun 4, wherein revenues jumped 33%, while non-GAAP earnings rose 63%.\n\nThe latest quarterly results from Zscaler and CrowdStrike suggest that the demand environment for cybersecurity players is still strong. However, Palo Alto\u2019s slowing sales and earnings growth remains a major concern.\n\nOne-Month Price Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat\u2019s Hurting PANW\u2019s Top-Line Growth?\n\nOver the past year, Palo Alto has reported decelerated growth in revenues, billings and adjusted earnings. It has blamed uncertain macroeconomic conditions as the main reason behind this deceleration.\n\nHowever, the cybersecurity industry is highly competitive, with each player continuously innovating and vying for market share. To address these threats, Palo Alto is aiming to consolidate its customer base into a unified security platform, reducing reliance on smaller cybersecurity firms for specific services.\n\nThe strategy would have long-term benefits, including a more stable, predictable revenue stream and stronger market positioning. However, the company is offering free trials and deferred billing options to accelerate the adoption of this unified platform among customers, which is hurting Palo Alto\u2019s revenues, billings and adjusted earnings growth.\n\nPalo Alto expects fiscal 2024 revenues between $7.99 billion and $8.01 billion, indicating approximately 16% year-over-year growth, much lower than the 25% year-over-year rise it reported in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings is currently pegged at $5.57 per share, up by a penny over the past 30 days and indicating a 25.5% year-over-year increase. In fiscal 2023, non-GAAP earnings soared 76% on a year-over-year basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrong Long-Term Prospects\n\nDespite having near-term challenges, long-term prospects for Palo Alto seem to be bright. It is a market leader in cybersecurity, offering solutions that address network security, cloud security and endpoint protection. The company\u2019s next-generation firewall and advanced threat detection technologies are widely recognized and adopted by enterprises globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe global cybersecurity market is poised for substantial growth, with projections indicating an increase from $172.2 billion in 2023 to $424.97 billion by 2030, as per a report by Fortune Business Insights. Palo Alto Networks, with its comprehensive and innovative solutions, is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this expanding market.\n\nAn expanding portfolio is critical to Palo Alto\u2019s long-term prospects, enhancing its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity market. It is strategically expanding beyond its core firewall business and trying to capture market share in adjacent areas like Secure Access Service Edge.\n\nAn expanded portfolio generates multiple revenue streams, mitigating the impact of market fluctuations on any single product. This diversification ensures more stable and predictable financial performance, appealing to investors seeking long-term growth.\n\nAdditionally, Palo Alto has partnered with NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and other tech companies, including Celona, Druid, Ataya, NetScout Systems and NTT Data, to offer robust private 5G security solutions and services. Together, these companies aim to deliver a secure, high-performance private 5G environment that supports critical applications and services across various industries.\n\nUnder this partnership, NVIDIA brings advanced AI and machine learning capabilities, enhancing threat detection and response. This alliance not only strengthens Palo Alto\u2019s position in the emerging private 5G market but also boosts its ability to provide end-to-end security solutions tailored to the needs of modern enterprises.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nConsidering the robust demand environment, portfolio strength and a strong partner base, Palo Alto\u2019s long-term prospects seem to be bright. However, the company\u2019s strategy of consolidating its customer base into a unified security platform is likely to continue hurting revenue and earnings growth in the near term.\n\nAdditionally, PANW stock is trading at a significant premium compared to the Zacks Internet Software industry. Its forward 12-month P/S of 12.27X is higher than the industry\u2019s 2.76X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWe believe investors should wait for a better entry point for Palo Alto, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect and a stretched valuation in the near term.

        "title": "3 Overvalued Stocks Set for a Brutal Reality Check",
        "content": "The tech sector witnessed record highs on Tuesday, driven by continued interest in companies focused on artificial intelligence (AI). However, there are concerns about overvalued stocks as investors show exuberance around certain companies\u2019 prospects.\n\nRecent equity index gains appear to stem primarily from a small number of large firms. Even typically bullish analysts covering the tech industry believe enthusiasm has slightly surpassed rational expectations, suggesting a correction is on the line.\r\n\r\nAnalysts conclude that share prices of certain stocks from various sectors have exceeded earnings growth. Some shares have rocketed to unsustainable levels, warranting short-term declines. However, others face potential longer-term downside should fundamentals fail to justify high prices.\n\nInvestors tend to speculate on tech stocks that are not currently worthwhile but promising long-term. Several technology companies in 2024 have seen share prices rising faster than earnings.\r\n\r\nThe following three overvalued stocks could face a sobering reality should earnings fail to justify soaring share valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: photosince / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe data analytics and AI firm Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) continues to drive innovation in its industry. Its revenue grew 21% over the last year, reaching solid earnings levels for a large firm. The company also recently became profitable, with EBITDA increasing 37%. Such results would satisfy most industrial companies.\r\n\r\nHowever, Palantir\u2019s share price has risen 68% over the same period, resulting in an overvalued price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 215.3x. This ratio far exceeds what most investors find reasonable. PLTR stock price jumped when the company expanded into AI over a year ago. Yet, Palantir\u2019s earnings have not kept pace with the rising share price, leaving the company with triple-digit P/E ratios for almost a year.\n\nAnalysts are concerned about Palantir and believe it is one of the overvalued stocks set for a brutal reality check. Many recommend selling PLTR, with an average price target 16% below the current share price. Notably, PLTR stock recently reversed after reaching levels near its 52-week high.\n\nARM Holdings (ARM) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe U.K.-based chip designer ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) has received significant attention since its initial public offering (IPO) last year. ARM stock price has risen almost 200% since last September, a noteworthy performance given that the company designs but does not manufacture chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile ARM benefits from the hype around AI, it only recently established its own chip division and plans to enter the market next year. Currently, it relies on licensing and royalty fees from expanded server demand to support AI growth, fueling 47% revenue growth over the past year. However, it expects revenue growth to slow to approximately 22% for the next year, with similar earnings growth.\r\n\r\nDespite tempting financials, ARM\u2019s share price has risen much faster than earnings, leading to a P/E ratio of 582.7x. This positions it among the highest of overvalued stocks globally. On average, analysts expect ARM stock to decline to around $125.62, representing a potential downside of over 25% from current levels.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a cyber security company that protects cloud computing and servers, is the last pick on this list of overvalued stocks to consider letting go. It would naturally do well as AI drives demand for digital storage and decentralized processing.\n\nThe company saw its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by 33% over the last year. It delivered record cash flow generation and a 63% increase in its adjusted EPS to $0.93 per share. However, analysts have concluded that the fast 163% growth in CRWD stock prices over the last year has caused the stock to become overvalued, pushing its P/E ratio to 717x.\r\n\r\nThis overvaluation is one reason Piper Sandler\u2019s analyst downgraded the company\u2019s outlook. While CrowdStrike continues to see strong growth, it faces increased competition from Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW). There is also growing concern that market sentiment could turn at any moment and take the overvalued stock back to an industry-standard valuation of 48x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Under-the-Radar Tech Stocks With Millionaire-Maker Upside",
        "content": "There are more than 3,500 publicly listed companies in the U.S. today. Yet a handful of stocks get all the attention from the media, analysts and investors. These tend to be the mega-cap tech stocks that dominate the market and are responsible for the majority of its gains and losses. Attention tends to go to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because they have so much influence over the market\u2019s direction instead of some under-the-radar tech stocks.\n\nWhile it makes sense that the most influential stocks should get most of the attention, it also means many great under-the-radar tech stocks. This is disappointing as many of these neglected stocks are quietly rising and beating the returns seen in the broader market. Spotting these hidden gems can add big gains to a portfolio.\n\nHere are three under-the-radar tech stocks with millionaire-maker upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) doesn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as it deserves. Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) use the microchip-equipment maker\u2019s components. Yet the company and its stock receive only a fraction of the media attention given to its customers. This is largely due to Applied Materials being a going concern since 1967 and being viewed as Silicon Valley\u2019s founding father.\n\nSome of Applied Materials\u2019 equipment is so old that it is housed at the Smithsonian Museum. Regardless of its age, Applied Materials is still posting strong financial results, and its stock is responding. For its fiscal second quarter, Applied Materials most recently announced EPS of $2.09, which was ahead of analyst consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 a share. Revenue totaled $6.65 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $6.54 billion.\n\nThe strong results and bullish forward guidance continue to send AMAT stock higher. In the last 12 months, Applied Materials\u2019 share price has risen 67%.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar cybersecurity stock, look to Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company\u2019s stock is up 18% this year, but it badly trails the gains seen in its competitors, such as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose share price has gained 57%. The big problem at Palo Alto Networks is that the company has missed Wall Street forecasts on several occasions.\n\nMost recently, Palo Alto Networks reported quarterly billings that missed analyst estimates, sending its stock down nearly 10%. For the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter, billings came in at $2.33 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.34 billion. U.S. Analysts see the disappointing billing figure as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating headwinds.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the near-term challenges, 38 Wall Street analysts who cover the company rate Palo Alto Networks\u2019 stock a \u201cstrong buy\u201d and expect future gains.\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Applied Materials, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) is a semiconductor company whose stock flies under the radar of most investors but nevertheless outperforms. So far, in 2024, ADI stock is up nearly 20%. In the last five years, the share price has more than doubled. Also, like Applied Materials, Analog Devices continues to post strong quarterly prints that underpin its share price.\n\nIn May of this year, Analog Devices announced EPS of $1.40 for its fiscal second quarter, beating analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $1.26. Revenue came in at $2.16 billion, beating expectations for $2.11 billion. The company, which makes semiconductors used in data conversion and signal processing, attributed the strong results to rising orders and demand for its products, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, Analog Devices raised its forecast for the year\u2019s second quarter, saying it expects revenue of $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Analysts had forecast $2.16 billion in fiscal third-quarter sales. ADI stock also pays a quarterly dividend of 92 cents, giving it a yield of 1.60%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held long positions in AMAT and NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "Cybersecurity Stocks Q1 In Review: Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB) Vs Peers\n\nLet's dig into the relative performance of Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q1 cybersecurity earnings season.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and cybersecurity stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 4.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nTenable (NASDAQ:TENB)\n\nFounded in 2002 by three cybersecurity veterans, Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risk and how to reduce it.\n\nTenable reported revenues of $216 million, up 14.4% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 1.2%. It was a slower quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' billings estimates.\n\n\"We delivered strong results for the first quarter, highlighted by 14% revenue growth and 17% operating margin driven by traction in our unified platform,\" said Amit Yoran, Chairman and CEO of Tenable. Tenable Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 3.8% since the results and currently trades at $43.31.\n\nIs now the time to buy Tenable?

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.\n\nStory continues Zscaler Total Revenue\n\nZscaler scored the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The stock is up 27.7% since the results and currently trades at $198.6.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it's free.\n\nWeakest Q1: Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD)\n\nFounded in 2000 with the idea that network security comes before endpoint security, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) provides software as a service that helps companies understand where they are exposed to cyber security risks, quickly detect breaches and respond to them.\n\nRapid7 reported revenues of $205.1 million, up 12% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost -64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. The stock is down 8.1% since the results and currently trades at $42.1.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nVaronis (NASDAQ:VRNS)\n\nFounded by a duo of former Israeli Defense Forces cyber warfare engineers, Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) offers software-as-service that helps customers protect data from cyber threats and gain visibility into how enterprise data is being used.\n\nVaronis reported revenues of $114 million, up 6.2% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a decline in its gross margin and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.\n\nVaronis had the slowest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is up 6.6% since the results and currently trades at $47.58.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Varonis here, it's free.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations.

        "content": "The pursuit of financial freedom and a 6-figure net worth is a goal shared by many. While there are numerous investment strategies available, stocks for building wealth have long been a powerful tool for wealth creation.\n\nThe key to successful investing lies in identifying companies that demonstrate strong growth potential, solid financial health, and a competitive edge. However, approaching the market by investing in individual stocks is not the only prudent strategy. Investors can leverage investment vehicles like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for a more passive approach. But if you\u2019re willing to get your hands dirty and put in some extra work, there is certainly potential to outperform the market in the long term.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top 3 stocks for building wealth to reach the 6-figure net worth milestone by 2030!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a global leader in high-performance, high-efficiency server and storage hardware. The company will be a beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds, as its infrastructure is crucial to accelerate AI workloads in the cloud.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\u2019s growth potential is underpinned by the increasing demand for data storage and processing power. Its products are used in data centers, enterprise IT, artificial intelligence, and 5G infrastructure. As more businesses move their operations to cloud environments, the need for robust server solutions will continue to rise. The company continues to gain market share in 2024, and remains the preferred storage and server provider for hyperscale cloud providers. In Q3 FY24, revenue increased a whopping 200% year-over-year to $3.85 billion. Additionally, earnings per share also skyrocketed 328% YOY to $6.56 per share, driven by strong demand for AI rack scale solutions. With the rapid growth of data centers globally, SMCI stock stands as one of the best stocks for building wealth.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), a leading cybersecurity giant provides a comprehensive suite of products and services to protect organizations from cyber threats. Its offerings include firewall protection, advanced threat detection, and cloud security solutions.\n\nThe increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks have heightened the demand for robust cybersecurity measures. Hackers are getting more savvy, and are going after the largest organizations that have access to large amounts of sensitive data. One notable attack in 2024 is the ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), in which they had to pay a $22 million ransom to hackers. This unfortunate occurrence will position Palo Alto for continued growth given its strong reputation in the industry. Moreover, Palo Alto has demonstrated strong financial performance, with strong double digit revenue growth and impressive free cash flow. In its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 15% YOY to $2 billion. Additionally, EPS swelled 155% year over year to 79 cents per share. This makes PANW stock one of the top stocks for building wealth through 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nGodaddy (GDDY) GoDaddy website\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGodaddy (NYSE:GDDY) has established itself as a global leader in domain registration and web hosting services. The company\u2019s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 Index and its growing earnings and free cash flow are a positive sign for the future.\n\nGodaddy empowers individuals and small businesses to build an online presence. The company is no longer a one trick pony, as it has expanded its product offerings over the years. This includes website builders, e-commerce solutions, and digital marketing solutions for online business needs. Moreover, Godaddy\u2019s new Airo platform includes a full suite of AI tools for businesses. After delivering record revenue, earnings, and free cash flow in FY23, CEO Aman Bhutani continues to execute on strategic priorities. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue increased 7% YOY to $1.1 billion. Additionally, net earnings skyrocketed 749% year over year to $401.5 million, or $2.76 per share. Godaddy\u2019s focus on operational efficiency is steadfast, placing GDDY stock among the best growth stocks for building wealth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Cybersecurity Stocks Set to Double on $1 Trillion Industry Growth",
        "content": "In terms of cynical relevance, it doesn\u2019t get much better than cybersecurity growth stocks. While the digitalization ecosystem has fostered groundbreaking gains in connectivity and productivity, it also sparked worrying exposure to nefarious actions. To protect against these threats, both individual households and enterprises need robust defensive mechanisms.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a narrative. According to Grand View Research, the global cybersecurity market reached a valuation of $222.66 billion last year. Further, the sector may expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% by 2030. At the forecast culmination, the sector could be worth $500.7 billion. And that might be an underestimate.\n\nMcKinsey & Company points out that the arena could enjoy a total addressable market between $1.5 trillion and $$2 trillion. It\u2019s not an unreasonable forecast since digital threats are constantly evolving. In addition, the cost of a data breach can be enormous. On that note, investors can stand to profit handsomely from the below cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the leading cybersecurity growth stocks, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) offers a comprehensive suite of security solutions targeting enterprises. These solutions include network security, cloud security and endpoint protection. In addition, Palo Alto is well-known for developing advanced firewalls along with threat intelligence protocols. It\u2019s a large-capitalization firm but it still has room for expansion.\n\nOf course, a major benefit of a massive enterprise is market dominance. In the past four quarters, Palo Alto posted an average earnings per share of $1.40. The company beat all of its bottom-line targets during this one-year period. Indeed, the average earnings surprise came out to 12.35%, which is an impressive statistic.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Palo Alto posted net income of $2.45 billion or $6.92 per share. Revenue reached $7.79 billion. For fiscal 2024, EPS may expand by 25.45% to $5.57. On the top line, revenue may rise 16.1% to $8 billion. Again, it\u2019s a big entity but it also qualifies as one of the cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA global leader in integrate and automated cybersecurity solutions, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) offers a wide range of services. These include firewalls, encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) and endpoint security. Its primary feature may be its FortiGate firewalls, which are well regarded by data center operators for their performance and security measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, the company has beaten all of its past four bottom-line targets. During this period, the average EPS came out to over 43 cents. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 14.38%. Another standout feature of FTNT is that it\u2019s relatively undervalued. Shares trade at 8.68X trailing-year sales. In contrast, PANW trades at over 15X.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Fortinet posted net income of $1.2 billion or earnings of $1.54 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $5.4 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS to expand by 8.6% to $1.77. On the top line, sales may rise 9.3% to hit $5.8 billion. While FTNT doesn\u2019t offer the biggest expansion potential, it\u2019s one of the cybersecurity growth stocks due to the relative value.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpecializing in cloud security, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) provides secure Internet access and zero-trust network access through its platform. A key standout attribute of Zscaler is that its services can protect users, applications and data irrespective of location. Further, its zero-trust architecture and specialization in secure access service edge (SASE) make it powerfully relevant to enterprises migrating to the cloud.\n\nA resounding benefit of ZS stock is the underlying demand profile. In the past four quarters, Zscaler\u2019s average EPS came out to almost 74 cents. This print translated to an average earnings surprise of 33.43%. To be fair, investors will be paying a premium for this demand. Presently, ZS stock trades at 14.51X trailing-year revenue.\n\nAnother factor to watch is that in the TTM period, Zscale did lose $73.5 million or 50 cents per share. However, sales jumped to $2.03 billion. Further, its most recent quarterly revenue growth rate (year-over-year) stands at 32.1%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts see a big jump in EPS to $2.98. Revenue may rise 32.3% to $2.14 billion, making ZS one of the cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nOkta (OKTA) OKTA Stock: 4 Reasons To Like Okta Ahead Of Earnings\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the broader infrastructure software space, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) specializes in identity and access management. It provides secure access to applications and devices for enterprise-level clients. One element that distinguishes Okta from many other cybersecurity growth stocks is the incorporation of single sign-on, multi-factor authentication. As well, Okta offers lifecycle management.\n\nIf recent financial performances are anything to go by, Okta truly resonates with its customers. During the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS landed at almost 51 cents. In terms of earnings surprise, Okta generated a stat of 32.88%. That\u2019s impressive. Also, while the price-to-sales (PS) ratio of 6.61X is objectively elevated compared to standard software companies, it\u2019s relatively discounted.\n\nIn the TTM period, Okta did incur a net loss of $276 million or $1.67 per share. However, revenue hit $2.36 billion. Its most recent quarterly sales growth rate clocks in at 19.1%. For the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate 50.6% expansion in EPS to $2.41. Revenue may see a bump of 12.3% to $2.54 billion. It\u2019s another top-tier player among cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) CyberArk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother powerful enterprise within the cybersecurity realm, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) with its subsidiaries develops, markets and sells software-based identity security solutions and services. Its mainline product is Privileged Access Manager, which offers risk-based credential security and access. Demand should continue to rise for CYBR stock thanks to the underlying company\u2019s advanced protection against data breaches.\n\nOn a financial note, the company has been on an impressive run. During the past four quarters, CyberArk posted an average EPS of 50.3 cents. In contrast, the average estimated EPS for this period was 21.5 cents. This translated to an earnings surprise of nearly 112%. Granted, investors will be paying a premium, with shares trading at 14.39X trailing-year revenue.\n\nDuring the TTM period, CyberArk incurred a net loss of $26.01 million. However, revenue hit $811.73 million. Its most recent quarterly sales growth rate landed at 37%. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS may rise by 81.3% to $2.03. On the top line, sales could swing up by 24.4% to $935.2 million. It\u2019s easily one of the cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nRapid7 (RPD) A close-up shot of fingers over a keyboard with blue and white text overlaid.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the smaller but promising ideas among cybersecurity growth stocks, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) specializes in endpoint services to cloud data collection and sharing applications. It brings to the table advanced analytics and automation solutions, such as vulnerability management and incident detection and response. Thanks to its ability to identity and prioritize different threats, Rapid7 provides efficient management of the digital wilderness.\n\nBased on the underlying financial performance, it appears that enterprise clients recognize Rapid7\u2019s value. During the past four quarters, the company posted an average EPS of nearly 49 cents. However, the average anticipated EPS was only about 39 cents. Therefore, the earnings surprise in the period came out to 33.63%.\n\nEven better, RPD stock can be had for only 3.47X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s still elevated compared to the broader software sector. However, it\u2019s a discount compared to many other cybersecurity growth stocks.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that the company\u2019s EPS may rise 42.8% to hit $2.17. On the top line, sales may expand by 7.2% to $833.52 million.\n\nGen Digital (GEN) A man sitting in front of a computer\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLast but not least, we come to Gen Digital (NASDAQ:GEN). While the corporate name might not be familiar to people, its individual brands are. We\u2019re talking about programs such as North, Avast, AVG and CCleaner. What makes Gen Digital distinct is the focus on individual protection. Its robust product portfolio helps everyday users protect themselves against digital threats.\n\nTo be fair, GEN stock may be the riskiest idea on this list. At the least, it requires an assumption of what the underlying company could be as opposed to what it is. For example, Gen Digital\u2019s average EPS during the past four quarters came out to 49 cents. That\u2019s pretty much in line with analysts\u2019 overall expectations. The average earnings surprise was only 0.53%.\n\nStill, GEN stock is offered at a reasonable valuation at 4.19X trailing-year sales. During the TTM period, it posted net income of $616 million or 96 cents per share. Revenue hit $3.81 billion. For the current fiscal year, analysts expect 12.2% expansion in EPS to $2.20. On the top line, sales may rise 2.6% to $3.91 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Insiders Sell US$4.2m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",
        "content": "In the last year, many Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Independent Director, Carl Eschenbach, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.8m worth of shares at a price of US$237 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$340. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 32% of Carl Eschenbach's holding.\n\nInsiders in Palo Alto Networks didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\n\nInsiders At Palo Alto Networks Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Palo Alto Networks. In total, insiders sold US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Palo Alto Networks insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$1.0b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo What Do The Palo Alto Networks Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nInsiders sold Palo Alto Networks shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Palo Alto Networks is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Palo Alto Networks. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks you should be aware of, and 1 of these is concerning.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Palo Alto Networks' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions The top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Insiders have sold recently\n\nA look at the shareholders of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nLast week\u2019s 5.8% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 33%.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Palo Alto Networks, beginning with the chart below.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Palo Alto Networks. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Palo Alto Networks, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Palo Alto Networks. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.0% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.0b worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 21% stake in Palo Alto Networks. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Palo Alto Networks better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the  3 warning signs  we've spotted with Palo Alto Networks (including 1 which is significant) .\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this security software maker have returned +16.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palo Alto falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPalo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 points to a change of +25.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.19 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PANW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $8 billion and $9.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +13.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +5.6%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That\u2019s why investors should always dig into some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nGovernments, companies, cities, hospitals, consumers, and schools are still grossly unprepared for attacks. Most recently,\u00a0CDK Global, a company that provides U.S. auto dealers with software for sales management, was shut down because of new attacks.\n\nAs noted by CBS News at the time:\u00a0\u201cThe outage is disrupting roughly 15,000 car sellers that depend on CDK\u2019s dealer management software to run their businesses, including vehicle sales. Some dealership employees have resorted to pen and paper to handle transactions but said most deals had ground to a halt.

Davidson just initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $380, which would refill the stock\u2019s bearish gap.\n\nAnalysts at Argus also raised their price target on PANW to $348. \u201cThe analyst highlighted the increasing threats in the cybersecurity environment, including potential risks and opportunities presented by generative AI technology,\u201d says Investing.com.\n\nEarnings haven\u2019t been too shabby either. In its third quarter, EPS of $1.23 beat by 7 cents. Revenue of $1.98 billion \u2014 up 15.1% year over year \u2014 beat by $10 million.\n\nMoving forward, the company expects fourth-quarter billings to range from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is a year-over-year growth range of 9% to 10%. It also expects to see total revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, as compared to estimates of $2.16 billion.\n\nRapid7 (RPD) A person holding a tablet with a key lock hologram floating above it.

Today, it\u2019s up to $262.80 and could push even higher with growing cybersecurity threats.\n\nEarnings have been solid. In its first quarter, the company posted EPS of 75 cents, which beat by 48 cents. Revenue of $221.6 million \u2014 up 37% year over year \u2014 beat by $8.38 million.

        "title": "Why Is Zscaler (ZS) Stock Rocketing Higher Today",
        "content": "Why Is Zscaler (ZS) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cloud security platform Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) jumped 5.5% in the afternoon session after cybersecurity software provider and peer BlackBerry reported Q1'25 earnings results. Since the company reports off-cycle, there is likely some extra attention being paid to it given the lack of other peer datapoints. Specifically, BlackBerry reported revenue ahead of expectations, with sales partly benefitting from strong cybersecurity revenue, which beat consensus estimates.\n\nNotably, BlackBerry observed some improvements in key growth indicators, including net retention rate and annual recurring revenue. The results likely point to a more resilient demand for cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe positive sentiment shared during BB's earnings call and encouraging growth indicators called out during the quarter are a significant improvement compared to some choppier trends observed by enterprise software vendor Palo Alto Networks during last earnings season. Palo Alto's recent earnings results had been negatively impacted by multiple factors that affected billings and revenue growth, including weakness in the U.S. federal vertical and customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments.\n\nOverall, given the general SaaS skepticism in the last few months, this is evidence that cybersecurity, in particular, is holding up quite well.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nZscaler's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago, when the stock dropped 15.5% as cybersecurity stocks fell after industry stalwart, Palo Alto Networks reported fourth-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. This is never a good sign. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well.\n\nPalo Alto Networks highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) Customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments. The long-term demand forecast provided was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of \"a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a \"platformization\" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, Palo Alto Networks noted that a typical customer adopting the platform \" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months.\" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.\n\nOverall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance highlighting several issues within the business as well as potential challenges for cybersecurity players.\n\nZscaler is down 10.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $189.55 per share it is trading 25.6% below its 52-week high of $254.93 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Zscaler's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,440.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Box (BOX). Shares have lost about 5.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Box due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nBox Q1 Earnings & Revenues Surpass Estimates, Increase Y/Y\n\nBox reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share of 39 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. The figure jumped 21.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nTotal revenues of $264.66 million surpassed the consensus mark by 1.15%.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "The rise in cybercrime in recent years, driven by increased digitization and attackers deploying more advanced technologies, has increased investor interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nTo put things into perspective, experts predict that the cost of cybercrime will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. That\u2019s a massive number, considering that most cyberattacks can be prevented with better detection.\n\nIn response to these challenges, companies deploying technologies to combat malicious attacks are experiencing significant growth. The global cybersecurity market was $222.6 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% until 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne primary driver of this growth is AI, and its benefits are twofold. First, AI can be harnessed to detect potential cyber threats in a large volume of data in real time. Second, AI can identify areas requiring greater security controls through machine learning. This will help companies implement better prevention strategies while lowering costs.\n\nAs a result, companies actively incorporating AI in their cybersecurity offerings have become indispensable to businesses. Consequently, this has made them a wealth-generation channel for investors seeking long-term returns.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe increase in cybercrime has sparked interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. Leading the charge is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose shares surged over 173% this year. Several factors contribute to its success.\n\nThe first is a unique \u2018pay for what you pick\u2019 business model that has proven extremely successful. This approach allows customers to consolidate and customize modules to suit their needs on the platform. According to CrowdStrike, nearly 28% of its customers have adopted seven or more modules.\n\nThe second is its commitment to operating with a cloud-native architecture. CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon Horizon platform leverages automation and AI to identify threats across multi-cloud applications, thereby reducing cyberattack costs. Additionally, it allows users to manage workloads across cloud platforms through a single console.\n\nThis forward-thinking approach has paid off for the company. In its recent earnings report, revenue rose 33% to $921 million, with subscription revenue up 34% year-over-year (YoY). Revenue guidance for the full year was also raised by 30%.\n\nAs a leader in the cybersecurity space, CRWD trades at a premium valuation and is not a bargain buy. However, investors willing to hold the stock will find it to be one of the top cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. The company was recently added to the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother company making waves in the cybersecurity space is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). While the company is well known for its advanced firewall technology and cybersecurity solutions, Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42 gives it a competitive edge. Unit 42 is a team of world-renowned threat researchers that help federal agencies assess readiness and mitigate cyber risks. This research capability allows the company to gather valuable data and refine its risk mitigation strategies.\n\nThe success of Palo Alto\u2019s cybersecurity services was evident in its most recent earnings report. Revenue was up 15% YOY to $2 billion, and EPS came in at $1.32 over the estimated $1.26. However, shares fell 9% following weak billing guidance. Billing for the fiscal year will land in the $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion range, below the $10.19 billion estimate.\n\nBut despite the decline, PANW stock remains fundamentally strong. The company has exhibited consistent growth over the years, and its array of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions will serve as a catalyst for continued expansion.\n\nThe recent dip presents a great buying opportunity for investors looking to get behind cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Exterior view of Cloudflare headquarters. NET stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nA third name on this list of cybersecurity stocks to buy for long-term returns is Cloudflare (NYSE:NET). The company has embraced the role of GenAI in its offerings, proving it to be a useful tool in combating cyber attacks. Cloudflare\u2019s services include a content delivery network (CDN) that stores cached copies of websites closer to the site\u2019s visitors for easier access and a tool to help organizations combat bot-based attacks.\n\nClouflare\u2019s recent earnings report underscored the success of its offerings. Revenue in Q1 was up 30% YOY at $378.6 million. Adjusted EPS came in at 16 cents, surpassing an estimate of 13 cents. The company hopes to keep this momentum going through Q2, with revenue ranging between $393.5 million and $394.5 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Cloudflare is well-positioned to thrive in an AI-focused cybersecurity environment. The company maintains a successful partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), providing security enhancements for its users. Cloudflare\u2019s technology will also help encrypt AI queries in Apple\u2019s new Private Cloud Compute (PCC).\n\nThe company\u2019s promising prospects make this a good stock to add to your portfolio for long-term returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Palo Alto Networks Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Palo Alto Networks (PANW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PANW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Palo Alto Networks' main business drivers.\n\nSanta Clara, CA-based Palo Alto Networks, Inc. offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company's next generation firewall products deliver natively integrated application, user, and content visibility and control through its operating system, hardware and software architecture. It serves the enterprise network security market, which includes Firewall, Unified Threat Management (UTM), Web Gateway, Intrusion Detection and Prevention, and Virtual Private Network technologies.\r\n\r\nThrough its products and subscription services, Palo Alto provides integrated protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure. Its solutions incorporate application-specific integrated circuits, hardware architecture, operating system, and associated security and networking functions.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s network security gateways protect customer data, reduce security complexities and lower total cost of ownership. Customers can implement their security policies on traffic between internal networks and the Internet, as well as between internal and private networks shared with partners.\r\n\r\nThe company has a single operating segment. However, the company announces its revenues from products and services separately. For fiscal 2023, the company reported total revenues of $6.89 billion, which grew 25.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenues from its products increased 15.8% year over year to $1.58 billion. Revenues from subscriptions and support grew 28.4% to $5.31 billion.\r\n\r\nFurther, Palo Alto operates across different geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APAC).\r\n\r\nThe company faces competition from large companies like Cisco and Juniper, independent security vendors such as Symantec, Check Point, Fortinet, FireEye and several other small companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nPutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Palo Alto Networks, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.\n\nA $1000 investment made in June 2014 would be worth $12,064.54, or a gain of 1,106.45%, as of June 27, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 179.88% and the price of gold increased 67.84% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for PANW.\n\nPalo Alto has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security. PANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\n\nThe stock is up 5.98% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 14 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) In The Context Of Other Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the cybersecurity industry, including Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and its peers.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and while some of the cybersecurity stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was an ok quarter for the company:\u00a0Revenue beat by a small amount and operating profit as well as EPS beat by more convincing amounts.\n\n\"We are pleased with the enthusiastic response to platformization from our customers in Q3. Platformization is a long-term strategy that addresses the increasing sophistication and volume of threats, and the need for AI-infused security outcomes,\" said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reached $316.68, with a -1.14% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.31%.

        "content": "Cybersecurity company Crowdstrike\u2019s (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock joined the S&P 500 index alongside the stocks of GoDaddy (NASDAQ:GDDY) and KKR (NYSE:KKR).\n\nCRWD stock rose sharply in pre-market trading this morning. Despite a slight dip around 11:00 a.m. Eastern, the shares have been mostly stable since the market opened. CRWD stock carries a price of $378 per share and a market capitalization of about $92 billion. Shares are up 53% so far in 2024 and nearly 490% since it came public about five years ago.\n\nBig Days for CyberCops\n\nCybersecurity has become a huge market over the last few years due to growing global tensions, the rise of criminal gangs, and the increased complexity of cloud-based computing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe total market was estimated to be worth $181 billion last year and is growing at 10% per year.\n\nCrowdstrike, based in Austin, is considered the leader in endpoint security within the cloud security market. It has about 18% of that $8.6 billion market despite competing directly with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is expanding into general cloud security.\n\nFor the quarter ending in May Crowdstrike earned $43 million, 18 cents per share fully diluted, on revenue of $921 million. The company is estimating full-year earnings will be about $4 per share on revenue of about $4 billion.\n\nCrowdstrike\u2019s lead product is Falcon Defender, which it says can detect a cyberattack on a client\u2019s infrastructure in just four minutes. Equivalent products using the same tests from Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) took 24 minutes to detect an attack. Crowdstrike also said its attack reports were more accurate than those of competitors.\n\nStocks entering the S&P 500 always get a boost as hedge funds trading the index are required to buy them. Shares of private equity firm KKR have gone up 11% since their inclusion was announced.\n\nCrowdstrike has recently benefited from Microsoft\u2019s bungled launch of its Recall feature.

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Put Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow Fast Is Palo Alto Networks Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It is awe-striking that Palo Alto Networks' EPS went from US$0.72 to US$7.56 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.\n\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Palo Alto Networks is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 9.0 percentage points to 11%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Palo Alto Networks?\n\nAre Palo Alto Networks Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$104b company like Palo Alto Networks. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$957m. We note that this amounts to 0.9% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Palo Alto Networks but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add Palo Alto Networks To Your Watchlist?\n\nPalo Alto Networks' earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Palo Alto Networks for a spot on your watchlist. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 3 warning signs  with Palo Alto Networks (at least 1 which is potentially serious)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "2023 was a record year for ransomware attacks and the threat landscape has worsened this year. Bad actors have laid siege on government and enterprise systems, causing data leakages, financial losses and reputational damage. The only solutions to these threats are products offered by top cybersecurity stocks to buy now.\n\nAfter a series of high-profile attacks this year, the message is clear: companies and government agencies must prioritize cyber spending. Otherwise, they might face a sophisticated attack like the Change Healthcare attack that took several weeks to clean up.\n\nWith Chief Security Information Officers increasing their investments, the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now are poised for a secular bull run. Gartner forecast calls for security and risk management spending to rise 14% in 2024 and McKinsey sees a $2 trillion addressable market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith threats proliferating, cybersecurity spending will be on an upward trajectory. Moreover, growth in public cloud and remote work only heightens the need for cloud security and identity management tools. Under these conditions, these cybersecurity stocks to buy now will soar.\n\nOkta (OKTA) Okta, Inc. Logo seen on billboard. Okta (formerly Saasure Inc.) is an American identity and access management company based in San Francisco\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most common ways hackers access organization data is by compromising the identity of authorized users. Today, 80% of data breaches involve some form of compromised identity. To quell this threat, companies are seeking the best identity management solutions to fight this menace.\n\nOkta (NASDAQ:OKTA), which provides cyber solutions for user authentication and identity controls, will profit. Today, it is leading the fight against identity attacks. The company offers a unified identity solution that covers access management, privileged access and identity governance. Furthermore, it\u2019s rapidly bringing innovations like Identity Security Posture to market.\n\nDue to its multi-layered approach to identity security, Okta has emerged as one of the top solutions, beating competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This market advantage has led to stellar revenue growth. In the latest Q1 fiscal year 2025 report, total revenue increased 19% to $617 million and current remaining performance obligations grew by 15% to $1.9 billion.\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, Okta expects to achieve revenues of at least $2.53 billion, representing 12% growth. Still, with an $80 billion market opportunity, the identity management provider has a long growth runway.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy now, considering the secular tailwinds in cyber and its strong execution record. It\u2019s worth noting that it has grown free cash flow at a 30% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 10 years. As a result, the share price has compounded at a similar rate.\n\nThat said, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing for Fortinet recently. A report by Bleeping Computer revealed that an espionage attack by Chinese hackers on its cybersecurity system, FortiGate, was larger than previously indicated. This news has created an opportunity for long-term investors. At 30 times fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates, Fortinet is among the top cybersecurity stocks to buy now.\n\nIn terms of long-term fundamentals, Fortinet is well-positioned in its three growth pillars: network security, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Security Operations. It\u2019s the leader in network security with its firewall products and continues to gain market share. Management expects faster growth than the market\u2019s 10%.\n\nLastly, SASE will be a major growth engine as Fortinet leverages its 700,000 network security customers and 12 million deployed firewalls. Management plans to leverage this installed base to upsell and cross-sell SASE products.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cybersecurity giant has been consolidating between $260 and $325 since its Q2 fiscal year 2024 earnings in February. Investors have raised questions about its platformization strategy and its billings. However, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) remains one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now for the secular growth in cyber.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the bearish points. Palo Alto shifted to a platformization strategy to win market share. Although it has offered free use periods as trials, these customers end up signing more than three-year deals. On billings, the metric has slowed due to deferred payments caused by a high interest rate environment rather than lower demand.\n\nOn the bullish case, Palo Alto offers one of the best cybersecurity platforms. It enjoys product leadership in 23 categories organized into three platforms \u2013 network security, cloud security, and security ops. These platforms are tightly integrated into one solution. About 50% of the top 5,000 customers use two or more platforms, accounting for about 80% of next-generation security annual recurring revenue.\n\nIn addition to the best-in-class platform, the company has also improved margins significantly. In Q3 FY 2024, non-GAAP operating margins increased by 200 basis points YOY to 26%. Lastly, management expects at least 16% revenue growth and 38.5% adjusted free cash flow margins in FY2024. Indeed, this is a top cyber play with impressive growth and profitability.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These assaults use legitimate credentials and technology, making them hard to detect and counter.\u200b\n\nOver 25% of 2023 attacks were on manufacturing.

CyberArk will integrate Venafi\u2019s technologies onto its platform following the acquisition to improve security.\n\nAlso, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company\u2019s choice of CyberArk\u2019s Identity Security Platform for cloud migration demonstrates the company\u2019s credibility.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, CyberArk hosts its security platform in the UAE to comply with data sovereignty requirements and provide better protection to local customers.\n\nCyberArk also exhibited CORA AI at IMPACT 24, boosting its reputation as a buy cybersecurity stock. New AI-powered features improve identity security in many settings and enhance risk identification and response.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Palo Alto (PANW) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Palo Alto Networks (PANW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nPalo Alto currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 30 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.2% and 4.6% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PANW Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PANW\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Palo Alto here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Palo Alto, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs PANW Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Palo Alto, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.57.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Palo Alto.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PANW) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ:PANW) stock increased significantly by 10% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Palo Alto Networks'  ROE today.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palo Alto Networks is:\n\n55% = US$2.4b \u00f7 US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.55 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Earnings Growth And 55% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Palo Alto Networks has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, Palo Alto Networks' considerable five year net income growth of 65% was to be expected.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Palo Alto Networks' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Palo Alto Networks is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nPalo Alto Networks doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Palo Alto Networks' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) Up 1.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Shares have added about 1.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Palo Alto due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nPalo Alto Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $1.32 per share for the third quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. The bottom line improved 20% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s non-GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share and came above the company\u2019s earlier guidance range of $1.24-$1.26.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s third-quarter revenues of $1.98 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion and rose 15% from the year-ago reported figure. Third-quarter revenues also came toward the higher end of management\u2019s previously provided guidance range of $1.95-$1.98 billion.\n\nThe top line was primarily driven by growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments. Additionally, the increased adoption of Palo Alto\u2019s Next-Generation Security platforms, driven by the hybrid work culture and the heightened need for stronger security, also aided third-quarter results.\n\nThe company\u2019s strong quarterly performance reflects its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, building sales capability, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy.\n\nBillings increased 3% to $2.33 billion in the third quarter and came within the company\u2019s projection of $2.3-$2.35 billion.\n\nThird-Quarter Performance\n\nProduct revenues increased 0.7% year over year to $391 million and contributed to 19.7% of the total revenues. The company\u2019s Subscription and Support revenues, which accounted for 80.3% of the total revenues, improved 19.6% to $1.59 billion.\n\nDeferred revenues at the end of the fiscal third quarter were $5.01 billion. Palo Alto\u2019s remaining performance obligation climbed to $11.3 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 23%.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s next-generation security annualized recurring revenues were $3.79 billion in the reported quarter compared with $3.49 billion in the previous quarter and $2.57 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nNon-GAAP gross profits increased 17.6% to $1.54 billion. The non-GAAP gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 77.6%, primarily driven by a higher software mix, normalization in the supply-chain environment and some efficiencies in customer support.\n\nThe non-GAAP operating income rose 24.9% to $507.9 million. Meanwhile, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 200 bps to 25.6% compared with the year-ago quarter.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nPalo Alto exited the fiscal third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.89 billion, down from $3.37 billion at the end of the previous quarter. As of Apr 30, 2024, the company had long-term operating lease liabilities of $369.8 million.\n\nPANW generated operating cash flow of $528.9 million and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $491.5 million in the fiscal third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin for the second quarter came in at approximately 25%. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, the company generated operating cash flow of $2.75 billion and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow of $2.63 billion.\n\nGuidance Update\n\nPalo Alto raised its fiscal 2024 guidance for revenues and billings. The company now projects revenues between $7.99 billion and $8.01 billion, up from the earlier guidance range of $7.95-$8 billion. Similarly, the guidance range for fiscal 2024 billings has been raised to $10.13-$10.18 billion from $10.1-$10.2 billion anticipated earlier. The year-over-year growth ranges for updated revenues and billings guidance are 16% and 10-11%, respectively.\n\nPalo Alto raised its non-GAAP earnings forecast to the $5.56-$5.58 per share band from the $5.45-$5.55 per share range anticipated previously. The company also raised its non-GAAP operating margin guidance for fiscal 2024 to 26.8-27% from 26.5-27% projected earlier.\n\nThe guidance range for the non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin has been revised upward to 38.5-39% from 38-39% forecasted previously. The projection for next-generation security ARR has been revised upward to $4.05-$4.10 billion from $3.95-$4 billion anticipated previously.\n\nPalo Alto initiated guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, PANW projects revenues between $2.15 billion and $2.17 billion, which suggests year-over-year growth of 10-11%. Total billings are anticipated between $3.43 billion and $3.48 billion, which indicates an increase of 9-10% from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.40-$1.42 per share.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 10.05% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Palo Alto has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Palo Alto has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nPalo Alto belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry. Another stock from the same industry, Sea Limited Sponsored ADR (SE), has gained 4.1% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nSea Limited reported revenues of $3.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.8%. EPS of $0.21 for the same period compares with $0.61 a year ago.\n\nSea Limited is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -34.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Sea Limited. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of D.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks",
        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) Vs The Rest Of The Cybersecurity Stocks\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the cybersecurity industry, including CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and its peers.\n\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the fastest-growing segments within software for good reason. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance. This migration has opened them to a multitude of new threats, like employees accessing data via their smartphone while on an open network, or logging into a web-based interface from a laptop in a new location.\n\nThe 9 cybersecurity stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 0.5% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the cybersecurity stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 3.4% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD)\n\nFounded by George Kurtz, the former CTO of the antivirus company McAfee, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity software that protects companies from breaches and helps them detect and respond to cyber attacks.\n\nCrowdStrike reported revenues of $921 million, up 33% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 1.8%. It was a strong\u00a0quarter for the company:\u00a0CrowdStrike narrowly topped analysts' revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) expectations, showing customers continue investing in its products. Looking ahead, it raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections.\n\n\u201cCrowdStrike started the fiscal year from a position of momentum and exceptional strength, with net new ARR of $212 million growing 22% year-over-year and ending ARR growing 33% year-over-year to reach $3.65 billion,\u201d said George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's president, chief executive officer and co-founder. CrowdStrike Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is up 27.6% since the results and currently trades at $390.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike?

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' billings estimates and a solid beat of analysts' ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates. Zscaler Total Revenue\n\nZscaler achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The stock is up 15.7% since the results and currently trades at $179.97.\n\nIs now the time to buy Zscaler?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and decelerating customer growth.\n\nRapid7 had the weakest full-year guidance update in the group. The company lost 64 customers and ended up with a total of 11,462. The stock is down 20.7% since the results and currently trades at $36.33.\n\nRead our full analysis of Rapid7's results here.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.98 billion, up 15.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was an ok quarter for the company:\u00a0Revenue beat by a small amount and operating profit as well as EPS beat by more convincing amounts.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this security software maker have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palo Alto falls in, has gained 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, indicating a change of -2.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.57 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.5%. This estimate has changed +5.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 indicates a change of +11.3% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palo Alto is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PANW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $8 billion and $9.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +13.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +5.6%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Now An Opportune Moment To Examine Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW)?",
        "content": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth of 20% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Palo Alto Networks\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Still Cheap?\n\nGood news, investors! Palo Alto Networks is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $474.69, but it is currently trading at US$317 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Palo Alto Networks\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of Palo Alto Networks look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Palo Alto Networks, at least in the near future.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although PANW is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to PANW, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on PANW for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 is concerning!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Palo Alto Networks, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares of the cybersecurity firm Rubrik Inc. rose in late trading on Tuesday after its inaugural earnings results exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHunter Biden Convicted of Gun Charges by Jury in Delaware Apple Hits Record After Introducing \u2018AI for the Rest of Us\u2019 Musk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Dozens of CVS Generic Drug Recalls Expose Link to Tainted Factories Stocks Rise as Solid Treasury Sale Spurs CPI Bets: Markets Wrap\n\nThe Palo Alto, California-based company that publicly listed less than two months ago posted revenue of $187.3 in the fiscal first quarter, above the $171.5 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates and up 38% from a year earlier. Annual recurring revenue from subscriptions also beat forecasts. After initially gaining as much as 10%, the company\u2019s shares were up about 3% at 5 p.m. in New York after-hours trading.\n\nRubrik said it expects to post revenue of $810 million to $824 million for the fiscal year and as much as $997 million in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, both of which top analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe company projects revenue in the current period ending in July of $195 million to $197 million; the average of analysts\u2019 estimates was $195 million.\n\nRubrik went public at a volatile time for cybersecurity companies. While high-profile, large-scale cyberattacks have been on the rise, customers are also tightening their belts, reining in spending and consolidating their vendors. Cyber companies including Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Fortinet Inc. have both issued downbeat forecasts amid a slowdown in enterprise sales. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. bucked the trend last week, delivering a first-quarter earnings beat.\n\nRubrik, which protects companies\u2019 data across cloud and software-as-a-service operations, became the second enterprise software startup in the past two years to launch a substantial US IPO when it listed in New York in April. It rode a wave of excitement over a rebound in the IPO market, posting orders for its April offering that were 20-fold the 23.5 million shares it had on offer.\n\nWells Fargo analysts said they had expected Rubrik to \u201cdeliver one of the few \u2018beat and raise\u2019 performances\u201d in the first-quarter earnings cycle despite \u201cmediocre performances\u201d from rivals.\n\nThe recent cyberattack against UnitedHealth Group Inc. and the hacking campaign targeting Snowflake Inc. customers have underscored the rising demand for Rubrik\u2019s services, Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Nowinski said. \u201cAll these big breaches speak to the need for cyber resilience,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Rubrik provides.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2021, Microsoft made an investment in Rubrik that valued the company at about $4 billion. Rubrik committed to spending $220 million over 10 years on Microsoft\u2019s cloud-computing platform Azure, which it planned to use for data security and cloud services, filings show.\n\nRubrik was founded in 2013 and released its first product in 2016. The company said in April that it had more than 6,100 customers including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc., Home Depot and PepsiCo Inc. It also works with governments and universities.\n\n(Updates with additional forecase data from Rubrik starting in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown Tesla Shareholders Face the $56 Billion Question Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now That Look Ready to Split",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) boom promises to create fortune-building opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Key providers of AI infrastructure and applications could be particularly attractive investments as they're likely to benefit disproportionately from the tech industry's growth.\n\nAI leaders that enact forward stock splits could receive an additional boost. Splits may not change the fundamental value of a business, but investors view them as a vote of confidence from management on the company's prospects. Stocks that split tend to be performing well and often go on to set new highs.\n\nIf you're looking to buy some top-quality AI stocks that could choose to split their stocks in the near future, read on.\n\nPotential stock split No. 1: Super Micro Computer\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) state-of-the-art semiconductor technology has helped to usher in the AI explosion. The chipmaker's stock price, in turn, has soared. Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) supplies high-performance servers and data storage systems that go hand in hand with Nvidia's massively popular AI chips -- and its shares have performed even better than the tech giant's so far this year. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company -- known as Supermicro -- grew at a blistering pace in its most recent quarter. Sales for the period ended March 31 rocketed 201% year over year to $3.9 billion. Earnings per share increased an even more impressive 329% to $6.56.\n\nSupermicro's close ties to Nvidia and rapid pace of innovation are enabling the AI hardware manufacturer to outpace its competitors. Supermicro was fast to market with its liquid-cooled AI SuperClusters for Nvidia's new Blackwell AI computing platform. The easily scalable data center systems help to accelerate AI model training and inference while also reducing energy costs.\n\n\"Supermicro has designed cutting-edge Nvidia accelerated computing and networking solutions, enabling the trillion-dollar global data centers to be optimized for the era of AI,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release announcing Supermicro's new SuperClusters on June 4.\n\nConsidering its sterling recent operating performance and tantalizing growth potential, you'd think that Supermicro's shares would be trading near all-time highs. Yet that's not the case today. Its previously high-flying stock price has pulled back as of late and now sits about 37% off from its 52-week highs.\n\nTherein lies your opportunity. Supermicro's stock can now be had for less than 23 times its projected profits in 2025. That's an attractive price for an AI star that's forecast to increase its earnings by 62% annually over the next half-decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, with its share price standing at nearly $800, Supermicro might soon decide to split its stock to make it more affordable for everyday investors. This could help spark a rally in its stock price that sends it back higher.\n\nPotential stock split No. 2: Palo Alto Networks\n\nIn addition to high-performance hardware, cybersecurity is a vital component of any effective AI strategy. Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is a leading provider of crucial cloud security services, and AI is set to fuel its growth.\n\nAI demands data. Protecting that data is of paramount importance. Failure to do so could result in loss of customer trust, massive regulatory fines, and other costly financial penalties.\n\nIn turn, global demand for cybersecurity solutions will reach $500 billion by the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research. Consulting giant McKinsey, meanwhile, expects the market for products and services that safeguard the digital economy to eventually grow to a whopping $2 trillion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a top dog in this booming industry. It offers a broad array of tools, such as next-generation firewalls and advanced threat prevention services, delivered through a single, consolidated platform. This unified approach helps to reduce complexity and accelerate incident response times for customers.\n\nIts scale is another powerful competitive advantage. With more than 80,000 business customers, the cyber guardian has more data to analyze. That helps its machine learning technology constantly grow smarter. And once its AI-powered platform detects a new threat, it updates its defenses immediately.\n\nPalo Alto clearly has a promising long-term future. It could also receive a near-term lift from a potential stock split. Like Supermicro, its shares are trading at a relatively lofty price of around $300. The company chose to split its stock back in 2022 to make it more accessible for prospective shareholders. Doing so again today could boost demand for its shares among individual investors, which could help to place its stock price on a path to new highs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Palo Alto Networks, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.081 = US$880m \u00f7 (US$18b - US$7.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2024).\n\nTherefore, Palo Alto Networks has an ROCE of 8.1%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Software industry average of 7.2%.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Palo Alto Networks' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Palo Alto Networks .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nWe're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 8.1%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 154%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Palo Alto Networks thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Palo Alto Networks can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 351% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nPalo Alto Networks does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis,and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Super Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying if She's Right",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is the head of Ark Investment Management, which operates eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on innovative technology stocks. Last year, she said software companies will likely be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they could generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on hardware from chip giants like Nvidia.\n\nSince making that prediction, Wood has piled into several AI software opportunities. The Ark Venture Fund recently bought shares in private companies like ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Claude creator Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI. Plus, Tesla is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF because Wood believes its autonomous self-driving software is the biggest AI opportunity in the world.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, a number of other stocks could deliver spectacular returns in the coming years. Here's why investors might want to buy shares in Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) and C3.ai(NYSE: AI).\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks: A leader in AI-based cybersecurity\n\nPalo Alto Networks has observed a tenfold increase in the frequency of cyber attacks like phishing emails over the past year. AI makes it easy for malicious actors to craft realistic content designed to trick corporate employees into handing over sensitive information. Unfortunately, over 90% of security operations centers (SOCs) still rely on human-led processes, meaning 23% of incidents are left uninvestigated because they can't keep up with the sheer volume.\n\nAI-powered cybersecurity helps solve that problem, because it automates threat detection and incident response. Palo Alto offers a large portfolio of AI tools for cloud security, network security, and security operations. For example, the company launched the Cortex XSIAM platform last year, which is designed to automate the SOC, and it's delivering powerful results for customers.\n\nFor one oil and gas company, XSIAM reduced the number of incidents requiring human investigation by 75%. For another customer with a service-based business, XSIAM reduced the time it takes to respond to incidents from three days to just 16 minutes. Simply put, fewer security alerts slip through the cracks thanks to this platform, and it significantly reduces the workload on human employees.\n\nPalo Alto generated $2.0 billion in revenue during the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended April 30), which was a 15% increase from the year-ago period. That marked a slowdown, sequentially and year over year, which is expected to be temporary, mainly because the company is shifting its business model toward \"platformization.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto customers who use all three of its platforms (cloud, network, and operations) have a lifetime value 40 times higher than those using just one. Therefore, the company is targeting customers who have contracts with competing vendors by giving them products for free until those contracts expire. At that time, they can consolidate their cybersecurity stack with Palo Alto, which makes them significantly more valuable over the long term.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2024, the company expects to have $4.1 billion in annual recurring revenue from such customers, which will be a 39% increase from the previous year. By fiscal 2030, it plans to more than triple that figure to $15 billion, so now might be a great time to buy in ahead of that growth phase.\n\n2. C3.ai: An enterprise AI company with accelerating growth\n\nC3.ai was founded in 2009, long before the AI hype train left the station. It's an enterprise AI company that has developed over 40 ready-made applications for businesses in 19 different industries. They allow those customers to integrate AI more quickly and at a lower cost compared to developing the technology themselves.\n\nC3.ai's applications are especially popular with non-technology companies like those in the energy, financial services, and manufacturing industries. Banks, for example, use C3.ai's Smart Lending application to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, and they use C3.ai's Anti-Money Laundering application to autonomously detect suspicious transactions and fraud.\n\nChemical manufacturing giant Dow Inc. is using C3.ai's Reliability application for predictive maintenance, which has reduced downtime in steam cracking equipment by 20%. Less downtime equals more money saved, which instantly enhances profitability.\n\nC3.ai had 487 customer engagements in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended April 30), which was a whopping 70% increase from the year-ago period. It highlights how quickly demand for AI is growing in the corporate sector. It translated to a record-high $86.6 million in revenue during Q4, up 20% year over year, marking the fastest growth in almost two years.\n\nIt was also the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerated growth, and management's forecast for the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ending July 31) points to an even faster revenue increase of up to 23%. The company is reaping the rewards of a transition to consumption-based revenue (from subscription-based) it made two years ago, which allows customers to sign up more easily and quickly scale their spending. In other words, C3.ai's top-line results should continue to improve.\n\nThe company lost $14 million on a\u00a0non-GAAP (adjusted) basis in Q4 because it's still investing heavily in growth initiatives, but it has a solid balance sheet with $750 million in cash and equivalents that can sustain its current posture well into the future. If Wood is right, investors with a long-term horizon of at least five years might do extremely well owning this stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks PANW has been focusing on offering regionally-hosted cloud-based cybersecurity solutions to meet regulatory requirements. In this connection, it recently established a new cloud location in Indonesia for hosting its cloud services.\n\nThe local customers of Indonesia had to use Prisma Access to be able to operate the Palo Alto products till now. The new cloud location will now enable these customers to expand on a range of locally hosted cloud products that include Prisma Cloud, Cortex XDR, Cortex XSOAR, Cortex Xpanse and Cortes XSIAM.\n\nWith the rising demand for cloud-based services and products, companies are focusing on stricter data security measures. Numerous countries have made it necessary to have data centers and cloud locations inside the national boundaries. The regionally-hosted cloud locations help Palo Alto in meeting the regulatory requirements, thereby gaining more customers.\n\nPANW\u2019s new local cloud establishment will build the trust of companies operating in Indonesia which might further increase the market share and add to its top line. Apart from Indonesia, Palo Alto has its local cloud locations in more than 87 countries.\n\nPalo Alto's year-to-date (YTD) share price performance has been marked by significant volatility, reflecting broader market fluctuations and company-specific developments. YTD, the stock has gained 2.3%, underperforming the Zacks Internet \u2013 Software industry\u2019s growth of 11.5%.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Quote\n\nIndonesian Market Offers Huge Opportunity\n\nPer a report by Mordor Intelligence, the Indonesian cloud market is projected to reach $4.21 billion by 2029 from $2.13 billion in 2024, witnessing a CAGR of 14.52%.\n\nThe growing cloud dependency of Indonesian corporations had previously attracted industry giants, including Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon\u2019s AMZN Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft entered the local cloud-hosting landscape of Indonesia in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Per a report by Statista, Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud, Amazon\u2019s AWS and Microsoft\u2019s Azure currently hold a market share of 15%, 30% and 13%, respectively, in the public cloud market.\n\nWith the expansion of cloud services in Indonesia, the need for cloud security will increase in the country and PANW will be able to capitalize on it. This will enable Palo Alto to provide cyber-threat prevention to companies using cloud services locally.\n\nThe growth in cloud reliance had earlier prompted the Indonesian government to issue Law No. 27 of 2022 on Personal Data Protection. The law controls cloud service providers with a range of clauses. PANW\u2019s local cloud location expansion in Indonesia will allow it to meet local data residency needs.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto will also be able to get a competitive advantage over its competitors that do not have their local cloud facilities in Indonesia. New and existing clients in the country having stricter data security measures will stick with PANW\u2019s solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nPANW is expanding its cloud footprint in developing nations and is capitalizing on the massive demand for cloud-based cybersecurity services in these nations. This will definitely contribute positively to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s top line over the long run. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPalo Alto has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security. PANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\n\nPalo Alto expects its revenues in the range of $7.99-$8.01 billion for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $8 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 16%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Where Will CrowdStrike Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) posted its latest earnings report on Tuesday, June 4. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended on April 30, the cybersecurity company's revenue rose 33% year over year to $921 million and exceeded analysts' estimates by $16 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 63% and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.04.\n\nCrowdStrike followed up its earnings beat by lifting its full-year revenue and earnings outlook. Its stock rallied in response to that glowing report, but does it still have room to run after more than doubling over the past 12 months? Let's review its growth trajectory and valuations to see where it might be headed in a year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAnother quarter of stabilizing growth\n\nCrowdStrike stands out in the crowded cybersecurity market because it only provides its endpoint security tools as cloud-based services instead of on-site appliances. That approach is cheaper, doesn't require on-site maintenance, and is easier to scale as an organization expands. It also locks its clients into sticky cloud-based subscriptions.\n\nCrowdStrike's first mover's advantage in the cloud-native space enabled it to disrupt many older cybersecurity companies. That's why its revenue grew at a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2024). But over the past year, its growth cooled off as the macro headwinds made it harder to gain new customers and cross-sell additional cloud-based modules.\n\nIts revenue still increased 36% in fiscal 2024, but its growth in ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) decelerated as its net new ARR (the amount of ARR from new customers) declined in the first half of the year. Those two consecutive quarters of declining net new ARR spooked the bulls, but that closely watched metric accelerated again in the second half of the year. As a result, the company's revenue growth broadly stabilized over the past two quarters.\n\nMetric Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024 Q1 2025 Ending ARR growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 34% 33% Net new ARR growth (YOY) (8%) (10%) 13% 27% 22% Revenue growth (YOY) 42% 37% 35% 33% 33%\n\nData source: CrowdStrike. YOY = Year-over-year.\n\nCrowdStrike now expects its revenue to rise 30% to 31% for the full year, compared to its previous outlook for 28% to 31% growth. It attributed that robust growth to its market share gains, new government contracts, and the expansion of its platform with more generative AI features. At the end of the first quarter, 44% of its customers had adopted at least six of its modules, up from 43% in the fourth quarter and 40% in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike continues to grow at a healthy clip while many of its peers -- including Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) -- still struggle to gain new customers in this challenging environment. During the first-quarter conference call, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz took a jab at Palo Alto Networks' recent platformization strategy (which is currently driven by free trials and deferred revenue deals) -- by saying that \"when a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\"\n\nIts margins are still expanding\n\nIn the first quarter, CrowdStrike's adjusted subscription gross margin held steady year over year at 80%, its adjusted operating margin expanded five percentage points to 22%, and it stayed firmly profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for the fifth consecutive quarter as it reined in its stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nThose expanding margins indicate CrowdStrike still has plenty of pricing power and that economies of scale are kicking in as it gains more customers. It expects its free cash flow (FCF) margin to rise from 31% in fiscal 2024 to 31%-33% in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn the bottom line, it expects its adjusted EPS to increase 27% to 30% for the full year. That's also higher than its previous outlook for 22% to 28% growth.\n\nBut can CrowdStrike maintain its premium valuation?\n\nCrowdStrike's growth rates are impressive, but its stock isn't cheap. At $326 per share, it trades at 82 times the midpoint of its projected earnings for fiscal 2025. Its enterprise value of $71 billion is roughly 18 times this year's estimated sales.\n\nBy comparison, Palo Alto Networks -- which is growing slower but has a more broadly diversified ecosystem -- trades at 46 times forward earnings and 12 times this year's sales. In other words, CrowdStrike will need to keep hitting home runs over the next few quarters to drive its stock even higher in this volatile market.\n\nWhere will CrowdStrike's stock be in a year?\n\nCrowdStrike is clearly disrupting legacy cybersecurity companies with its cloud-native services, it's squeezing more revenue from its customers, and its margins are rising. I don't think its stock will double again over the next 12 months, but I believe it should gradually climb higher as it continues to beat Wall Street's expectations. It should also have plenty of room to run over the long term as the cloud-native cybersecurity market expands.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "content": "If you\u2019re trying to hone in on which tech stocks to buy this month, you\u2019ve come to the right place. The technology sector continues to carry the stock market higher. In just six months, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tripled its market valuation to $3 trillion and replaced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable stock (it recently slipped back to third place).\n\nYet other tech stocks are performing just as good or better than the chipmaker. Software company Dave (NASDAQ:DAVE) has quadrupled in value this year, rising almost 400%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 170%, though that has more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bubbling up again.\n\nWhat it shows, though, is significant profit-making opportunities remain in the sector and the following three tech stocks to buy could be the next to explode higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year\u2019s tech darling Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is growing slower this year \u2013 but not by much. After tacking on 250% gains in 2023, it is \u201conly\u201d 172% higher this time around. But that\u2019s because SMCI stock slipped 37% below the all-time high it hit in March. Now is the time for the next leg up.\n\nSuper Micro reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat Wall Street\u2019s top and bottom line estimates but didn\u2019t offer blow-the-doors-off guidance for the rest of the year. The stock market sold off its shares because SMCI\u2019s outlook for the fourth quarter said revenue would only triple from last year to as much as $5.8 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and workstations for data centers and other industries. The need for more capacity has hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building new data centers all over the country. There will be no lack of demand for Super Micro\u2019s equipment.\n\nSMCI stock earnings are expected to grow a whopping 62% every year for the next five years yet it trades at a fraction of that growth rate. That makes Super Micro Computer a tech stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another discounted tech stock to buy because it also has no end in sight to its growth potential. Like death and taxes, hackers and cybercrime will always be with us in the connected computer age. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says \u201chuman-initiated digital attacks\u201d are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palo Alto\u2019s stock is only up 1% in 2024. The market is worried that billings growth is slowing. It rose just 3% in the fiscal third quarter to $2.3 billion. But that resulted from the cybersecurity outfit offering program bundling discounts to existing customers.\n\nIt is also benefiting from customers consolidating where they spend their money on security. Rather than numerous different vendors, they are buying more Palo Alto modules under its new, single-platform offering. Particularly with the growth of AI, the cybersecurity leader has new program packages that offer superior protection.\n\nPalo Alto Network\u2019s lower price gives investors the chance to buy into this tech stock at a discount.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced wafer cleaning technologies and equipment (WFE) supplier ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another tech stock the market wrongly sold off. Shares are down 38% from its 52-week high though it remains 16% above where it started the year.\n\nPart of the reason for the pullback is ACM\u2019s market is declining, but only through this year. Analysts at Gartner predict the WFE industry will fall 4% this year after a 10% decline in 2023. However, starting in 2025, it will reverse and see 10% growth with significant gains continuing through 2027. It is easy to see why.\n\nDemand for computer chips is growing, especially due to the needs of AI. ACM Research\u2019s equipment is essential because it eliminates contaminants from wafer surfaces at the front end of the chip processing cycle. Chip manufacturers need pristine surfaces before they begin making the wafers.\n\nThe specialized nature of its equipment will be necessary as chip companies face secular growth trends. That should push ACMR stock to new heights in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Thanks to technology\u2019s exponential growth, we\u2019ve been hurtling through the digital age, making it easier for everyone to access the internet anytime and anywhere. With that ease of access, however, comes several threats. Personal information can be swiped off unsecured servers. Credit card details can be stolen. Lives can be ruined. That\u2019s why companies invest in cybersecurity\u2014and many investors invest in cybersecurity stocks, making it one of the most promising up-and-coming sectors in the market.\n\nAccording to a McKinsey report, annual cybersecurity attack damages by 2025 could reach\u00a0$10.5 trillion. This has made cybersecurity one of the fastest-growing sectors, as it is crucial in everyday life. So, today, let\u2019s look at three cybersecurity stocks leading the way. To get the list, I looked for companies with:\n\nMinimum 10% growth in full-year YOY EPS growth, A minimum buy rating from analysts, and a Positive YTD price return.\n\nThen, I sorted the list based on their full-year YOY earnings growth to ensure that I only focused on the companies that analysts love and the market buys and grows its earnings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsidered the leader in enterprise cyber security, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a global powerhouse that helps companies secure their network using artificial intelligence and automotive solutions.\n\nThe company provides its customers with a complete zero-trust solution that includes analytics, attack surface management, automation, and endpoint security solutions. It also has a joint venture with IBM to offer AI-powered security offerings.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s FY\u201923 numbers showed significant growth, with revenue increasing 25% year over year and reaching $6.9 billion. Basic EPS also saw a significant turnaround, from a loss of 90 cents to a $1.45 per share profit, representing a 261% growth.\n\nPANW stock is trading 2% higher YTD. Meanwhile, analysts rate it a strong buy, signifying its potential for further price growth.\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

The company is expanding its partnership with Google Cloud to build cloud-native cybersecurity to secure cloud intrusions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike reported a strong end to FY\u201924. Total and subscription revenue grew 36%, while ARR increased 34% YOY. GAAP net income also improved significantly, reaching $89.3 million from a loss of $183.2 million the previous year.\n\nAs a result, the company made a turnaround profit of $0.37 per share for the year. This is a strong comeback from the previous year\u2019s loss of $0.79 per share, representing a 147% improvement.\n\nCRWD stock is up 27.05% YTD and has a strong buy rating from 44 analysts. With a partnership with tech giant Alphabet and its Google Cloud and a turnaround performance for FY\u201923, it\u2019s a no-brainer that it\u2019s one of my top up-and-coming stocks to watch.\n\nAvePoint (AVPT)\n\nThe leader in enterprise-class cloud compliance solutions, AvePoint (NASDAQ:AVPT) is an IT and consulting firm that offers digital security, data handling and information technology operations under its cloud-native software platform.\n\nThe company\u2019s platform offers a combination of modularity in its cloud service architecture that seeks to resolve organizational operational challenges. AvePoint recently announced the addition of three new products to FedRAMP (moderate) authorization. These include AvePoint tyGraph, MaivenPoint Examena, and MaivenPoint Curricula, enabling organizations to remove the barriers to workplace innovation.\n\nLooking closer at its FY\u201923 report, AvePoint reported a 17% revenue growth year over year. This was primarily driven by its software-as-a-service (SaaS) segment, which reported an impressive 37% revenue increase. While the company is still operating at a loss, things are improving. 2023 ended with a $0.12 loss per share compared to last year\u2019s $0.22 loss.\n\nAVPT stock is up 14.18% YTD and has a strong buy rating from analysts.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Palo Alto Networks fair value estimate is US$474 Current share price of US$295 suggests Palo Alto Networks is potentially 38% undervalued Analyst price target for PANW is US$338 which is 29% below our fair value estimate\n\nHow far off is Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Fairly Valued?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$3.10b US$3.46b US$4.00b US$4.76b US$6.30b US$7.23b US$8.03b US$8.71b US$9.28b US$9.78b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x22 Analyst x27 Analyst x18 Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Est @ 14.74% Est @ 11.04% Est @ 8.44% Est @ 6.62% Est @ 5.35% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%  US$2.9k US$3.0k US$3.3k US$3.6k US$4.5k US$4.8k US$5.0k US$5.1k US$5.1k US$5.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$42b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.0%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$9.8b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$218b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$218b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$111b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$153b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$295, the company appears quite good value at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Palo Alto Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.999. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "content": "Cyberattacks are still wreaking global havoc. While it\u2019s a royal pain, it is creating big opportunities for some of the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks.\n\nAll because governments, companies, cities, hospitals, consumers, and schools are still grossly unprepared for attacks. Most recently, an attack on a contractor to England\u2019s National Health Service forced major hospitals in London to cancel operations, blood tests and appointments.\n\nTicketmaster was recently attacked, with hackers putting 500 million users\u2019 information up for sale online. As noted by TechRadar.com:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cThe database contained sensitive information on 560 million users, including payment data, but also containing people\u2019s names, postal addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, ticket sales and event details, order information, and even partial payment card data, for sale. The partial payment card data includes cardholder names, the last four digits of the cards, expiration dates, and some customer fraud details.\u201d\n\nUntil the cybersecurity threat diminishes, which is clearly not going to happen any time soon, you may want to invest in some of the top most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few months, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) ran from $265 to $320. Now back to $2.90, I\u2019d again use weakness as an opportunity.\n\nFor one, recent earnings were solid.\u00a0In its third quarter, EPS of $1.23 beat by seven cents. Revenue of $1.98 billion, up 15.1% year-over-year, beat by $10 million.\n\nMoving forward, the company expects fourth-quarter billings to range from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is a YOY growth range of 9% to 10%. It also expects to see total revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, as compared to estimates of $2.16 billion.\n\nTwo, analysts at Argus just raised their price target on PANW to $348 with a buy rating. The firm added that the \u201cCybersecurity environment is \u2018getting more toxic\u2019 as generative AI may be used for both good and ill, and Palo Alto continues to stand out from its sector peers with best-in-class technology and also a rapid product innovation cycle,\u201d as noted by TheFly.com.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), which slipped from a high of $251 to a low of $169.14. However, with negativity now priced in, I\u2019d use the weakness as an opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirst, it\u2019s a leader in zero trust and cloud cybersecurity trading at less than growth. Second, it just unveiled\u00a0multiple innovations to its \u201cAI Data Protection Platform that leverage the world\u2019s largest security cloud and the power of AI,\u201d as noted by the company.\n\nThat includes its \u201c\u2018Gen AI App Security\u2019, which offers context-rich user and risk correlation, providing insights into risky prompts, AI app usage and granular policy controls,\u201d says TechnologyMagazine.com. \u201cThis feature is crucial as the\u00a0adoption of AI technologies continues to accelerate, presenting new security challenges.\u201d\n\nRecent earnings haven\u2019t been too shabby either. In its third quarter, earnings per share of 88 cents beat estimates by 23 cents. Revenue of $553.2 million, up 32.1% YOY beat by $17.11 million. Moving forward, Zscaler forecasts revenue of $565 million to $567 million, exceeding estimates of $564.98 million for the fourth quarter.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nI\u2019d also use weakness as an opportunity in CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR).\n\nAfter failing at overhead resistance at $250, CYBR pulled back to $225, where it appears to have caught strong support. From here, I\u2019d like to see it initially retest $250.\n\nHelping, Baird analysts say \u201cRecent conversations with channel partners of CyberArk indicated a \u2018solid\u2019 start to the second quarter, while the acquisition of Venafi created a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 machine-identity security platform with \u2018significant\u2019 go-to-market synergies.\u201d The firm also has an outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $295.\n\nEarnings have been solid here, too. In its first quarter, the company posted EPS of 75 cents, which beat by 48 cents. Revenue of $221.6 million \u2013 up 37% year over year \u2013 beat by $8.38 million. The subscription portion of its annual recurring revenue (ARR) jumped 54% to $621 million year over year.

        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 12.6% in the pre-market session after the company reported a \"beat and raise\" quarter. CrowdStrike narrowly exceeded analysts' revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) expectations, indicating continued customer investment in its products. Remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading revenue indicator) came in even stronger, accelerating to 42% y/y from 37% last quarter and ahead of analysts' expectations. Looking ahead, CrowdStrike raised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, which beat Wall Street's projections. The outlook was impressive, given what management considers a \"challenging macro environment.\" Zooming out, this was a great quarter, showing that the company is staying on target.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 14 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 25.2% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability. Lastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. These results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 35.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $334.17 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $351.47 from May 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,762.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "title": "1 Magnificent Stock Down 78% to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "When it comes to corporate computer security, 93% of security operations centers within companies still rely on manual, human-led processes, according to Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW). Unfortunately, humans aren't equipped to deal with the high volume of cyberthreats faced by modern organizations, which means 23% of security alerts are left uninvestigated.\n\nThat creates unacceptable vulnerabilities, and artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful solutions to this problem. SentinelOne (NYSE: S) specializes in automated cybersecurity software driven by AI, which reduces the workload on human operators so that fewer incidents slip through.\n\nSentinelOne stock is trading 78% below its all-time high that was set during the 2021 tech frenzy. However, the company has done nothing but grow since then, so here's why it might be a great buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA comprehensive AI-based cybersecurity solution\n\nSentinelOne's Singularity platform is a unified cloud, identity, and endpoint security product to fulfill all of an organization's needs. AI powers a suite of unique features on Singularity that can identify, analyze, and rectify incidents autonomously, saving managers copious amounts of time.\n\nIts Storyline tool uses AI to rapidly summarize incidents into reports using natural language, inclusive of context so managers can get up to speed without spending hours on manual investigations. Then, Singularity's One-Click Remediation feature allows managers to instantly reverse unauthorized changes, restoring networks to their pre-breach state.\n\nSentinelOne enhanced Singularity further last year with the release of Purple AI, a chatbot-style assistant that can turn any security analyst into an expert. Using natural language, Purple AI can be prompted to hunt for new and emerging threats, uncover hidden vulnerabilities, and offer more detail about incidents that warrant deeper investigation. In fact, it can speed up some of those workflows by 80%, according to early adopters.\n\nDemand for SentinelOne's cybersecurity services remains strong, especially among large, complex organizations. During the recent fiscal 2025 first quarter, the company had 1,193 customers spending a minimum of $100,000 annually, which was a 30% increase from the year-ago period. Management also said the number of customers spending $1 million annually reached a new record high, although it didn't provide a specific figure.\n\nSentinelOne just delivered positive free cash flow for the first time\n\nSentinelOne generated $186 million in revenue during the first quarter, which was a 40% increase from the same period last year. That was a faster growth rate than two of the company's main rivals in the AI cybersecurity space: CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) boosted its revenue by 33% in its recent quarter, and Palo Alto Networks' revenue rose 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth of those competitors are much larger than SentinelOne, so it's harder for them to match its growth rate. However, it's a sign that SentinelOne is taking a small amount of market share.\n\nPlus, SentinelOne achieved an important profitability milestone during Q1. It generated $33.7 million in free cash flow, marking the first positive result in the company's history after years of losses. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP metric that strips out one-off and non-cash expenses like some property purchases and stock-based compensation, so it isn't technically \"true\" profitability, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, SentinelOne still lost $70.1 million during Q1, but that narrowed from its $106.9 million net loss in the year-ago period. Fast revenue growth combined with operating costs that only rose 5.1% contributed to the shrinking loss.\n\nWhy SentinelOne stock is a buy now\n\nSentinelOne shares fell 13% after the company released its Q1 report. Despite its strong results, investors were disappointed because the company slightly reduced its full-year revenue forecast for fiscal 2025. It now expects to deliver $811.5 million in revenue compared to previous guidance of $815 million as management weighs the potential for a broader economic slowdown.\n\nSentinelOne stock is down around 78% from its all-time high. To be frank, its valuation was ambitious back in 2021; it traded at an eye-watering price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 100. For context, CrowdStrike currently sports a P/S ratio of 25, and even that's expensive relative to many of its peers (Palo Alto's P/S ratio is 13.4).\n\nBut the decline in SentinelOne's stock price combined with its significant revenue growth since 2021 have brought its P/S ratio down to just 7.4, making it far cheaper than its competitors. CRWD PS Ratio Chart\n\nSentinelOne is checking all of the right boxes for investors. Its revenue is growing quickly, it's attracting high-spending customers, it's making progress toward true profitability, and it's heavily focused on AI innovation, which will make it a go-to cybersecurity provider for the long term. For those reasons, now might be a great time to buy the dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SentinelOne wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this security software maker have returned -2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Palo Alto belongs, has lost 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, indicating a change of -2.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +10.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 points to a change of +25.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5.9%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.18 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palo Alto is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PANW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $8 billion and $9.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +13.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +5.6%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Software Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Do you want to get rich? Obviously professional athletes and entertainment icons are doing well for themselves. But, not everyone has enough talent to become either one.\n\nFortunately for the rest of us, it's still possible to become a self-made millionaire even with just an ordinary income. The key is finding, buying, and then holding the right stocks. It's also worth mentioning that technology stocks have dished out a larger share of long-term gains. And that makes sense. These underlying companies are introducing the world's most revolutionary advances, after all.\n\nHere's a closer look at three software stocks -- a subset of the tech sector -- that could help make you millionaire if you're willing to give them enough time.\n\n1. C3.ai\n\nYou're probably aware of the recent rise of several artificial intelligence (AI) platforms like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), or what Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) now refers to as Copilot. You may have even tinkered with some of these tools yourself just to see what they can do. And if you have, you've likely been casually impressed.\n\nWhat you've probably not seen, however, is a practical, widespread commercial use for generalized AI-powered chatbots.\n\nJust understand that platforms like ChatGPT or Gemini aren't the only artificial intelligence tools available. There are higher-level, business-oriented AI platforms out there that are already generating revenue.\n\nC3.ai(NYSE: AI) is one of the bigger names behind such enterprise-caliber solutions. And it's had no problem selling them. Oil and gas giant Shell, for instance, uses C3's tech to predict which pieces or components of its physical infrastructure need maintenance, meaning less downtime due to surprise failures. The U.S. Air Force employs a similar program aimed at ensuring more of its aircraft remain airworthy. The company's software was even used to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe thing is, most enterprise customers are still just learning about the full potential of artificial intelligence, and what all it can do. Most of this business's growth is ahead rather than behind it. Precedence Research predicts the global AI software market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 23% through 2032, as more and more organizations begin paying for access to such tools. C3's top line is expected to grow to the tune of 23% this year, and another 22% next year.\n\nYes, the company's recent post-earnings surge makes the idea of stepping into the stock now a little bit intimidating. Don't be intimidated though. C3 shares are still much nearer their all-time lows hit in late 2022 than their all-time highs reached in late 2020. There's still plenty of room for more upside.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks\n\nFor almost as long as personal computers have existed, criminals have sought to exploit their vulnerabilities. And, for as long as computers and the networks they're a part of are going to exist into the future, nefarious folks will continue exploiting them.\n\nThe growing usage of computers (and smartphones) is actually creating more chances for cybercrime to be committed. According to the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation reports of online fraud were up 10% last year, leading to a 22% increase in monetary losses. All told, the FBI estimates 2023's cybercrime losses reached $12.5 billion in the U.S. alone.\n\nEnter Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW). It's one of the outfits helping the world defend from digital threats. Firewalls, Internet of Things (IoT) support, malware defense, data protection, and secure remote logins are just some of the services in its lineup. And it's good at what it does. Technology market research outfit Gartner rates its endpoint protection platform as one of the best ones available, for instance.\n\nAnyone keeping tabs on this company and/or this stock likely knows this superiority hasn't mattered much of late. While shares were deep into record-high territory in February immediately before the release of the company's fiscal Q2 results, dialed-back top-line guidance for the full year spooked investors, leading to a sharp post-earnings plunge. The stock's recovery effort since then hasn't gotten much traction.\n\nTake a step back and look at the bigger picture, though. This company's revenue is still expected to improve by 16% this year, and then another 14% next fiscal year, with comparable growth in the cards at least through 2028. Earnings are expected to grow at an even faster clip for the time frame. That's a bit faster than the near-10% yearly growth Inkwood Research foresees for the worldwide cybersecurity business through 2032. But Palo Alto Networks is positioned to capture more than its fair share of this growth.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nLast, but certainly not least, add Microsoft to your list of millionaire-making software stocks.\n\nIt's an oldie but a goodie. Microsoft is, of course, the original titan of the software market. Its Windows operating system is a key reason personal computers began becoming commonplace back in the 1990s, although its personal productivity and entertainment software certainly helped usher in the PC era.\n\nMicrosoft is now also the name behind the Bing search engine, owns LinkedIn, offers cloud computing infrastructure services, and makes the Xbox video game console -- just to name a few of its other ventures.\n\nIt's still predominantly a software company, however, and an important one. Data from GlobalStats indicates that its Windows operating system is installed on nearly three-fourths of the world's personal computers. Its office productivity software like Word and Excel still enjoy a great deal of market share.\n\nIt's the way the software business is changing though -- and the way Microsoft is changing with it -- that makes this stock such a must-have for most portfolios.\n\nSee, rather than outright buying and installing software out of a box (from a disc) on a one-time basis, more and more consumers and corporations are \"renting\" access to cloud-based versions of these programs. Although these monthly and annual subscription fees are relatively modest, that's actually a competitive advantage. That's because their cost is low enough that customers willingly stick with these subscriptions for a long, long time. This lowers the company's ultimate marketing costs while at the same time raising the reliability and predictability of its revenue.\n\nThat being said, perhaps Microsoft's most meaningful growth engine is the one that's seen the least. That's its cloud computing business. Although the company's still trailing Amazon's cloud market share of 31%, numbers from Synergy Research Group indicate Microsoft's cloud computing business is growing faster than any other provider's. And with a 24% share, it's not inconceivable that Microsoft could become the world's top cloud service provider in the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best AI System Integrator Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "System integrators combine multiple technology products, usually made by a variety of companies, on behalf of clients. Among the world\u2019s best-known system integrators are Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and India\u2019s Wipro (NYSE:WIT). Many companies around the world are looking to utilize AI. Indeed, according to a recent survey by Gartner, 46% of chief information officers globally are seeking to implement AI systems, but only 4% have experience with launching AI. As a result, many if not most of the companies which decide to utilize AI on a wide scale for the first time are likely to hire system integrators. For investors who want to exploit this trend, here are the three best AI systems integrator stocks to buy now.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is known for creating and marketing its own software which enables companies to easily implement AI. However, C3.ai also helps its clients utilize systems from other vendors, including third party data, sensor networks and applications from the major cloud infrastructure firms, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). As a result, I view C3.ai as a system integrator.\n\nThe firm has accumulated an impressive list of customers, including Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the U.S. Air Force, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Raytheon Technologies. And C3.ai has become very ubiquitous in federal agencies, as it closed 65 deals with Washington last year alone. What\u2019s more, the company\u2019s revenue from the federal government jumped over 100% last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn May 29, C3.ai reported very impressive Q4 results as its revenue jumped 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $86.6 million. Moreover, its net cash used in operating activities dropped to $62.36 million from $115.69 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) specializes in carrying out system integration on behalf of federal agencies. AI is becoming a major revenue generator for the company. Indeed, it estimates about 5.6% of its revenue, or about $600 million, during fiscal year 2023 was related to AI. The firm is looking to nearly double that number to $1 billion in the next couple of years.\n\nSince the Biden Administration recently ordered federal agencies to step up their use of AI, I believe that Booz Allen can meet its goal, greatly boosting its financial results and BAH stock in the process.\n\nThe company reported strong overall Q4 2023 results as its top line climbed 14% year-over-year to $2.77 billion. Meanwhile, its operating income nearly doubled to $254 million versus $138.8 million YOY.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooz Allen\u2019s high leverage to the federal government which is poised to rapidly implement AI make Booz one of the best AI system integrator stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIn recent weeks, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made several key deals that should enable it to meaningfully expand its AI integration business.\n\nOn May 8, the company disclosed that it would partner with European software giant SAP (NYSE:SAP) to create new generative AI and cloud solutions. Specifically, IBM will add AI functionality to SAP\u2019s offerings. The agreement should lead to IBM getting many new deals to help SAP\u2019s many customers learn how to effectively integrate and utilize these new capabilities. Indeed, the companies noted that IBM\u2019s consultants will \u201ctransform the way they deliver SAP solutions to boost productivity and mitigate risk by leveraging generative AI.\u201d\n\nOn May 15, IBM announced that its consultants would begin integrating Palo Alto\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) AI-powered security products to customers. Given the high popularity of Palo Alto\u2019s IT security tools, the deal should be a positive needle mover for IBM.\n\nFinally, IBM recently said that it would buy software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). According to Bank of America, the deal will make IBM\u2019s software for private clouds more appealing. As a result, IBM will likely get more cloud migration deals, many of which c0uld also include AI integration opportunities, going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Palo Alto Networks Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "content": "In the last year, many Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Chairman & CEO, Nikesh Arora, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$17m worth of shares at a price of US$226 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$295, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. This single sale was just 13% of Nikesh Arora's stake.\n\nInsiders in Palo Alto Networks didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\n\nDoes Palo Alto Networks Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Palo Alto Networks insiders own about US$899m worth of shares (which is 0.9% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Palo Alto Networks Tell Us?\n\nThere haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Palo Alto Networks insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Palo Alto Networks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course Palo Alto Networks may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Should You Invest in Palo Alto (PANW) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Palo Alto Networks (PANW).\n\nPalo Alto currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 43 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 43 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 67.4% and 4.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PANW Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PANW\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Palo Alto here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Palo Alto, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs PANW Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Palo Alto, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $5.50.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Palo Alto. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Palo Alto may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could 10X Your Money Over the Next Decade",
        "content": "The pursuit of 10X growth stocks is a quest that captures the imagination of every investor. Getting in on the ground floor of transformative companies can not only provide you with bragging rights but make you extremely rich.\n\nIdentifying these opportunities can be a difficult endeavor but it is certainly worth the shot. Investors must carefully select these companies at the forefront of emerging technologies such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and financial technology. Moreover, successful growth stocks typically have visionary leadership, a scalable business model and a solid track record. While the pursuit of these high-reward investments comes with risks, diligent research and a diversified portfolio can mitigate potential downsides.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top three 10X growth stocks to buy for outsized returns!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions globally.

Net income skyrocketed 159% YOY to $279 million, or 79 per share. The company continues to execute on its long-term strategy while driving profitable growth. With strong forward guidance for the 2024 fiscal year, PANW stock remains one of the top 10X growth stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is finally getting the love it deserves on Wall Street. Its users have been growing tremendously and its recent profitable quarters are a very positive sign.\n\nSpotify revolutionized the music industry, transforming how we consume and interact with music. The company\u2019s streaming platform boasts a vast library of songs, podcasts and audio content, catering to a wide global audience. As more consumers embrace the new digital age of music streaming, Spotify is well-positioned to capitalize on this demand. Additionally, their platform is growing exponentially and is on pace to reach 1 billion monthly active users (MAU) in the next few years. In its first first quarter, revenue increased 20% YOY to $3.6 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) swelled 184% YOY to 97 cents per share with operating margins up to 27.6%. Spotify is now demonstrating its ability to grow profitably and sees a tremendous amount of potential in emerging markets. If you\u2019re a believer in the long-term growth of digital streaming, SPOT stock is a no-brainer buy in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nPayoneer (PAYO)\n\nPayoneer (NASDAQ:PAYO) has been on a tear in the last month.

Its platform offers a wide range of services, including payment processing, multi-currency accounts, and working capital solutions.

        "title": "7 Surefire Stocks to Buy Each Time You Get a Paycheck",
        "content": "Nothing is guaranteed in the market, but I have good personal conviction in several \u201cSurefire\u201d stocks to buy regularly. This is mostly due to how sticky their revenue and profits are, alongside their stable and consistent performance in the stock market up until now. Not only that, these stocks have also delivered solid growth and will likely keep compounding in the long run.\n\nI think boosting your holdings in some of these seven surefire stocks is a good idea each time you get a paycheck. These businesses will likely compound your money faster than the broader market if they keep executing as they have. Let\u2019s explore the stocks to buy regularly:\n\nAmetek (AME) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Ametek, Inc. (AME) logo\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMETEK (NYSE:AME) is a company that makes electronic devices and electromechanical tools. Even with economic challenges, it posted decent results this earnings season. Their sales grew 9% YOY, reaching $1.74 billion. However, this actually missed estimates by 2.4%. So why am I putting this in a list of surefire stocks? It\u2019s because Ametek still expects revenue to grow in the low double-digit percentage range for all of 2024. Besides, the company has slightly raised its earnings per share (EPS) guidance. The previous EPS guidance range was $6.70 to $6.85, and the new updated guidance range is $6.74 to $6.86. Bookings and backlog are swelling, too.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amtek bookings and backlog\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAMETEK had a record operating income of $446 million, up 10%, with operating margins at 25.7%.\n\nThe Electronic Instruments segment did very well, with operating margins at 30.5%. This company is a cash cow with healthy growth. This positions them well to keep expanding by buying other companies, and the revenue growth in Q1 was actually driven mostly by their new acquisitions. The stock also had a correction of around 9% recently, so I think it\u2019s a great buying opportunity right now. It also has a small 0.64% dividend yield, which makes me think it is one of the best surefire stocks to buy regularly.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company. The company reported strong results for the third quarter of 2024, with revenue growing 15.3% YOY to almost $2 billion, surpassing estimates by $17.86 million. EPS of $1.32 also exceeded expectations by 7 cents. The growth so far has been outstanding here. PANW financials growth\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe Palo Alto Networks is well-positioned to benefit from the growing need for robust security solutions. Cyber-attacks will forever be a problem, especially with nation-state actors taking advantage of weaknesses at a large scale. These attacks are also being paired up with AI, which Palo Alto Networks specializes in through its suite of AI-focused security products. The stock has been one of the most consistent names in the AI and software field, up 382% over the past five years. The stock has dipped a little recently, but I think it presents a good entry point for the long run, as PANW has already started to bottom out.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeico (HEI) a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHEICO Corporation (NYSE:HEI) operates in the aerospace and defense industries. HEI stock has been one of the most stable and consistent stocks over the past few years. Moreover, the trend has only been better, with the stock up almost 37% in the past year.\n\nThis company has delivered very good results this earnings season. Total revenue jumped an amazing 44% YOY to $896 million, while operating income soared 39% to a new high.\n\nThey posted 12% organic growth in their Flight Support Group, driven by strong demand for replacement parts and repair services after planes land. The booming aerospace industry is nothing to scoff at. Look at how companies like FTAI Aviation (NASDAQ:FTAI) have been performing recently.\n\nManagement has done an exceptional job here\u2013smoothly integrating recent acquisitions like Wencor\u2013which are already paying off. With air travel picking up and steady defense spending, I believe HEICO is set up for sustained growth going forward. The stock should continue delivering consistent gains.\n\nIDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) ZOM stock: Persian cat with veterinarian doctor at vet clinic\n\nSource: didesign021 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) provides diagnostic testing and services for pets and livestock at veterinary clinics. The company reported subpar results for the first quarter due to some broader economic headwinds, with 7% growth in revenue slightly missing, though an impressive 9% EPS growth surpassed estimates. The most concerning thing was the FY24 guidance being lowered, though I do not think you should worry too much about near-term trends. The company is having ongoing success in placing premium diagnostic instruments, an 11% rise in recurring software and imaging revenue, and the ability to expand profit margins. IDEXX profit margins\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile severe January weather and softer demand for veterinary appointments presented difficulties, IDEXX saw 6.5% growth in recurring U.S. diagnostic testing revenue, significantly outpacing the 2.3% drop in overall clinic visits.\n\nI believe IDEXX remains well-positioned as a high-quality long-term investment that can produce sustainable growth and returns for shareholders, even in a more challenging overall business environment. Analysts expect both revenue and EPS growth to accelerate in 2025. Indeed, I think this is one of the most surefire stocks to buy regularly.\n\nGenerac Holdings (GNRC) Generac GP7500E 7500-Watt Gasoline during Fundraising Event in Olney, MD\n\nSource: Lissandra Melo / Shutterstock.com\n\nGenerac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC) is a leading global innovator of energy technology and power product solutions. This stock has not had the best historical performance. The past few years have been very volatile, and the stock delivered explosive gains in the early post-COVID era, which were then wiped out in 2022. That said, I still think this is a surefire stock, as GNRC has been performing well since.\n\nQ1 earnings exceeded expectations thanks to higher commercial and industrial shipments, combined with favorable input cost management. Revenue increased slightly YOY to $889 million, with residential product revenue growing 2%. However, the top line still missed estimates by $3.4 million.\n\nWhile global commercial and industrial product sales dipped slightly, a robust increase in shipments to industrial distributors helped offset softness in some rental and telecom markets. Generac\u2019s has been significantly strengthening margins and improving free cash flow. Analysts expect this trend to continue, with EPS expected to more than double in the next four years. GNRC eps estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAlthough home consultations declined from a solid prior year, they still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. With Generac making ongoing investments to engage new customer segments and expand their installer partnerships, I believe they are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term home standby power opportunity ahead.\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (MPWR) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMonolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) has built a strong business designing high-performance power solutions for its customers. I\u2019m consistently impressed by how MPWR delivers solid results each quarter, even when the broader economy is facing uncertainty. In Q1, their revenue reached $457.9 million, which was nearly $13 million above what analysts had predicted. Their earnings per share of $2.81 also beat the forecasts by 17 cents. To me, this looks like one of the top surefire stocks to buy regularly.\n\nWhile management is keeping a close eye on the potential challenges of the second half, given limited visibility, I\u2019m encouraged by the strong engagement they continue to have across all the markets they serve. Their expanding list of design wins with new customers. MPWR is diversifying its supply chain on a global scale, which will serve it well as economic conditions eventually improve.\n\nOne area they are gaining share in is enterprise data centers, which now make up about a third of total sales. With that in mind, I believe MPWR remains a solid pick for the long run. The stock is up over 46% over the past year, which is impressive given the environment. It also comes with a 0.66% dividend yield.\n\nParker-Hannifin (PH)\n\nParker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH) is a global leader in motion and control technologies. An illustration of various clean energy symbols; a faucet with water flowing to the earth, a windmill and solar panel with a plug leading to an electric car. clean energy stocks\n\nSource: RoseStudio / Shutterstock\n\nThe company posted $5.1 billion in total sales in Q3 2024 and 1.2% organic growth. I\u2019m especially pleased by the record adjusted operating margin of 24.7% across all segments, a full 1.5 percentage points higher than last year.\n\nThe strong demand from their aerospace business has clearly provided a significant boost, and I expect that positive momentum to carry forward. Now that management has opted to raise full-year projections, I believe Parker-Hannifin is well-equipped to deliver sustainable growth and returns for shareholders in the long run, especially due to the cash flow here. Parker-Hannifin cash flow\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe dividend yield here is 1.23%. This stock is up over 60% in the past year, but you should steer clear as a near-term correction could happen after the recent rally. Regardless, it is still one of the best stocks to buy regularly for the long run.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Technology stocks continue to outperform and power the market higher. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq Composite index that is laden with tech securities is up 15%, bringing its 12-month gain to 30%. That\u2019s ahead of both the benchmark S&P 500 index and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. But while the sector as a whole continues to outperform, there are several overhyped tech stocks that are lagging behind.\n\nThe main reason why some tech stocks are in the red while the rest of the market is in the green is that the companies behind the securities have failed to deliver on the promises they made. Financial results have missed targets, forward guidance has been lowered and new products haven\u2019t materialized when expected. This has hurt investor sentiment and led analysts to revise their outlooks downward for these stocks.\n\nTo avoid falling victim to overhyped tech stocks, investors should take a good look at each of the companies on this list. Paying attention to current financials and where a company may be heading in the future can prevent costly investment mistakes in this highly volatile market segment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nHas any tech company overpromised and underdelivered as much as microchip and semiconductor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)? The company just delivered the latest in a series of disappointing quarterly financial reports, sending its share price down 8% as a result. Intel continues to struggle as it pivots to becoming a microchip foundry and not just a designer of chips and semiconductors. Not even $8.5 billion in funding through the U.S. government\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act has helped the company.\n\nEarlier this year, Intel unveiled a new artificial intelligence (AI) microchip called the Gaudi 3 that the company says can be used to train and deploy big AI models and chatbots. In launching the Gaudi 3 chip, Intel said that it is over twice as power-efficient and one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) competing H100 microchip. Investors seem skeptical of the claims and that Intel will be able to deliver with the new chip.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), INTC stock is down 35% and one of the worst-performing securities listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index. It might be one of the most well-known names in the industry, but it\u2019s also one of the top overhyped tech stocks right now.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nVideo game maker Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) saw its share price plunge 22% after the video game developer delivered forward guidance that fell far short of Wall Street expectations. The one-day drop in the company\u2019s share price was the largest since 2022 and brings RBLX stock to a loss of 24% on the year. Since going public in March 2021, Roblox stock has fallen 53%. Roblox did manage to report strong first-quarter financial results.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company behind the popular online video game platform posted a Q1 loss of 43 cents, which beat a loss of 53 cents expected on Wall Street. Revenue totaled $923.8 million, up 19% from a year earlier and above analyst estimates of $919 million. But the forward guidance sank the stock. Roblox said it expects revenue of $870 million to $900 million in the current second quarter, below analyst calls for $929 million.\n\nAt an investor day last year, Roblox\u2019s management team said they planned to deliver 20% revenue growth over the next few years. Those growth projections now seem in doubt.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDisappointing earnings are becoming a pattern at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company\u2019s share price just fell 8% after it yet again reported quarterly billings that missed Wall Street targets. Specifically, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 billings for the year\u2019s first three months came in at $2.33 billion, just missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.34 billion. While the latest print was not as bad as the previous one that really torpedoed PANW stock, it wasn\u2019t the comeback investors wanted.\n\nAnalysts and investors see the disappointing billings as a sign of reduced corporate spending on cybersecurity solutions, creating near-term headwinds for Palo Alto Networks. Corporate America is spending less on cybersecurity as firms struggle with inflation and an uncertain economic outlook, said Palo Alto executives. For the entire year, the company expects billings of $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion. That guidance is slightly lower than a previous range of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion.\n\nPANW stock is up 7.5% on the year but trading 18% below its 52-week high and trailing rival cybersecurity firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 78% of the company",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Palo Alto Networks' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Palo Alto Networks.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nPalo Alto Networks already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Palo Alto Networks' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Palo Alto Networks is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 4.0% of the stock.\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that Palo Alto Networks, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$981m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Palo Alto Networks. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted  2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks you should be aware of, and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Palo Alto Networks (PANW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PANW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Palo Alto Networks' main business drivers.\n\nSanta Clara, CA-based Palo Alto Networks, Inc. offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe company's next generation firewall products deliver natively integrated application, user, and content visibility and control through its operating system, hardware and software architecture. It serves the enterprise network security market, which includes Firewall, Unified Threat Management (UTM), Web Gateway, Intrusion Detection and Prevention, and Virtual Private Network technologies.\r\n\r\nThrough its products and subscription services, Palo Alto provides integrated protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure. Its solutions incorporate application-specific integrated circuits, hardware architecture, operating system, and associated security and networking functions.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s network security gateways protect customer data, reduce security complexities and lower total cost of ownership. Customers can implement their security policies on traffic between internal networks and the Internet, as well as between internal and private networks shared with partners.\r\n\r\nThe company has a single operating segment. However, the company announces its revenues from products and services separately. For fiscal 2023, the company reported total revenues of $6.89 billion, which grew 25.3% year over year.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto\u2019s fiscal 2023 revenues from its products increased 15.8% year over year to $1.58 billion. Revenues from subscriptions and support grew 28.4% to $5.31 billion.\r\n\r\nFurther, Palo Alto operates across different geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APAC).\r\n\r\nThe company faces competition from large companies like Cisco and Juniper, independent security vendors such as Symantec, Check Point, Fortinet, FireEye and several other small companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Palo Alto Networks a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2014 would be worth $13,860.28, or a 1,286.03% gain, as of May 28, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 177.46% and gold's return of 77.20% over the same time frame.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PANW.\n\nPalo Alto has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security. PANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments. However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.61%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "The Nasdaq rally is in full swing after a brief pause in April as concerns over inflation and uncertainty over rate cuts grew. However, Nasdaq has been the least impacted by these and has continued its dream run after a solid 2023.\n\nOn May 24, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at an all-time high of 16,920.79. This was Nasdaq\u2019s 12th all-time high of 2024. In fact, Nasdaq has been driving the broader market rally since the past year.\n\nRally Driven by AI Optimism\n\nThe Nasdaq has gained 12.7% year to date after rallying 43.4% in 2023 to record its best year since 2023. The rally is primarily being driven by the optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI.\n\nThe AI revolution is being spearheaded by NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, the largest manufacturer of generative AI chipsets, which has led several big and small tech players to explore the space.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s robust first-quarter earnings have further fueled the expectations of investors surrounding AI and its potential. Several experts believe that AI is still in its nascent stage, and its full potential is yet to be realized.\n\nThis has seen other tech companies shift focus toward AI.\n\nAdditionally, the advancement of smart devices is driving the expansion of the AI space, as they necessitate computing and learning capabilities for tasks such as face detection, image recognition and video analytics.\n\nThese functions demand high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphics processors and solutions, all of which foster favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry's growth.\n\nMoreover, while uncertainties about rate cuts have caused concerns, the Federal Reserve stated earlier this month that further interest rate hikes are unlikely. High-interest rates typically have a negative impact on growth assets like technology stocks, and the Federal Reserve's comments were well received by investors.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation,Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 893.7% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.7% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare and others.\n\nAlphabet\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.4% over the past 60 days. GOOGL presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 7.5% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide.

        "content": "Cybersecurity stocks to buy benefit from an incredibly cynical narrative: when bad things happen in the digital realm, the bullish case for the aforementioned sector rises.\n\nGiven this correlation, it\u2019s easy to see why some folks have a conspiratorial view of the cybersecurity ecosystem. Not only that, the underlying narrative isn\u2019t accretive or productive. In other words, the expenditures in protection against digital breaches don\u2019t forward the underlying business. Rather, they allow the business to stay in business.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly a sexy tagline. However, an ounce of prevention is well worth a pound of cure in this ecosystem. On that note, below are cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Santa Clara, California, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) falls under the infrastructure software industry. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s top cybersecurity solutions providers, offering firewall appliances and software. Palo Alto brings to the table Panorama, a security management solution for the global control of network security platform as a virtual or physical appliance.\n\nWith no shortage of worldwide threats, PANW stock enjoys a reliable growth trek. Unsurprisingly, the underlying company\u2019s financials are robust and consistent. Between its fiscal second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, it posted an average positive earnings surprise of 12.35%. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), Palo Alto generated net income of $2.45 billion on sales of $7.79 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe earnings per share will rise 25.4% to $5.57. Further, revenue may reach $8 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 16.1%. For fiscal 2025, EPS could expand again to $6.21 with a consensus sales target of $9.12 billion.\n\nWith the threat profile constantly rising, these are believable numbers. Therefore, PANW ranks among the cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Israel, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR), along with its subsidiaries develops, markets and sells software-based identity security solutions and services in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Africa and other regions. One of its mainline products is Privileged Access Manager, which provides risk-based credential security and session access. With enterprises becoming increasingly vulnerable to data breaches, CyberArk should see sustained long-term demand.\n\nIndeed, that\u2019s not really much of a forecast. In the past four quarters since Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at nearly 112%. It must be said that over the TTM period, CyberArk posted a net loss of $26 million. However, this dynamic could change soon. Revenue during this time landed at $811.73 million. Further, the quarterly revenue growth rate (year-over-year) comes in at a robust 37%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to rise more than 80% to hit $2.02. On the top line, the metric could reach $939.33 million. If so, that would represent a 24.9% lift from last year\u2019s tally of $751.89 million. Thus, CYBR ranks among the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) provides cybersecurity and convergence of networking and security solutions worldwide. Primarily, it specializes in network firewall solutions along with encrypted applications. Relevant for the times, the enterprise also offers data loss prevention services and zero trust network access along with cloud security.\n\nOne of the criticisms regarding FTNT is that it hasn\u2019t performed as well as other cybersecurity stocks to buy. For example, over the past 52 weeks, FTNT stock dipped almost 9%. On the other hand, shares of Palo Alto Networks returned nearly 55%. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be right to dismiss FTNT altogether. After all, the underlying company is consistent, posting an average earnings surprise of 14.38% in the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Fortinet posted net income of $1.2 billion on revenue of $5.4 billion. Quarterly sales growth presently stands at 7.2%. For fiscal 2024, experts forecast 8.6% growth in the bottom line to $1.77 EPS. On the top line, sales could reach $5.8 billion, representing a 9.3% YOY lift.\n\nFinally, trading at 8.9X trailing-year revenue, it\u2019s at a discount to PANW (14.62X) and CYBR (12.88X).\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Okta Earnings: What To Look For From OKTA\n\nIdentity management software maker Okta (OKTA) will be reporting results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what to look for.\n\nOkta beat analysts' revenue expectations by 3% last quarter, reporting revenues of $605 million, up 18.6% year on year. It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' revenue and EPS estimates.\n\nIs Okta a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Okta's revenue to grow 16.7% year on year to $604.5 million, slowing from the 24.8% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.55 per share. Okta Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Okta has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 4% on average.\n\nLooking at Okta's peers in the cybersecurity segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Palo Alto Networks delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 15.3%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Varonis reported revenues up 6.2%, in line with consensus estimates. Palo Alto Networks traded down 3.8% following the results while Varonis's stock price was unchanged.\n\nRead our full analysis of Palo Alto Networks's results here and Varonis's results here.\n\nInvestors in the cybersecurity segment have had steady hands going into earnings, with share prices flat over the last month. Okta is up 4.4% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $112.8 (compared to the current share price of $97.29).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "3 Sorry Cloud Computing Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can",
        "content": "Though the cloud computing sector has seen generous growth over the last five years, some analysts have wondered if the market is overvalued. However, there is no simple answer to this question, as the concept of cloud computing can refer to any number of companies that provide an offsite technical solution for customers. With the industry\u2019s potential projected to grow to $2.3 trillion by 2032, it\u2019s important to know which cloud computing stocks to sell and which to buy.\n\nCurrently, some business analysts believe the future of cloud computing is industry-specific, meaning that the companies with lucrative niches are likely to go the furthest. It also means that companies with less adaptable and relevant business models over time are likely to suffer long-term. Thus, the three stocks mentioned in this article might have upsides in the short term but are likely to remain stable as the cloud service industry progresses.\n\nWorkiva (WK) Button with the word risk pointing between medium and high level, 3D render suitable for risk management or decision-making process situation. represents risk tolerance\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen looking at the big picture regarding Workiva (NYSE:WK) the stock is up 56% over the last five years. This is despite its lack of profitability over the same time frame and reality might finally be catching up to it. The company\u2019s cloud-based software is essentially a one-stop shop for financial reporting, audit preparation and risk management and has been the focal point of the hype around Workiva.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere are two ways of looking at the company\u2019s current trajectory. First, the company could be undergoing a period of price correction, as many of the cloud-based and computing-centric companies are now under the microscope due to whispers of an artificial intelligence bubble. Second, the company could be overvalued and in a generous downturn as it continually struggles to generate income.\n\nThough its software-as-a-service model can be lucrative over time, its original investors could lose patience soon. Thus, it might be best to start considering Workvia as one of the cloud computing stocks to sell.\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM) Zoom (ZM) logo on a building\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a brief moment during the remote-work paradigm of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) was the future of productivity. After all, between 2020 and 2021, nearly everyone\u2019s remote working experience involved the company\u2019s video call application. Yet, the reality of market saturation might be setting in for ZM stock as the company faces a stagnating market for video call software.\n\nBeyond the market slowdown, Zoom now faces major competition from established industry giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) with their respective Teams and Webex software. Thus, the company\u2019s stock could be approaching another selloff wave as investors recognize its uncompetitive position.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, if you were one of the investors who had initially invested in the stock during its peak run in 2020, there\u2019s likely no chance of seeing performance like that again. These days, Zoom is a shell of its former self simply because it faces competitors who can price video call products more competitively due to diversification.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis last pick is somewhat mercurial in terms of potential, as it relies on a very specific subset of business to prosper amidst a period of tumultuous growth. As a cloud cyber-security company, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) could have a long runway ahead of it or a slow decay.\n\nCurrently, the stock commands strong buy ratings from several analysts. However, its overvaluation looms. This is based on factors such as repeated quarterly losses amidst an increasingly competitive market with competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nMoreover, Baird recently adjusted its price target from $265 to $260. While not an excessive decrease and still representing an outperformance rating, it does signal caution ahead of Zscaler\u2019s next earnings report. Thus, the best time to sell could be after its Q3 earnings report, should investor optimism continue to drive the stock up before a correction cycle.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Cybersecurity will be a vital part of the digital economy moving forward. Companies are financially incentivized to use the best security tools to protect their data and systems. Did you know the average breach can cost a company nearly $4.5 million? That's according to an annual study by IBM.\n\nHowever, legacy products like antivirus software often don't do the job anymore. That's where next-generation solutions come into the picture. Investors have a variety of cybersecurity stocks to choose from, but after some due diligence, three emerged as potential long-term winners.\n\nHere are the three cybersecurity stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe firewall has been critical to security for years, and that's where Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) specializes. A firewall is like the security detail at a party checking the guest list to ensure only the invited people get in. Firewalls monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic, looking for anything that doesn't belong. Palo Alto Networks' firewall security is top-notch; third-party firms like Gartner's prestigious Magic Quadrant rankings have named it a leader in its category.\n\nToday, Palo Alto Networks has over 70,000 active customers and is growing by expanding its product offerings to include additional security categories on two other platforms. That gives the company three platforms: Network Security, Cloud Security, and Security Operations. Currently, just half of the company's customers use two of three platforms, and just 13% use all three, so there are opportunities to cross-sell. PANW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPalo Alto is one of the largest security companies, with over $7.5 billion in annual revenue. Earnings have exploded in recent years, and analysts believe profits will continue to grow, averaging 22% annualized for the next three to five years. The company's large customer base and size give it a strong hand as it competes for customers' security budget dollars over the next decade.\n\n2. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nEndpoint security is one of the focal points of next-generation solutions, and CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) is quickly proving to be a winner in this arena. Endpoint security protects devices on a network (endpoints), such as computers or mobile devices. CrowdStrike uses artificial intelligence (AI) and a cloud-based platform to provide instantaneous and effective protection against potential threats. The platform learns from threat encounters, meaning the product improves as it grows and encounters more threats.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike makes it remarkably easy to cross-sell its product because it sells different products and services as modules. Customers can pick and choose what they want for their needs. CrowdStrike has launched modules over time as it expands into new categories. Today, 27% of CrowdStrike's customers use at least seven modules, and the number of those using at least eight has more than doubled since the end of 2023. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nA combination of customer growth and cross-selling has fueled tremendous growth; revenue has multiplied from $400 million to $3 billion in just four years. The business has also reached the size where earnings start rocketing higher, which gives the stock a bright outlook for long-term investors. Analysts believe CrowdStrike's earnings will grow by an annual average of 22% over the next three to five years.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nTech giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't the first name you think of when discussing cybersecurity growth stocks. It's also not growing as quickly as the others on this list. But what Microsoft does offer is a much higher floor because it's a highly diversified company with leading businesses in several industries. Microsoft Defender's security product is embedded within Windows and Office software.\n\nLooking to sleep well at night with your investments? Look no further. Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike are drops in the bucket compared to what Microsoft generates each year. The company has an ironclad balance sheet with a AAA rating, one of only two publicly traded companies with such status. It's also the only company on this list that pays dividends, which Microsoft has raised for over 20 consecutive years. MSFT Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nMicrosoft Defender will never be the focal point for shareholders, but that's OK. The stock can give investors cybersecurity exposure with the bonus of enterprise software, cloud, gaming, and more. Despite its enormous size, Microsoft is still growing. Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by 16% annually for the next three to five years, making Microsoft a jack-of-all-trades investors can confidently hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Top 5 Nasdaq Composite Laggards of 2024 Likely to Gather Pace",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4%, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a setback in April. However, Nasdaq Composite has regained momentum in May.\n\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 14.6% compared with an 11.9% gain of the S&P 500 and 3.6% of the Dow. On May 23, the Nasdaq Composite recorded an all-time high of 16,996.39. The next day, the index posted an all-time closing high of 16,920.79.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory. They also need low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\r\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nA Few Nasdaq Composite Laggers\n\nDespite a dream run of the tech-laden index, a few large-cap stocks have provided negative returns year to date. A handful of those stocks currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank. These stocks are likely to regain momentum in 2024 as steadily dwindling inflation coupled with a low interest rate regime are expected to help reviving their businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed laggards of year to date with strong potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDatadog Inc. DDOG has been benefiting from strength in customer demand for offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management. DDOG had 3,340 customers with an annual run rate of $100K or more at the end of the last reported quarter.\n\nDDOG\u2019s dollar-based retention rate was in the mid-110s in the first quarter as customers increased their usage and adopted more products. Contributions from a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, remain a key growth driver of DDOG besides an expanding portfolio.\n\nDatadog has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 22% and 16.7%, respectively, for the current year.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks That Could Make You Obscenely Rich by 2030",
        "content": "The stock market provides ample ways to grow wealth. Dividends and value investing are common methods. But growth stocks can accelerate your journey to financial riches.\n\nOver the long term, earnings growth is the primary driver of stock market returns. And, the same principle applies to individual stocks. As growth companies compound revenues, they grow EPS at a higher rate as they achieve scale and show higher operating leverage. As a result, the stock price follows EPS higher.\n\nBut, where do you find these growth stocks with excellent earnings growth potential? The best areas for growth are new industries or technologies where companies have a long growth runway. The secular growth in cybersecurity, cosmetics and the cloud backs their bullish thesis. Today, they offer substantial gains as they grow in their respective industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best ways to capitalize on the cybersecurity theme and get rich is by buying Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company remains one of the best growth stocks in the technology sector.\n\nCyberthreats are becoming more intense, as the recent Change Healthcare cyber attack proved. With hackers leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and some state actors involved for geopolitical reasons, the threat environment will remain elevated. Thus, the heightened threat plus regulatory requirements like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rules make cyber investments a priority for companies.\n\nAlso, Palo Alto Networks is well-positioned to profit from these trends. The fact that Change Healthcare contracted the company to clean up its attack highlights its competitive advantage. Moreover, its growth in recent years reinforces this view. Revenues have grown at a 23% compounded annual growth rate over the past five years.\n\nStill, despite its scale, it is reporting impressive growth. In the recent third quarter of fiscal year 2024, revenues grew 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $2 billion. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% YOY to $11.3 billion. Furthermore, profitability was impressive, with non-GAAP net income of $454.9 million, increasing 26.5% YOY.\n\nWith a robust platform offering product leadership in 23 cyber categories, Palo Alto Networks is the most comprehensive defense platform. At 12 times forward EV/Sales, PANW stock is set for impressive annual returns.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter another blowout quarter on May 22, e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) remains one of the top growth stocks to buy. Indeed, investors were impressed by the quarter, and as a result, the stock soared 18%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a fundamental standpoint, Q4 of fiscal year 2024 highlighted continued solid execution on all measures. And, looking at full-year financial results, revenues were up an impressive 77%. So, this was the company\u2019s best fiscal year performance in terms of revenue growth.\n\nThe reports get better! e.l.f. Beauty increased its market share for the fifth consecutive year. Moreover, Q4 of fiscal year 2024 was the 21st consecutive quarter of both market share and revenue growth. On that note, market share increased by 325 basis points.\n\nRegarding 2025, the beauty brand issued a rosy outlook predicting $1.23 to 1.25 billion in revenues, representing 20-22% growth. e.l.f. Beauty is well positioned to achieve these targets due to its value. While legacy competitive brands cost $9.50 and $20 per product, respectively, ELF\u2019s average price point is $6.50.\n\nLastly, the cosmetics maker continues to lead with innovation. It holds the number one or two position in 18 cosmetic segments, comprising about 80% of its cosmetic sales. Thus, with such a powerful franchise offering value, ELF stock will soar.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake (SNOW) IPO on the NYSE\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis data warehouse and data lake company is betting on its data cloud and artificial intelligence integrations to deliver the next growth phase. After 34% YOY growth in the recent quarter, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) remains on its growth trajectory.\n\nAI bridges structured and unstructured data and will allow customers to extract valuable information from their mountains of data. That\u2019s why Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sridhar Ramaswamy believes that it will turbocharge Snowflake\u2019s capabilities. On the earnings call, he noted that AI would improve Snowflake\u2019s product across the data, collaboration and application layers.\n\nAnd, the company has been investing in AI products like Cortex, which is already available to customers. Cortex AI is ramping up, with 750 enterprise customers using the product. Other AI products like Iceberg, Snowpark Container Services and Hybrid Tables will be available later this year. Also, the company announced it had developed its own large language model, Artic, which outperformed leading models like Mixtral 8x7B and LLaMA-2-70B in benchmark tests.\n\nTherefore, Snowflake is a top enterprise AI data platform. Upcoming AI products will drive revenue acceleration, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. SNOW stock is a buy, considering its 34% product revenue growth and 128% net revenue retention.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in ELF did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The cybersecurity investment theme still stands out now that many potential attackers are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to compromise systems. Undoubtedly, the leading cybersecurity companies are also making good use of AI. With such a powerful technology that can be used to beef up offense or defense, investors should continue to stick with the market\u2019s top defenders as they look to protect and defend with the full power of AI on their side.\n\nI like to check in with the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) to gauge how the cybersecurity market has been doing. IHAK stock has recently been steadily climbing after experiencing a short-lived correction of around 13% earlier this year. Still down around 8% from its peak, I see potential value in the space. Let\u2019s check in with three of my favorite cybersecurity stocks to buy to play the AI-driven theme.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an $84 billion cybersecurity company leading the charge. At writing, CRWD stock is shy of its all-time highs, just shy of $350 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith a remarkably strong first quarter that saw subscription revenues surge 42% to $651.2 million, up from $459.8 billion in the same quarter last year, Crowdstrike certainly seems like the high-momentum cybersecurity stock to own with all the momentum behind it and impressive generative AI features that could further enhance its impressive offerings.\n\nCharlotte AI is the company\u2019s security analyst who may offer a glimpse into the future of cybersecurity in the generative AI age. With its recently announced collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Service to help with its generative AI endeavors, Crowdstrike stands out as an AI-first company that could quickly outgrow the peer group in the coming years.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a more intriguing value option in the booming cybersecurity space for investors who don\u2019t like chasing hot stocks near their highs. The company is in a bit of a slump, now down around 22% from its all-time high in the middle of 2023.\n\nThe firm clocked in $1.41 billion in total bookings last year, a slight drop of 6% year over year. Indeed, challenging comparables bear part of the blame. Looking ahead, Fortinet stands to tap into AI to help it keep up with rivals and the growing number of AI-equipped attackers.\n\nThe company has its own IoT generative AI assistant named FortiAI, which includes many capabilities that could help neutralize threats. Perhaps the market is discounting FortiAI\u2019s full potential after a rough quarter that I do not view as the start of a negative trend. At 34.4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), I actually see FTNT stock as one of the better bargains in cybersecurity today.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) also looks like an intriguing value option after its brutal 30% implosion in February 2024. Undoubtedly, FTNT stock has come back quite a bit in recent months, but it\u2019s still off around 18% from its peak.\n\nJust a few days ago, Fortinet reported a mild earnings beat for its fiscal third quarter. Adjusted profits came in at $1.32, narrowly ahead of the $1.25 estimate. As for the forecast, Palo Alto sees revenue coming in line with expectations in the ballpark of $2.15-2.17 billion.\n\nLike other cybersecurity innovations, Palo Alto is serious about improving its products with AI to help fight \u201cadvanced\u201d cyber threats. Its Precision AI solution aims to \u201cfight AI with AI.\u201d Indeed, clients armed with Precision AI playing chess as potential attackers look to play checkers!\n\nAt 49.5 times forward P/E, PANW stock still seems a bit pricy. Perhaps waiting for a more substantial pullback would be best as the firm looks to stay ahead of AI-augmented hackers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this security software maker have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Palo Alto belongs, has lost 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share, indicating a change of -2.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.50 points to a change of +23.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Palo Alto.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PANW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $2.16 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $8 billion and $9.1 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +13.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.3%. EPS of $1.32 for the same period compares with $1.10 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +5.6%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The stock market might be at an all-time high, but that doesn\u2019t mean every security is trending higher. On the contrary, there are a number of stocks sinking. Whether due to poor earnings, declining finances or other bad news, some share prices are on the downswing as investors head for the exits. While it might be advisable to eventually bottom fish these names, investors should exercise caution in the near-term.\n\nA lot of stocks that are sliding lower right now are doing so because the companies behind them have serious problems. These problems are not likely to be fixed quickly, and the share price could continue on a long downward trend. Spotting these underperforming names and avoiding them is important and can help keep a portfolio out of trouble. Here are three stocks facing imminent decline in May.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has delivered another disappointing earnings print, sending its stock down 4%. Specifically, the cybersecurity firm reported quarterly billings that missed Wall Street forecasts, further hurting the share price. PANW stock is now down 18% since its previous financial results were delivered in February of this year. Having multiple misses on billings shows that businesses are spending less on cybersecurity as they struggle with inflation and an uncertain economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks managed to beat analysts\u2019 expectations for profits and sales in its most recent quarter. The company reported EPS of $1.32, which topped estimates of $1.25. Revenue for what was the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter came in at $1.98 billion, which was slightly above analyst expectations of $1.97 billion. Sales were up 15% from a year ago. Looking ahead, Palo Alto Networks said that it expects billings in the current quarter of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is inline with Wall Street estimates.\n\nWhile PANW stock is still up 64% over the last 12 months, it\u2019s definitely a stock facing decline in May.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) An image of a grey store front with a white \"Peloton\" logo on the building and a smaller black sign with a white \"Peloton\" logo on it in front of a glass door and window.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the day of this writing, the stock of Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) is down 17% after the maker of internet-connected treadmills and exercise bikes said that it is undertaking a refinancing as it struggles with a cash crunch. The company said that it plans to offer $275 million in convertible senior notes due in 2029 in a private offering and enter a $1 billion five-year term loan and $100 million revolving credit facility.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeloton plans to use the proceeds from the refinancing to buy back $800 million of its 0% convertible senior notes, which are currently due in 2026, and refinance an existing term loan. The refinancing announcement comes weeks after Peloton said that CEO Barry McCarthy is stepping down and that it planned to lay off 15% of its global workforce. The refinancing is designed to improve Peloton\u2019s cash position as demand for its home-based fitness products continues to dwindle.\n\nOver the last 12 months, PTON stock has fallen 55%. Through five years, the share price is down 87%.\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store sign on the outside of one of its locations\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) have declined 20% since May 16, when the restaurant chain announced that it is cutting its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 80%. The move reduces the dividend to 25 cents a share from $1.30. Previously, Cracker Barrel had paid one of the highest yielding dividends around at 9.08%. The company, which operates combined restaurants and gift shops, said the dividend payout is being cut so that it can reallocate capital towards improving its brand.\n\nNews of the dividend reduction has clearly not sat well with investors. However, Cracker Barrel\u2019s management team said the dividend cut is necessary as the company struggles with inflation, low consumer confidence and high interest rates. Cracker Barrel also warned that its upcoming fiscal third- and fourth-quarter results are likely to be below expectations due to weaker-than-anticipated customer traffic. No updated numbers were provided for the coming quarters.\n\nCBRL stock is down more than 53% over the last 12 months. The share price continues to decline in May.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) share price has soared 357% over five years. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. It's also good to see the share price up 10% over the last quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.\n\nSo let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nDuring the last half decade, Palo Alto Networks became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Palo Alto Networks has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Palo Alto Networks' financial health with this freereport on its balance sheet.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Palo Alto Networks shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 50% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 36%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with Palo Alto Networks (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this freelist of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Machine learning stocks are gaining traction as the interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning soars, especially after the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI. This technology has given us a glimpse of its potential, sparking curiosity about its future applications, and has led to my list of machine learning stocks to buy.\n\nMachine learning stocks present a promising opportunity for growth, with the potential to create significant wealth. As per analyst forecasts, I think around a decade from now is when we will see these companies go parabolic and reach their full growth potential.\n\nThese companies leverage machine learning for various applications, including diagnosing life-threatening diseases, preventing credit card fraud, developing chatbots and exploring advanced tech like artificial general intelligence. The future will only get better from here.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for machine learning stocks to buy with substantial upside potential, keep reading to discover three top picks.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings (DKNG) logo on a phone\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) leverages machine learning to enhance its online sports betting and gambling platform. The company has shown significant growth, with recent revenue increases and expansion in legalized betting markets.\n\nDKNG has significantly revised its revenue outlook for 2024 upwards, expecting it to be between $4.65 billion and $4.9 billion, marking an anticipated year-over-year growth of 27% to 34%. This adjustment reflects higher projections compared to their earlier forecast ranging from $4.50 billion to $4.80 billion. Additionally, the company has increased its adjusted EBITDA forecast for 2024, now ranging from $410 million to $510 million, up from the previous estimate of $350 million to $450 million.\n\nDraftKings has also announced plans to acquire the gambling company Jackpocket for $750 million in a cash-and-stock deal. This acquisition is expected to further enhance DraftKings\u2019 market presence and capabilities in online betting.\n\nI covered DKNG before, and I still think it\u2019s one of the best meme stocks that investors can get behind. The company\u2019s stock price has risen 72.64% over the past year, and it seems there\u2019s still plenty of fuel left in the tank to surge higher.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Exterior view of Cloudflare headquarters. NET stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) provides a cloud platform that offers a range of network services to businesses worldwide. The company uses machine learning to enhance its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloudflare has outlined a robust strategy for 2024, focusing on advancing its cybersecurity solutions and expanding its network services. The company expects to generate total revenue between $1.648 billion and $1.652 billion for the year. This revenue forecast reflects a significant increase in their operational scale.\n\nNET is another stock that is leveraging machine learning to its full advantage. I\u2019ve been bullish on this company for some time and continue to be so. Notably, Cloudflare is expanding its deployment of inference-tuned graphic processing units (GPUs) across its global network. By the end of 2024, these GPUs will be deployed in nearly every city within Cloudflare\u2019s network.\r\n\r\nNET has been silently integrating many parts of its network within the internet\u2019s fabric for millions of users, such as through its DNS service, Cloudflare WARP; reverse proxy for website owners; and much more. Around 30% of the 10,000 most popular websites globally use Cloudflare. Many of NET\u2019s services can be accessed free of charge.\n\nIt is following a classic tech stock strategy of expanding its users, influence and reach over reaching immediate profits, and its financials have slowly scaled with this performance.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading cybersecurity company that uses machine learning to detect and prevent cyber threats.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report on Mar. 5, CRWD reported a 102% earnings growth to 95 cents per share and a 33% revenue increase to $845.3 million. Analysts expect a 57% earnings growth to 89 cents per share in the next report and a 27% EPS increase for the full fiscal year ending in January.\n\nAdding to the bull case for CRWD is that it has has partnered with Google Cloud by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) to enhance AI-native cybersecurity solutions, positioning itself strongly against competitors like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nMany contributors here at Investorplace have identified CRWD as one of the best cybersecurity stocks for investors to buy, and I am in agreement here. Its aggressive EPS growth and stock price appreciation (140.04% over the past year), make it a very attractive pick for long-term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It\u2019s not just Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk: Other companies are also pushing pay packages higher.\n\nTesla stockholders will have a chance on June 13 to bless a $56 billion compensation deal Musk received in 2018 that was nullified by a Delaware judge earlier this year.\n\nWhile Musk\u2019s pay would be the biggest in US corporate history, he is not the only head of a company testing new compensation limits.\n\nMedian total CEO compensation rose 11.4% in fiscal 2023 to $23.7 million, according to an Equilar analysis of firms with with revenues greater than $1 billion. That followed a 7.7% boost in 2022.\n\nThe number of CEOs in the S&P 500 who nabbed total pay packages worth more than $50 million has also jumped in recent years, according to a recent analysis from the Wall Street Journal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Leon Neal/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo (via REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe highest paid in 2023 was Broadcom boss (AVGO) Hock Tan, who made $162 million and exercised $767.7 million in stock options that vested when Broadcom's share price reached preset goals.\n\nThe next highest was Palo Alto Network (PANW) CEO Nikesh Arora, who took in $151 million in pay and exercised $266.4 million in performance-based stock options.\n\nPay for the top boss is rising at smaller companies, too.\n\nMedian CEO compensation levels at Russell 3000 companies with revenue less than $50 million increased 19.3% between 2018 and 2022, according to a separate analysis conducted by data provider Gallagher.\n\nThat was a bigger leap than CEO pay at larger firms during that period. Those with annual revenue exceeding $20 billion had awards increase by 2.4%.\n\nNot all CEOs have found shareholders receptive to these increases. Last week, 3M shareholders voted against $16.4 million in compensation for its former CEO Mike Roman, as well as other company executives.\n\nA 'wild outlier'\n\nWhether the outsized award to Musk in 2018 helped influence all of these increases is debatable.\n\nGreg Varallo, a lawyer for the Tesla shareholders who successfully sued the company to undo Musk's pay package, called Musk's deal a \"wild outlier\" that \"drags the average up materially.\"\n\n\"What we saw immediately after the Musk deal became final, was a very rapid acceleration in the amount of pay packages,\" Varallo said. \"It single handedly skewed the compensation data.\"\n\nJames Reda, managing director for Gallagher\u2019s executive compensation consulting practice said \"it skewed the average data a little bit,\" but \"it wasn't like football, where someone got $25 million and someone making $15 million said 'I want that money.'\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCompanies were less influenced by Musk's pay deal, Reda said, because its structure was so unusual.\n\n\"Companies looked at that and said, 'I don't think we could do that,'\" Reda said. \"It had an effect on Tesla and its shareholders, but not on the market for pay, that I can tell.\" Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison in 2001 exercised $706 million in company stock options \u2014 today worth $1.2 billion. REUTERS/Noah Berger (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nOne corporate governance expert, Gunster lawyer Bob Lamm, said CEOs who preceded Musk by decades helped usher in today\u2019s CEO compensation levels.\n\nOne notable example was in 2006, when Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) then CEO Ray Irani earned more than $400 million, including $2.9 million in salary and bonus, $270.2 million in exercised stock options, and $93.3 million in deferred stock.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the sum would now be worth roughly $622 million.\n\nAnother came even earlier in 2001, when Oracle co-founder and CEO Larry Ellison exercised $706 million in company stock options \u2014 today worth $1.2 billion.\n\nBut Lamm points out that founders and creators like Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs tend to catch less scrutiny for compensation packages that break the mold.\n\n\"I certainly think Elon Musk would be in that same category,\" Lamm said.\n\nThe Musk vote\n\nThere's no guarantee that Tesla shareholders will agree to Musk's pay, either.\n\nBloomberg reported that a small group of stockholders has called for investors to vote 'no.' And more legal red tape could frustrate the package if re-approved.\n\nMusk's 2018 deal was designed to pay Musk zero compensation for his work at Tesla unless the electric vehicle maker reached certain market capitalization and operational milestones, and remained in a leadership role at the company.\n\nMilestones achieved entitled Musk to 1% of Tesla\u2019s 2018 value.\n\nThe deal was invalidated in January by Delaware\u2019s head Chancery Court judge Chancellor Kathleen McCormick.\n\nMcCormick sided with Tesla shareholders who alleged in a derivative lawsuit that the all-equity, performance-based plan was illegally recommended by Tesla\u2019s board because the board members who approved it were essentially controlled by Musk.\n\nThe Tesla team put this together of their own volition (I did not ask for it). Thanks! https://t.co/8VRNhwmMxm\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 20, 2024\n\nAt the time of the shareholders\u2019 suit, Musk had neither exercised nor taken any distributions from the agreement. Tesla asked shareholders to re-vote on Musk\u2019s pay package in a preliminary proxy filing published in mid-April.\n\nIt argued it had cured the conditions that led Delaware Chancellor McCormick to void the deal. According to the board, a single-member special committee headed by independent director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson evaluated and recommended the deal with the help of third party consultants.\n\nLegal experts said those arguments might not be enough to keep shareholders from suing Tesla and the board all over again, arguing that the sole director who approved it was not independent enough from Musk.\n\nShareholders could also argue that the company's disclosures around the deal still fell short.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The surge in Big Tech share prices prompted four splits among the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 mega-cap stocks since 2022, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) making shares more accessible.

On average, returns one year post-split are 25%, compared to around 12% for the broader market.\n\n\u201cSplits seem to be bullish across market regimes, something management teams might consider if shares look too expensive for buybacks,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nWhen comparing the distribution of stock split returns relative to the S&P 500, it can be seen that a few strong companies often improve average performance. For instance, Copart (NASDAQ:CPRT) gained 56% in the 12 months following its October 2022 split announcement, while Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) rose 39% after declaring its split in August 2022, BofA highlighted.\n\nGiven that gains are more common and typically larger than losses, stock splits appear to introduce upside potential into markets. For example, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Valero experienced strong performance after their split announcements, regardless of their prior trading behavior.\n\nHowever, outperformance is not guaranteed, BofA\u2019s team cautions. Roughly 30% of stocks see negative returns 12 months post-split, with an average decline of 22%. While splits may indicate strong momentum, companies can still struggle in a challenging macro environment.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Tesla, and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) struggled in the 12 months after splits were announced in 2022 as interest rates spiked. Amazon is a good example of how stocks can recover, however, and was up 26% in the 24 months after its split announcement,\u201d the firm noted.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrent NVDA shareholders will receive 10 shares for every share they own today, while the market capitalization of the AI giant will remain unchanged.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia: This is how stock splits are performing 12 months after announcement\n\nExclusive-KKR set for unconditional EU antitrust okay for Telecom Italia deal, sources say\n\nWorkday shares dive 12% on lowered subscription revenue outlook\n\nView comments",

        "title": "$1,000 Goes a Long Way: 3 Stocks That Could Deliver Hefty Returns",
        "content": "Although it no longer takes money to make money on Wall Street, the more you have, the faster you can get to where you\u2019re going.\n\nYou can buy stocks with as little as $20 these days and not worry about getting skinned from transaction fees. But if you save up a little more cash you can buy more high-potential stocks, accelerating your ability to generate hefty returns from your investments.\n\nWith $1,000 to buy into a company, you can jump-start the journey of setting yourself up for a comfortable retirement. Below are three high-potential stocks to buy today, particularly if you have a cool grand available that you don\u2019t need for bills or emergencies. These are stellar companies with a fantastic track record and a long road of growth to look forward to.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDomino\u2019s (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nPizza shop Domino\u2019s (NYSE:DPZ) is the first company to buy with $1,000 to your name. Although it used to be known primarily for getting your cardboard-tasting pie delivered to you fast, a commitment to quality and getting it right rather than quick made it the premier pizza stock. What is still not realized by many is just how tasty Domino\u2019s dividend is. It might just be better than its stuffed cheesy bread.\n\nDomino\u2019s has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. It has also increased the payout at a mind-bending 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over that time frame. That\u2019s nearly unheard of from dividend stalwarts let alone a pizza chain. Yet having found the secret of growth, Domino\u2019s shares its wealth with investors.\n\nBy now the pizzeria is well-known for its \u201cfortressing\u201d strategy of flooding a market with stores to create a critical mass of mindshare amongst consumers. Each store might not make as much, but Domino\u2019s sales overall increase. Revenue jumped 7.3% in the first quarter compared to a 5.9% increase a year ago. The stock has responded as well.\n\nDPZ shares are up 25% this year and are 65% higher over the last 12 months. For the past decade Domino\u2019s delivered a total return of 705%, nearly three times greater than the 241% return of the S&P 500. The power of capital appreciation and a rising dividend make Domino\u2019s an excellent high-potential stock to buy for the next decade of growth.\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome improvement expert Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW) is another dividend powerhouse. It has increased its payout for over 50 years, making it a dividend king. Yet equally impressive is that in just the past five years it has doubled the dividend for investors. The payment went from from $2.06 per share in 2018 to $4.40 last year, a better than 16% CAGR.\n\nStory continues\n\nLowe\u2019s just reported first-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line, even though results were down year-over-year. The Federal Reserve\u2019s high-interest rate policies, coupled with elevated government-induced inflation rates, are pressuring retailers everywhere. Consumers are cutting back on big purchases as they must spend more on necessities.\n\nSales fell 4% in the quarter to $21.4 billion on a similar decline in comparable sales. Its professional business, however, saw positive comps for the period as it pushed harder to bring in more contractors. Compared to Home Depot (NYSE:HD), though, Lowe\u2019s has a higher concentration of do-it-yourself customers.\n\nStill, the DIY center reiterated it sees full-year sales guidance of $84 billion to $85 billion, in line with analyst estimates of $84.4 billion. Profits are forecast at $12.15 per share at the midpoint of its range, below Wall Street\u2019s $12.19 per share.\n\nLowe\u2019s has weathered such storms before and with the stock trading at 16 times earnings estimates and 20x free cash flow, it\u2019s a high-potential stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) also just reported earnings that are showing the ill effects of government and Fed policies. Although fiscal fourth-quarter results were mostly inline with expectations, bookings showed customers were stretching out their payments to cope with rising costs instead of paying upfront.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is consolidating its business under a single security platform intended to drive growth amongst enterprise-class customers. However, its results didn\u2019t suggest there was much meaningful movement in that direction as macroeconomic concerns impact their performance as well. The cybersecurity stock, though, deemed the response \u201centhusiastic\u201d and sees significant growth coming down the road.\n\nNew products designed for its AI-powered Cortex platform has potential to deliver greater performance. It also just signed a partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to deliver new AI enhanced security offerings. IBM will prefer Palo Alto as its cybersecurity partner across its network, cloud and security operations center (SOC).\n\nBecause these macro concerns will be relatively transitory, its results merely indicate a lag, not an abandonment of profitable growth and Palo Alto Networks is still a high-potential stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LOW stock.

        "content": "We\u2019re still sitting ducks when it comes to cyberattacks, which creates an opportunity for some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nThe\u00a0U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) just warned that attacks against water utilities are becoming more frequent and severe. They\u2019re also urging water systems to take immediate action to protect the nation\u2019s drinking water.\n\nIn Michigan,\u00a0pharmacies struggled to fill prescriptions because of a ransomware attacks on Ascension Rx retail pharmacies. Other attacks this year included a denial of service (DDoS) attacks on French state services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChange Healthcare is still reeling from an attack that\u2019s been called the \u201cbiggest ever cybersecurity attacks on the American healthcare system,\u201d\u00a0as noted by CBS News.\n\nIn 2022, the\u00a0global\u00a0cost of cybercrimes came in at $8.44 trillion,\u00a0according to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the International Monetary Fund. By 2027, it could balloon to $23.84 trillion. Unfortunately, until governments, businesses, schools and your average person take these threats far more seriously, they\u2019ll continue to get worse.\n\nUntil the cybersecurity threat diminishes \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen any time soon \u2013 you may want to invest in some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy, such as:\n\nRadware (RDWR) internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecurity\n\nSource: Song_about_summer / Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned\u00a0Radware (NASDAQ:RDWR), it traded at $16.85 on April 29.\n\nAt the time, I noted it had\u00a0just launched a new artificial intelligence-powered Domain Name Service (DNS) Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack protection solution. Since that mention, the stock exploded to a high of $20.42.\n\nNow overbought at double-top resistance, I\u2019d wait for it to pull back first before buying more.\n\nHelping, the company just posted first quarter earnings per share of 16 cents, which beat by three cents. Revenue of $65.1 million \u2013 down 5.7% year over year \u2013 also beat by $1.53 million.\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we saw a recovery in customer spending, driven by a slight improvement in the business environment and a surge in cyber-attacks. Looking ahead to 2024, we intend to capitalize on the strong growth across our cloud security business and partner channels and the market need for best-in-class critical security. We believe we are well-positioned to return to revenue growth and improved profitability,\u201d\u00a0said Roy Zisapel, Radware\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nOversold shares of\u00a0Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) are pushing aggressively higher, too.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $260 in February, it\u2019s now up to $323.77. From here, I\u2019d like to see it initially refill its bearish gap at around $370. Earnings haven\u2019t been too shabby either. In its third quarter, EPS of $1.23 beat by seven cents. Revenue of $1.98 billion \u2013 up 15.1% year over year \u2013 beat by $10 million.\n\nMoving forward, the company expects fourth-quarter billings to range from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, which is a year-over-year growth range of 9% to 10%. It also expects to see total revenue of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, as compared to estimates of $2.16 billion.\n\nJPMorgan just raised its price target on PANW to $340, with an overweight rating. KeyBanc also raised its price target to $384 with an overweight rating.\n\nEven better, Palo Alto and\u00a0IBM (NYSE:IBM) just partnered to develop and sell artificial intelligence-powered security solutions for the digital world.\n\nCyberArk (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter bottoming out at around $225,\u00a0CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is starting to pivot higher. It\u2019s also another one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy today.\n\nLast trading at $249.70, if it can break above its 50-day moving average, it could rally to $265 next. Helping, it just acquired\u00a0Venafi\u00a0from\u00a0Thoma Bravo\u00a0for $1.54 billion in cash.\n\n\u201cThis acquisition marks a pivotal milestone for CyberArk, enabling us to further our vision to secure every identity \u2013 human and machine \u2013 with the right level of privilege controls,\u201d\u00a0said Matt Cohen, Chief Executive Officer, CyberArk.\n\nCYBR earnings have also been impressive. In its first quarter, the company posted EPS of 75 cents, which beat by 48 cents. Revenue of $221.6 million \u2013 up 37% year over year \u2013 beat by $8.38 million. The subscription portion of its annual recurring revenue (ARR) jumped 54% to $621 million year over year. Even total ARR jumped 69% to $156.2 million.\n\nIt also raised its outlook on total revenue for the second quarter. It now expects total revenue to range from $215 million to $221 million, which is 22% to 26% growth. For the full-year, it expects for total revenue to range from $928 million to $938 million, or 23% to 25% growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Decoding Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Robust revenue growth with a 15.3% year-over-year increase, reflecting heightened demand for cybersecurity solutions. Expansion in product offerings and strategic acquisitions positioning PANW for diversified growth. Competitive pressures and rapid technological changes remain significant threats to PANW's market share. Investments in research and development showcase PANW's commitment to innovation and market leadership.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PANW.\n\nOn May 21, 2024, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) filed its 10-Q report, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial health and strategic positioning. As a leading cybersecurity vendor, PANW has demonstrated a strong financial performance, with total revenue reaching $1,984.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a notable increase from $1,720.9 million in the same period last year. This growth is primarily driven by the company's subscription and support segment, which accounted for 80.3% of the total revenue. The company's net income also saw a significant surge to $278.8 million, up from $107.8 million year-over-year, showcasing its profitability and operational efficiency. With a broad portfolio covering network security, cloud security, and security operations, PANW serves over 85,000 customers worldwide, including a substantial portion of the Global 2000. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest financial data and market trends. Decoding Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nMarket Leadership and Innovation: Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) stands out in the cybersecurity landscape with its comprehensive platform-based approach. The company's significant investment in research and development, amounting to $457.2 million in the recent quarter, underscores its commitment to innovation. PANW's product portfolio, which includes advanced solutions like ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls and Prisma Cloud Code to CloudTM platform, positions it as a leader in network firewalls, SASE, SSE, and SD-WAN. This technological edge is further reinforced by the company's AI and automation capabilities, which are critical in addressing sophisticated cyber threats.\n\nFinancial Robustness: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing reveal a strong balance sheet for PANW. The company's net income has experienced a remarkable year-over-year increase, indicating robust profitability and cash flow generation. With a net cash provided by operating activities of $2,744.9 million, PANW has the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth initiatives, invest in product development, and navigate economic uncertainties. This financial strength is a key differentiator in the competitive cybersecurity market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Subscription and Support Revenue: While PANW's subscription and support segment is a significant revenue driver, accounting for 80.3% of total revenue, this dependence could be a potential weakness. Any disruption in subscription renewals or support services could adversely impact the company's revenue streams. Moreover, the shift in customer preferences towards cloud-based solutions may necessitate continuous investment in service offerings to retain and grow the customer base.\n\nOperational Risks: PANW's operational expenses, particularly sales and marketing, remain high at $718.7 million, reflecting the competitive nature of the cybersecurity industry. The need to maintain a strong sales force and channel partner relationships to drive growth results in substantial costs, which could impact the company's operating margins. Additionally, the complexity of managing a global supply chain for hardware products introduces risks related to manufacturing and logistics, which could affect the company's ability to deliver products timely and cost-effectively.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpanding Cybersecurity Demand: The increasing prevalence of cyber threats and the shift towards remote work and cloud computing have led to a surge in demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its comprehensive product offerings and established market presence. The company's focus on securing remote workforces and cloud-delivered branches presents significant growth opportunities as businesses continue to prioritize cybersecurity in their digital transformation strategies.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions: PANW's proactive approach to acquisitions, as evidenced by its recent business acquisitions, enables the company to expand its product capabilities and enter new markets. By integrating acquired technologies and expertise, PANW can offer more comprehensive solutions to its customers, driving revenue growth and enhancing its competitive advantage.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: The cybersecurity industry is characterized by intense competition from established players and new entrants. PANW faces challenges from companies with greater financial and technical resources, which could lead to price pressures and market share erosion. The rapid pace of technological change also requires continuous innovation to maintain a competitive edge, and any failure to do so could result in lost customers and declining revenues.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: As a global provider of cybersecurity solutions, PANW must navigate complex regulatory environments and comply with various international laws and standards. Changes in regulations or non-compliance could result in fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage, potentially affecting the company's financial performance and market position.\n\nIn conclusion, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) exhibits a strong financial foundation and market leadership in the cybersecurity space, driven by its innovative product offerings and strategic growth initiatives. However, the company must address its operational risks and reliance on subscription-based revenue while navigating a highly competitive landscape and regulatory complexities. By leveraging its strengths and opportunities, PANW can continue to thrive in the evolving cybersecurity market, but it must remain vigilant against the threats that could impact its success.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Seeking Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks? Check Out Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT)",
        "content": "At first glance, cybersecurity specialist Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) presents a tale of two cities. On the positive front, the company benefits from the growing cybersecurity market. As a protective agent against nefarious online threats, it can save enterprises heaps of trouble. On the other hand, Fortinet is underperforming its rivals. Still, the lackluster market action also makes FTNT\u2019s valuation relatively attractive. Therefore, I am bullish on FTNT stock.\n\nFTNT Stock Is a Case of Good but Not Great\n\nWhen assessing FTNT stock (especially recently), it\u2019s difficult not to come away with an underlying takeaway: Fortinet is a case of being good but not necessarily great. And that poses competitive risks as the company\u2019s rivals seemingly present a better look.\n\nFor example, TipRanks reporter Sirisha Bhogaraju noted that for the first quarter of 2024, Fortinet published better-than-expected sales and earnings. Perhaps most notably, revenue increased by 7% on a year-over-year basis to $1.35 billion. Further, adjusted earnings per share expanded by 26.5% during the same timeframe to 43 cents.\n\nStill, FTNT stock didn\u2019t receive a benefit from the earnings print; it actually got punished. Bhogaraju wrote that \u201cinvestors were disappointed with the 6.4% decline in Q1 2024 billings, a key indicator of future growth, to $1.41 billion.\u201d\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, the reporter mentioned that the \u201cmid-point of the company\u2019s guidance range for Q2 billings indicates a decline of 1%. The company expects headwinds impacting its business to ease in the second half of the year.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, Fortinet identified soft spending by enterprises as a major challenge. In addition, \u201ccompetition from companies offering a consolidated cybersecurity platform\u201d is impacting Fortinet. That\u2019s not the greatest situation for FTNT stock. Subsequently, FTNT stock is up a bit over 6% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nThe price action compares poorly to that of rival Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). On a YTD basis, PANW gained 10%, but it\u2019s not just about outright performance. In the trailing month, PANW gained over 14%, whereas FTNT fell 3%. In other words, near-term momentum is rising for Palo Alto while fading for Fortinet.\n\nEven Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), which is off to a rough start in 2024, has gained almost 6% in the past month. That doesn\u2019t seem very encouraging for FTNT stock until you factor in its valuation.\n\nA Better Deal Presents a Compelling Case for Fortinet\n\nAt the moment, FTNT trades at 8.91x trailing-year revenue. Objectively, that\u2019s rather high for the underlying software infrastructure space, which runs an average price-to-sales multiple of 4.24x. Still, compared to the competition, Fortinet seems very attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotably, while Palo Alto commands the cybersecurity spotlight, it does so at a price. PANW trades at 14.85x trailing-year revenue. Further, Zscaler trades at 13.88x sales, even though ZS is down nearly 16% YTD.\n\nOf course, valuation isn\u2019t everything \u2013 there are numerous other factors to consider when investing. However, the argument for FTNT stock is that while the underlying enterprise may not arguably offer the best narrative among the three cybersecurity firms, it presents the best deal to revenue \u2013 and by a wide margin.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true that reduced enterprise spending is a problem for Fortinet. However, that\u2019s also an issue for the rest of the cybersecurity ecosystem. At the same time, cybersecurity is a non-negotiable because of the severe damage that can result if enterprises operate without adequate protection.\n\nAccording to one report, the global average cost of a data breach in 2023 stood at $4.45 million. However, as recent cyberattacks have demonstrated, one breach could impact millions of customers. That, in turn, can create a whole host of problems, not the least of which is ongoing reputational damage.\n\nTherefore, in the cybersecurity realm, the old adage really does apply: an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.\n\nFortinet could easily latch onto this narrative and benefit along a rising tide. What\u2019s more, because of its much lower sales multiple, FTNT stock arguably represents lower fundamental risk.\n\nExploring the Projected Demand Context\n\nIn fairness to the competition, while FTNT stock may feature a lower revenue multiple, one other factor must be considered: analysts expect a lower demand profile.\n\nFor Fiscal 2024, Wall Street is looking for Fortinet to ring up $5.8 billion in sales. That\u2019s up 9.3% from last year\u2019s tally of $5.3 billion. In contrast, Palo Alto may hit revenue of $7.98 billion or up 15.8% against the prior year.\n\nAt that rate, PANW would be trading at around 12.9x sales. As for Zscaler, analysts anticipate Fiscal 2024 revenue of $2.12 billion or up 31.1%. Here, ZS would be trading at 12.64x sales. While these stats represent an improvement over their respective current multiples, the reality as things stand now, they\u2019re still considerably higher than FTNT\u2019s trailing-year multiple of 8.91x.\n\nTheoretically, then, FTNT stock should enjoy a valuation \u201csafety buffer\u201d against its two rivals.\n\nIs Fortinet Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FTNT stock has a Hold consensus rating based on nine Buys, 18 Holds, and two Sell ratings. The average FTNT stock price target is $70.46, implying 15% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: FTNT Stock Brings Good Value in a Relevant Sector\n\nAs a whole, Fortinet is a decent player in the burgeoning and pertinent cybersecurity industry. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t have the oomph of other rivals. Still, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing because FTNT stock happens to be trading at a relative discount to its peers. As a result, investors shouldn\u2019t overlook Fortinet.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Palo Alto Networks Inc. fell in Tuesday trading after giving a downbeat forecast for the current period, renewing concerns about a slowdown in cybersecurity services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne Dead After Singapore Air Flight Hit By Severe Turbulence ASML, TSMC Can Disable Chip Machines If China Invades Taiwan \u2018It Felt Like We Had Crashed,\u2019 a Singapore Air Passenger Recalls Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy Tesla Shareholder Group Slams Elon Musk\u2019s $56 Billion Pay Package\n\nRevenue in the fiscal fourth quarter will be $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, the company said in a statement Monday. Analysts had anticipated a number at the high end of that range, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFourth-quarter billings \u2014 a closely watched benchmark \u2014 will be $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion in the period, which runs through July, Palo Alto Networks said. Analysts had estimated $3.47 billion.\n\nThe tepid outlook follows another disappointing quarterly report in February, when Palo Alto Networks shares suffered their worst single-day drop ever. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Nikesh Arora said customers were facing \u201cspending fatigue\u201d in cybersecurity. That stoked fears that clients were tightening their budgets in spite of an uptick in attacks.\n\nArora said the cybersecurity company faced \u201cshort-term bumps\u201d as the market absorbs shifts in its strategic ambition in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. The cybersecurity sector remains \u201cvery robust,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Company\u2019s shares were down around 6% at 9:39 a.m. in New York, their biggest swing in three months.\n\nShorter contracts and strategy changes have been weighing on bookings at Palo Alto Networks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. But management expects growth to pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nDuring a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Dipak Golechha acknowledged that the company had \u201csignificant volatility in our billings.\u201d But he argued that it was due to payment terms and that there were other more relevant metrics, such as new subscription sales for next-generation products, which can include artificial intelligence.\n\nArora echoed that idea, saying that billings were \u201can artificial metric.\u201d He prefers looking at subscription revenue and remaining performance obligations, and said he was surprised by the reaction of the market. \u201cUsing those numbers, the business is stronger than we expected it to be,\u201d Arora said.\n\n\u2018No Change\u2019\n\nArora also said that cyberattacks continue unabated. He pointed to breaches by sophisticated nation-state actors and others that he said can wreak damage on systems within a matter of hours. Arora said he expects cybersecurity spending to continue, adding that customers are focused on securing the cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOn spending for cybersecurity, we see no change in the space or trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cMost customers have a series of projects they want to get done and the only limiting factor seems to be the execution capability.\u201d\n\nAn April report backed by the US government highlighted the risks of cloud computing. It cited multiple problems with Microsoft Corp. specifically, but also raised concerns more widely about the ability of nation-state actors to compromise cloud service systems with increasing sophistication.\n\nEven so, Palo Alto Networks and its peers have been suffering from a slowdown in firewall sales, according to Westpark Capital, while other product categories are facing \u201cintense competition.\u201d\n\nSlower Sales\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 15% to $1.98 billion, marking the slowest growth since the start of 2020. Earnings came in at $1.32 a share, excluding some items. Still, both figures topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company reported a 3% rise in billings for the quarter, the smallest gain since its initial public offering in 2012.\n\nBut next-generation annualized recurring revenue \u2014 one of the figures touted by Palo Alto Networks executives \u2014 was $3.79 billion, beating the $3.71 billion estimate and up 47%. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted sales that have yet to be billed, stood at $11.3 billion, up 23%.\n\n(Updated to include quotes from Palo Alto Networks CEO in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019 Google\u2019s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth How the $17 Desk Salad Won Millennium Covets Citadel-Size Commodities Gains, Just Not the Risk Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

However, that drove an increase in bookings with payments deferred over the term of the purchase instead of upfront, as clients grappled with higher borrowing costs, a trend Palo Alto expects will continue.\n\nThe company projected fourth-quarter billings to be between $3.43 billion and $3.48 billion, the mid-point of which was largely in line with LSEG estimate of $3.45 billion.\n\n\"Clearly investors had been hopeful for more, as the stock price crept up since early April in anticipation of earnings,\" analysts at Bernstein said in a client note.\n\nPalo Alto's shares had gained about 11% this month through Monday's close.\n\nStill, analysts remained optimistic as new AI products and a deal with IBM to deliver AI-powered security are expected to accelerate performance at the company.\n\n\"We continue to believe the company remains well-positioned to consolidate security spend and to maintain above-peer growth,\" analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Zaheer Kachwala; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Palo Alto's Conservative Approach Fails To Impress\n\nOn Monday, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) shares plunged upon its fiscal third quarter report that failed to impress due to a conservative guidance. Last week, Palo Alto Networks revealed it is buying cloud security software assets from International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) via a joint press release, also suggesting Palo Alto is in need of a power boost.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 30th, Palo Alto reported that revenue grew 15% YoY\u00a0to $1.98 billion.\u00a0Net income\u00a0amounted to\u00a0$278.8 million, or 79 cents a share, while adjusted earnings amounted to\u00a0$1.32\u00a0per share, surpassing\u00a0FactSet consensus\u00a0of\u00a0$1.25 a share.\n\nFiscal fourth quarter guidance that failed to impress.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto guided for revenue in the range from\u00a0$2.15 billion to $2.17 billion\u00a0with billings ranging from\u00a0$3.43 billion to $3.48 billion,\u00a0accounting for\u00a0deferred revenue.\n\nA Narrowed Down Full Year Guidance\n\nPalo Alto did not lift the outlook it provided in February, just narrowed it down. For the\u00a0full-year, Palo Alto guided for bookings between\u00a0$10.13 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$10.18 billion\u00a0while it previously expected them to come in between\u00a0$10.1 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$10.2 billion. Palo Alto guided for revenue in the range between\u00a0$7.99 billion\u00a0and\u00a0$8.01 billion, narrowing down its prior range between\u00a0$7.95 billion to $8.00 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Enlists Help From IBM\n\nAs part of a broader partnership, IBM will provide the cybersecurity company access to more consultants and a bigger customer base.\u00a0Palo Alto is acquiring\u00a0the\u00a0QRadar cloud software\u00a0from IBM\u00a0for an undisclosed sum, as well as\u00a0migrating existing customers to its security platform, Cortex Xsiam. In addition,\u00a0IBM will train more than 1,000 of its consulting employees on Palo Alto\u2019s products.\u00a0This strategic alliance between IBM and Palo Alto Networks reflects the current consolidation trend in the\u00a0security software industry as companies join forces to get ready for the future attacks that will be empowered by AI.\u00a0Palo Alto is growing much faster than IBM\u00a0so IBM is also getting a needed boost through this alliance.\u00a0IBM CEO\u00a0Arvind Krishna\n\nExpects that IBM is\u00a0going to\u00a0generate\u00a0significant consulting business\u00a0growth\u00a0on Palo Alto\u2019s products,\u00a0much like with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0Azure and\u00a0Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:\u00a0AWS) as IBM\u00a0helps organizations run their software on the\u00a0public clouds from both\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsolidations are in the security software industry\u2019s air.\n\nFor example, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) snapped up the leading provider of\u00a0security information and event management\u00a0(SIEM) software. Cisco wrapped up its biggest ever $28 billion acquisition earlier in March. Although the SIEM category has been around for more than two decades, Palo Alto just introduced Cortex Xsiam two years ago.\u00a0Cortex Xsiam\u2019s adoption has been rapid and\u00a0Nikesh Arora, CEO\u00a0of Palo Alto Networks also added it has been taking market share from \u201ceverone\u201d.\n\nPalo Alto former CEO acknowledges the company does not use the most sophisticated AI.\n\nIn a climate where \u2018best of breed\u2019 solutions are demanded,\u00a0prioritizing quality, former CEO, Lane\u00a0Bess emphasized Palo Alto\u2019s ability to effectively defend against cyberattacks while acknowledging it does not use the most sophisticated AI. This is why the security alliance with IBM to jointly provide AI-powered offerings comes at a good time for the company to deliver on its promise of unleashing the power of AI to take cybersecurity to the next level.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Why Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Shares Are Sliding Today",
        "content": "Why Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Shares Are Sliding Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) fell 9% in the pre-market session after the company reported first-quarter results, with remaining performance obligations (RPO - leading revenue indicator) falling slightly short of Wall Street's expectations. Also, billing growth decelerated (+3%) year on year. Management doesn't consider billings to be a true indicator of the strength of the business due to a mix-shift in customers' payment terms towards annual billing plans. The company added, \"We saw a greater volume of large deals with some of these customers opting for deferred payments over the term of their purchase instead of paying upfront as they grapple with the higher cost of money.\" This weakness is also consistent with the company's platformization strategy (aimed at driving consolidation while providing customers a period of the contract for free as part of their commitment), which is expected to pose a headwind to billings over a 12- to 18-month period. As a quick recap, the company updated during the previous earnings call that \"a typical customer entering into a platformization transaction will not pay us for our technology for a period of time.\" These puts and takes might be tough for investors to track and digest.\n\nOn a more posiitive note, revenue beat by a small amount and operating profit as well as EPS beat by more convincing amounts. Billings and revenue guidance for next quarter was roughly in line. Full year billings and revenue guidance were also roughly in line. After last quarter's poor results and cautious commentary, the market was likely hoping for better results.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Palo Alto Networks? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nPalo Alto Networks's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 12 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock dropped 26.9% on the news that the company reported second-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. EPS guidance for the full year was more in line. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well. The company highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments. The long-term demand forecast was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of \"a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings.\" In addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a \"platformization\" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, management noted that a typical customer adopting the platform \" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months.\" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street turned more negative following the results, with multiple downgrades after earnings. Piper Sandler analyst Rob Owens downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight to Neutral and lowered the price target from $350 to $300, adding, \"[Palo Alto Networks] is the largest platform player in the segment and, in hopes to accelerate that positioning, will take an aggressive approach in offering free product with the promise of longer-term, platform contracts. This should negatively impact the business for 12-18 months - eliminating $600M from billings estimates in the back half of this year.\" Loop Capital analyst Yun Kim also downgraded the stock's rating from Buy to Hold, citing a \"high degree of variability and uncertainty\" following the updates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance dragging shares down.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is up 7.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $310.90 per share it is still trading 17.5% below its 52-week high of $376.90 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Palo Alto Networks's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,091.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As more of the world\u2019s technology moves online, the demand for cybersecurity stocks to buy will continue to increase. Seen in nearly every major part of any tech company\u2019s operational expenditures, it\u2019s no wonder its market is currently valued at over $200 billion and set to continue increasing at a near 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Used by cloud computing services, B2B software companies and AI companies, cybersecurity has become a necessity to provide stability and customer satisfaction.\n\nDespite cybersecurity\u2019s importance, it is a relatively small sector compared to other technologies. Thus, identifying the growing winners in such an emerging industry can easily be a winning strategy for savvy investors. Here are three cybersecurity stocks to buy now for a massive run in 2025. Who knows, maybe these companies will put you into the million-dollar club as well!\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American cybersecurity company that has been a trailblazer for integrating AI into its security services. The stock has already returned 40% this year, and analysts still remain bullish. Wall Street currently has an average price target of $399.03 and a high-end target of $540. At these targets, that would represent a 15% and 60% upside from the stock\u2019s current price!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis company has done an excellent job in uniquely approaching cybersecurity. It has created a single mesh network that allows all users to benefit from any threats, no matter who receives them. This creates an efficient and scalable platform, called Falcon, to identify and neutralize threats without any human intervention. This innovative and resilient business model is evidenced by a 34% year-over-year increase in its Annual Recurring Revenue or ARR last quarter.\n\nAs you might expect with a company providing a five-year revenue CAGR of 65%, the stock is trading at a high multiple. Shares of CRWD trade at 27.5x sales and 88.5x forward earnings. However, given its current hyper-growth focus, CRWD definitely remains one of the cybersecurity stocks to buy for those looking to join the millionaire\u2019s club in 2025.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) was originally a firewall business that has recently migrated into cybersecurity. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $335.87, about 5.0% higher than the current price. The Street\u2019s higher target for PANW sits at a lofty $405 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis company started off with network security and firewalls, which might tell you about how long Palo Alto has been around. However, its focus more on cybersecurity and cloud security as of recent has reflected its decision to move into new markets and strengthen its competitive edge. One of its biggest developments is its integration of AI into its services with its new Precision AI\u2122, which allows customers to increase their ability to block more advanced threats. For investors looking for potential driving catalysts, Palo Alto has recently come under more coverage ever since headlines of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi taking a bullish call position in the stock worth up to $1.25 million.\n\nDue to its current business model shift, it\u2019s no wonder the stock has taken quite a hit in its last quarterly earnings and valuation metrics. However, PANW\u2019s current 14.8x sales and 51x forward earnings have also opened up the opportunity to a relatively discounted company when compared to CRWD. While CRWD does provide more upside to investors, I would suggest all investors look out for PANW\u2019s upcoming earnings on May 20th to see how PANW intends to continue evolving.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building. Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile SentinelOne (NYSE:S) is a much smaller company than Crowdstrike and Palo Alto Networks, this rapidly growing cybersecurity is definitely one worth keeping your eye on. So far, this stock has flown under the radar as shares are down nearly 15%, lagging behind both its sector and the benchmark S&P 500. Nonetheless, analysts do still hold out hope for SentinelOne with a street-high target of $40 \u2014 nearly double its stock price today. \r\n\r\nSentinelOne\u2019s offerings are often compared to the likes of Crowdstrike, whose Falcon platform is often competitively pitted against SentinelOne\u2019s Singularity. However, upon closer look, it\u2019s interesting to see Singularity\u2019s edge in relatively faster cybersecurity response and ability to work without an internet connection. While it does have some flaws in its scalability, we see this as largely combated by SentinelOne\u2019s highly sticky and satisfied customer base, and a potential channel for SentinelOne to grow market size in the future.\n\nSentinelOne recently reported strong financial results. Not only did the company report an industry-leading revenue growth of 47%, but it saw operating margins improve by more than 30 points YOY. Given that SentinelOne is already making improvements to shift to larger recurring enterprises to strengthen its competitive edge, investors should definitely keep this high-risk, high-reward company on their radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Reuters / Reuters)\n\nTrump Media (DJT)\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300m during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced.\n\nThe company disclosed a net loss of $327.6m (\u00a3257.6m) in the first quarter of the year, with total revenue at $770,500, according to its earnings report.\n\nTrump Media said collected $770,500 in revenue in the first quarter, largely from its \u201cnascent advertising initiative\u201d. That was down from $1.1m a year earlier.\n\nThe company said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274m as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe public debut of Trump Media was a boon to Trump, who owns a nearly 65% stake, worth about $6bn.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European markets make shaky start as oil prices dip\n\n\u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW)\n\nShares of Palo Alto Networks tumbled in pre-market trading, triggered by the company's decision to narrow its full-year guidance.\n\nFor Q3, the cybersecurity company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.32 (\u00a31.02) compared to an estimated $1.26. Revenue of $2bn was slightly better than the expectations of $1.97bn.\n\nOperating income in the quarter came in at $508m, up 25% year-over-year, while Palo Alto Network\u2019s operating margin grew 200 basis points year-over-year, to 25.6%.\n\nFor the full year, Palo Alto Networks sees billings of $10.13bn to $10.18bn, a narrower range than the previously forecasted $10.1bn to $10.2bn and short of the $10.19bn estimate.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe company sees adjusted earnings per share of $5.56 to $5.58. Full-year revenue is estimated to be $7.99bn to $8.01bn, an increase from the prior guidance of $7.95bn to $8bn, and better than the $7.98bn estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe have remained disciplined in our execution while investing in go-to-market and innovation,\u201d Chief financial officer Dipak Golechha said. \u201cWe delivered consistent, profitable growth yet again in Q3 and look forward to executing against our strategic goals and financial targets as we close out the year.\u201d\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN.L)\n\nAstraZeneca said it expects to deliver $80bn (\u00a362.9bn) in total revenue by 2030 as it is poised to launch 20 new medicines.\n\nThe Anglo-Swedish drugs makers aid it would also be boosted by growth in its existing oncology, biopharmaceuticals and rare disease portfolio.\n\n\u201cToday AstraZeneca announces a new era of growth,\u201d said chief executive Pascal Soriot. \u201cThe breadth of our portfolio together with continued investment in innovation supports sustained growth well past the end of the decade.\u201d\n\nKingfisher (KGF.L)\n\nKingfisher has held its guidance for the year, as the firm posted improving sales in its UK and Ireland market despite a decline in \u201cbig-ticket\u201d sales.\n\nThe company, which owns B&Q, TradePoint and Screwfix in the UK, along with European chains Castorama, Brico D\u00e9p\u00f4t and Ko\u00e7ta\u015f, reported total sales of \u00a33.26bn for the three months to 30 April, down 0.3% on a reported basis but up 0.3% at constant currencies.\n\nOn a like-for-like basis, sales were down 0.9%, with growth in the UK and Ireland, Poland, Iberia and Romania offset by a 5.3% drop in France, which it said was \"broadly in line with [a] weaker market\".\n\nKingfisher has seen a more than 6% dip in \"big ticket\" items group-wide, as shaky consumer confidence continues to bite. These high-cost purchases, such as kitchens and bathrooms, account for roughly 15% of Kingfisher's total turnover.\n\nKingfisher said its second quarter has started in line with the underlying sales trends of the first, with group like-for-like sales down 2.5% in the three weeks to 18 May. Kingfisher expects to deliver around \u00a3120m of additional cost reductions and productivity gains this year, which will partially offset higher pay rates and technology investments.\n\nAs a result, the group is maintaining its current guidance for full year adjusted pre-tax profit of around \u00a3490m to \u00a3550m.\n\nWatch: The two areas to invest in to take full advantage of inflation<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^DJI</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^IXIC</a>, <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">^GSPC</a>) and whether stocks <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-nasdaq-clinches-record-close-jpmorgan-drags-down-dow-190821366.html\\\">can hold onto the current rally.</a></p>\\n<p>Guilfoyle joins <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/julie-hyman/?.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">Julie Hyman</a> on Asking for a Trend to elaborate on the areas he is investing, taking advantage of the high inflationary environment: the utilities sector (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:6;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLU\\\">XLU</a>) and <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:7;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-perfect-storm-commodities-now-210157594.html\\\">precious metal commodities</a> such as gold (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:8;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F\\\">GC=F</a>), silver (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:9;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SI=F/\\\">SI=F</a>), and copper (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:10;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HG%3DF/\\\">HG=F</a>).</p>\\n<p>\\\"As AI goes, as bitcoin (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:11;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD&.tsrc=fin-srch\\\">BTC-USD</a>) goes on, as electric vehicles go on, the demand for electricity isn't going to be what it's been.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) tumbled more than 8% in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday, after analysts flagged that the group's latest billings forecast disappointed elevated expectations.\n\nLike other cybersecurity firms, Palo Alto has been facing weakness in spending by clients concerned by an uncertain economic environment. Customers, wary of the possible risks posed by placing all of their digital security needs in the hands of one company after a recent spate of high-profile breaches, are also investing in multiple vendors.\n\nIn a post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Nikesh Arora noted that Palo Alto's ongoing attempt to consolidate its users on to one centralized system -- a process dubbed \"platformization\" -- has enjoyed \"initial traction.\" However, he said this strategy has driven an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted billings, adding that this trend is \"something we expect will continue.\"\n\nPalo Alto's billings outlook ranged from $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter and $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion for the financial year, roughly meeting expectations. Current-quarter earnings per share, meanwhile, are seen at $1.40 to $1.42, which brackets consensus estimates of $1.41. Revenue is projected between $2.15 billion and $2.17 billion, in line with the consensus of $2.16 billion.\n\n\"Clearly investors had been hopeful for more, as the stock price crept up since early April in anticipation of earnings,\" analysts at Bernstein said in a note to clients. As of Monday's close, Palo Alto's share price had risen by nearly 15% over the past one-month period.\n\nRevenue jumped by 15% to $2.0 billion in the three months ended on April 30, surpassing both consensus forecasts of $1.97 billion and the previous year's $1.7 billion. Adjusted per-share income for the quarter came in at $1.32, compared to Wall Street predictions of $1.25.\n\nThe company's remaining performance obligations grew by 23% year-over-year to $11.3 billion, slightly above estimates of $11.28 billion. Chief Financial Officer Dipak Golechha said the returns were partly boosted by \"disciplined\" execution and investments in innovation.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, Palo Alto said it expects to deliver revenue of $7.99 billion to $8.01 billion, up from the previous range of $7.95 billion to $8.00 billion. Analysts had called for $7.98 billion.\n\n\"While there is some logic with Palo Alto Networks\u2019 strategy of Platformization, we can\u2019t help but wonder whether all the extraneous talk has more to do with simply a slowdown in the business, partially related to the macro backdrop, but perhaps there\u2019s more than this,\" analysts at Guggenheim said in a note. \"But sifting through all the noise, results are fine.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSenad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPalo Alto Networks shares drop 8% premarket as billings outlook disappoints\n\nExclusive-Apple supplier Foxconn among firms asked to cut power use in Vietnam, sources say\n\nEarnings call: Xcel Brands sees licensing revenue growth amid wholesale exit\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures tread water as markets gear up for much-anticipated earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) this week and assess fresh interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers. Shares in Palo Alto Networks slip in extended hours trading after the cybersecurity group's fourth-quarter billings forecast fails to impress analysts. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) shakes up the leadership of its semiconductor division in a bid to keep pace in the race to roll out AI-specialized chips.\n\n1. Futures tread water\n\nU.S. futures hovered around the flatline on Tuesday, as investors looked ahead to quarterly earnings from artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia later this week and gauge interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve officials.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures had inched higher by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had edged down by 9 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the stand-out performer in the prior session, with the tech-heavy index closing at an all-time record high thanks to bubbling enthusiasm over the upcoming results from Nvidia. Markets are keen to see if the semiconductor group, whose chips have made it a focal point of booming interest in the possible applications of AI, will deliver yet another quarter of massive growth despite increasing competition.\n\nCommentary from several Fed policymakers, meanwhile, indicated that the central bank still wants to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably cooling to its 2% target before rolling out any possible interest rate reductions this year. But the statements did little to persuade traders to recalculate wagers that the Fed will unveil a cut as soon as September.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks posts disappointing billings forecast\n\nShares in Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) slipped in extended hours trading after the group's outlook for fourth-quarter billings received a tepid response from some analysts.\n\nLike other cybersecurity firms, Palo Alto has been facing weakness in spending by clients concerned by an uncertain economic environment. Customers, wary of the possible risks posed by placing all of their digital security needs in the hands of one company after a recent spate of high-profile breaches, are also investing in multiple vendors.\n\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Executive Nikesh Arora noted that Palo Alto's ongoing attempt to consolidate its users on to one centralized platform has enjoyed \"initial traction.\" However, he said this strategy has driven an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted billings, adding that this trend is \"something we expect will continue.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto estimates that fourth-quarter billings will be between $3.43 billion and $3.48 billion, roughly in line with estimates at the midpoint. But analysts cited by Reuters called the guidance \"lackluster.\"\n\nElsewhere on the earnings front on Tuesday, DIY-retailer Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) and aftermarket auto parts seller AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) are due to report prior to the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\n3. More Fed speak ahead\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller is set to be latest official from the central bank to deliver public comments this week, with markets on the lookout for any clues about the path ahead for interest rates.\n\nWaller will speak on the outlook for the U.S. economy, according to the Fed's events calendar.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues sounded a mostly cautious note on Monday, saying that they have yet to see sufficient evidence that a cooldown in U.S. inflation will be long-lasting. As a result, they largely suggested that rates will need to stay at their currently elevated level of 5.25% to 5.5% until there is more proof that price pressures are abating.\n\nThe Fed's next policy meeting is slated for June 11-12. Traders are widely betting that officials will leave rates unchanged at the gathering.\n\n4. Samsung Electronics taps new head for chip unit\n\nSamsung Electronics has named a new head of its semiconductor division, as the South Korean manufacturer looks to keep pace with its rivals in the ongoing race to develop AI-optimized chips.\n\nMemory chip veteran Young Hyun Jun has been appointed to helm the unit, replacing Kyehyun Kyung, Samsung said on Tuesday. The company argued that the shake-up will strengthen the segment's competitiveness \"amid an uncertain global business environment.\"\n\nThe move comes as analysts are flagging that Samsung is trailing peer SK Hynix in the intensifying push to develop the high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nSamsung, which is targeting a tripling of its HBM supply this year, has already begun mass production of its HBM3E chips, according to the Financial Times.\n\n5. Oil dips\n\nCrude prices fell Tuesday, extending losses posted in the previous session, on worries high U.S. interest rates will hit economic activity in the world\u2019s largest consumer this year.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.7% lower at $78.78 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.7% to $83.14 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell less than 1% on Monday as U.S. Federal Reserve officials said they were awaiting more signs of slowing inflation before considering interest rate cuts.\n\nPolitical uncertainty in Iran, following the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, as well as concerns over the Saudi King\u2019s health have also presented some risk for the crude markets.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures muted, Palo Alto Networks' billings forecast - what's moving markets\n\nGermany property trough worsens as foreign investors scale back\n\nNew Thai finance minister has chance to improve strained central bank ties, says ex-Finance Minister\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PANW) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 17% over the last month. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Palo Alto Networks'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palo Alto Networks is:\n\n52% = US$2.3b \u00f7 US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.52 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Earnings Growth And 52% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Palo Alto Networks has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 51% net income growth seen by Palo Alto Networks over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Palo Alto Networks' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PANW? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nPalo Alto Networks doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Palo Alto Networks' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "content": "Monday, May 20th, 2024\r\n\r\nRecord-high closes on the Dow take a break today. After opening the first session of the trading week higher, the blue-chip index slipped into the red around lunchtime and was not able to recover, -0.49%, or -196 points \u2014 back below the 40,003 close on Friday. The S&P 500 came closer to a new record high close \u2014 +0.09% to 5308 \u2014 while the Nasdaq\u2019s +108 points for the session, +0.65%, did bring the tech-heavy index to a fresh closing high: 16,794. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up +0.32% today.\r\n\r\nThe Dow was led today by +1.2% growth in Microsoft MSFT upon its unveiling of AI unit CoPilot+. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase JPM was a drag on the blue chips today, -4.5%, on the assertion from CEO Jamie Dimon that his eminent retirement is \u201ccloser than ever\u201d (aren\u2019t all of ours?). Dimon has spent 18 years at the helm of the banking giant, which came after the merge between JPM and Bank One in late 2004. Since then, JPM has expanded more than +320% in share price.\r\n\r\nAfter the close, Palo Alto Networks PANW is out with earnings results. Fiscal Q4 earnings of $1.32 per share outpaced expectations by 7 cents (and above the $1.10 per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on revenues of $1.98 billion, a hair above the $1.97 billion in the Zacks consensus. Next-quarter guidance is slightly above where previous expectations had been, but shares are still trading down -9% in the after-market. Palo Alto has given back most of its +12% gains year to date, but is still up almost +60% from a year ago.\r\n\r\nZoom Media ZM also has reported earnings this afternoon. Q1 earnings of $1.35 per share surpassed the $1.19 anticipated, on $1.14 billion in quarterly sales, which notched slightly ahead of the $1.13 billion estimate. Full-year guidance remains in-line with consensus forecasts, but current-quarter guides are a bit light. Shares are down -2% on this development. Neither Zoom nor Palo Alto Networks have any negative earnings surprises in their relatively brief time as publicly traded equities.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, Q1 earnings season continues to fill in the gaps remaining. In the morning, we\u2019ll hear from Macy\u2019s M, Lowe\u2019s LOW and AutoZone AZO ahead of the open, while top-tier homebuilder Toll Brothers TOL and Urban Outfitters URBN. Retail companies are generally among the last sector to report in an earnings season, as they tend to push back their holiday shopping season results and close in late January, April, July and October instead of the more typical December, March, June and September.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Palo Alto Networks Inc. slid in late trading after giving a downbeat sales forecast for the current period, renewing concerns about a slowdown in cybersecurity services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIran State TV Says \u2018No Sign of Life\u2019 at Helicopter Crash Site Speedier Wall Street Trades Are Putting Global Finance On Edge Jamie Dimon Says Succession at JPMorgan Is \u2018Well on the Way\u2019 One of the Last Big Bears on Wall Street Turns Bullish on US Stocks Hims Debuts $199 Weight-Loss Shots at 85% Discount to Wegovy\n\nRevenue in the fiscal fourth quarter will be $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, the company said in a statement Monday. Analysts had anticipated a number at the high end of that range, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe tepid outlook follows another disappointing quarterly report in February, when Palo Alto Networks shares suffered their worst single-day drop ever. At the time, Chief Executive Officer Nikesh Arora said customers were facing \u201cspending fatigue\u201d in cybersecurity. That stoked fears that clients were tightening their budgets in spite of an uptick in attacks.\n\nIn after-market trading Monday, the shares declined as much as 10% to $291.55. That wiped out the stock\u2019s 9.8% gain this year through the close. Shares of peers Crowdstrike Holdings Inc., Zscaler Inc. and Fortinet Inc. also dropped in extended trading.\n\nFourth-quarter billings \u2014 a closely watched benchmark \u2014 will be $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion in the period, which runs through July, Palo Alto Networks said. Analysts had estimated $3.47 billion.\n\nShorter contracts and strategy changes have been weighing on bookings at Palo Alto Networks, Bloomberg Intelligence said. But management expects growth to pick up in the second half of 2024.\n\nIn a call with analysts following the results, Arora said cyberattacks continue unabated. He highlighted attacks by sophisticated nation-state actors and others that he said can wreak damage on systems they hack into within a matter of hours.\n\nArora said he expects cybersecurity spending to continue, adding that many are focused on securing the cloud.\n\n\u201cOn spending for cybersecurity, we see no change in the space or trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cMost customers have a series of projects they want to get done and the only limiting factor seems to be the execution capability.\u201d\n\nAn April report backed by the US government highlighted the risks of cloud computing. It cited multiple problems with Microsoft Corp. specifically but also raised concerns more widely about the ability of nation-state actors to compromise cloud service systems with increasing sophistication.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven so, Palo Alto Networks and its peers have been suffering from a slowdown in firewall sales, according to Westpark Capital, while other product categories are facing \u201cintense competition.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s third-quarter revenue rose 15% to $1.98 billion, marking the slowest growth since the start of 2020. Earnings came in at $1.32 a share, excluding some items. Still, both figures topped analysts\u2019 estimates.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company reported a 3% rise in billings for the quarter, the smallest gain since its initial public offering in 2012.\n\n(Updates share reaction in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNetflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.60%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this security software maker would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of 12.31%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nPalo Alto , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $1.98 billion for the quarter ended April 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.72 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPalo Alto shares have added about 7.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for Palo Alto?\n\nWhile Palo Alto has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Palo Alto: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.40 on $2.16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.50 on $7.98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Software is currently in the top 20% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Veeva Systems (VEEV), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on May 30.\n\nThis provider of cloud-based software services for the life sciences industry is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +57.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nVeeva Systems' revenues are expected to be $641.73 million, up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks's (NASDAQ:PANW) Q1 Sales Beat Estimates But Stock Drops\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) reported Q1 CY2024 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue up 15.3% year on year to $1.98 billion. The company expects next quarter's revenue to be around $2.16 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $1.32 per share, improving from its profit of $1.10 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Palo Alto Networks? Find out in our full research report.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $1.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.97 billion (small beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $1.32 vs analyst estimates of $1.25 (5.6% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q2 CY2024 is $2.16 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Revenue Guidance for CY2024 was slightly raised to $8.00 billion at the midpoint, roughly in line with expectations of $7.99 billion Gross Margin (GAAP): 74.1%, up from 72.4% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $102.6 billion\n\n\"We are pleased with the enthusiastic response to platformization from our customers in Q3. Platformization is a long-term strategy that addresses the increasing sophistication and volume of threats, and the need for AI-infused security outcomes,\" said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. The migration of businesses to the cloud and employees working remotely in insecure environments is increasing demand modern cloud-based network security software, which offers better performance at lower cost than maintaining the traditional on-premise solutions, such as expensive specialized firewall hardware.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, Palo Alto Networks's revenue growth has been strong over the last three years, growing from $1.07 billion in Q3 2021 to $1.98 billion this quarter. Palo Alto Networks Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Palo Alto Networks's quarterly revenue was once again up 15.3% year on year. However, its growth did slow down compared to last quarter as the company's revenue increased by just $9.7 million in Q1 compared to $97 million in Q4 CY2023. While we'd like to see revenue increase by a greater amount each quarter, a one-off fluctuation is usually not concerning.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that Palo Alto Networks is expecting revenue to grow 10.6% year on year to $2.16 billion, slowing down from the 26% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Looking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 12.3% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nProfitability\n\nWhat makes the software as a service business so attractive is that once the software is developed, it typically shouldn't cost much to provide it as an ongoing service to customers. Palo Alto Networks's gross profit margin, an important metric measuring how much money there's left after paying for servers, licenses, technical support, and other necessary running expenses, was 74.1% in Q1. Palo Alto Networks Gross Margin (GAAP)\n\nThat means that for every $1 in revenue the company had $0.74 left to spend on developing new products, sales and marketing, and general administrative overhead. Palo Alto Networks's gross margin is around the average of a typical SaaS businesses. It's encouraging to see its gross margin remain stable, indicating that Palo Alto Networks is controlling its costs and not under pressure from its competitors to lower prices.\n\nKey Takeaways from Palo Alto Networks's Q1 Results\n\nRevenue beat by a small amount and operating profit as well as EPS beat by more convincing amounts. Billings and revenue guidance for next quarter was roughly in line. Full year billings and revenue guidance were also roughly in line. After last quarter's poor results and cautious commentary, the market was likely hoping for better results. The stock is down 6.7% after reporting, trading at $302.32 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Palo Alto Networks right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was\u00a0$278.8 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net income of $107.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was $454.9 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $359.4 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter 2023. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP information is contained in the tables below.\n\n\"We are pleased with the enthusiastic response to platformization from our customers in Q3. Platformization is a long-term strategy that addresses the increasing sophistication and volume of threats, and the need for AI-infused security outcomes,\" said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.\n\n\"We have remained disciplined in our execution while investing in go-to-market and innovation,\" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. \"We delivered consistent, profitable growth yet again in Q3 and look forward to executing against our strategic goals and financial targets as we close out the year.\"\n\nFinancial Outlook Palo Alto Networks provides guidance based on current market conditions and expectations.\n\nFor the fiscal fourth quarter 2024, we expect:\n\nTotal billings in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 9% and 10%. Total revenue in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 10% and 11%. Diluted non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $1.40 to $1.42, using 345 million to 347 million shares outstanding.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, we are updating guidance and expect:\n\nTotal billings in the range of $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion, representing year-over-year growth of between 10% and 11%. Total revenue in the range of $7.99 billion to $8.01 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 26.8% to 27.0%. Diluted non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $5.56 to $5.58, using 343 million to 344 million shares outstanding. Adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 38.5% to 39.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, restructuring and other costs, non-cash charges related to convertible notes, foreign currency gains (losses), and income tax and other tax adjustments related to our long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate, along with certain non-recurring expenses and certain non-recurring cash flows. We have not reconciled diluted non-GAAP net income per share guidance to GAAP net income per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow margin guidance to GAAP net cash from operating activities because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net income or net cash from operating activities and would not be able to present the various reconciling cash and non-cash items between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures because certain items that impact these measures are uncertain or out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including share-based compensation expense, without unreasonable effort. The actual amounts of such reconciling items will have a significant impact on the company's GAAP net income per diluted share and GAAP net cash from operating activities.\n\nEarnings Call Information Palo Alto Networks will host a video webcast for analysts and investors to discuss the company's fiscal third quarter 2024 results as well as the outlook for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 today at 4:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern time/1:30\u00a0p.m. Pacific time.

There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: developments and changes in general market, political, economic, and business conditions; failure of our platformization product offerings; failure to achieve the expected benefits of our strategic partnerships and acquisitions; risks associated with managing our growth; risks associated with new products and subscription and support offerings; shifts in priorities or delays in the development or release of new offerings, or the failure to timely develop and achieve market acceptance of new products and subscriptions as well as existing products and subscription and support offerings; failure of our business strategies; rapidly evolving technological developments in the market for security products and subscription and support offerings; defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings; our customers' purchasing decisions and the length of sales cycles; our competition; our ability to attract and retain new customers; our ability to acquire and integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner; our debt repayment obligations; and our share repurchase program, which may not be fully consummated or enhance shareholder value, and any share repurchases which could affect the price of our common stock.\n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available on our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics Palo Alto Networks has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are helpful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the company's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures or key metrics.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the company's historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. Palo Alto Networks defines non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by total revenue. The company defines non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, and restructuring and other costs. The company believes that non-GAAP operating margin provides management and investors with greater visibility into the underlying performance of the company's core business operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP net income and net income per share, diluted. Palo Alto Networks defines non-GAAP net income as net income plus share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, restructuring and other costs, and non-cash charges related to convertible notes. The company also excludes from non-GAAP net income foreign currency gains (losses) and tax adjustments related to our long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate in order to provide a complete picture of the company's recurring core business operating results. The company defines non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the potentially dilutive effect of the company's employee equity incentive plan awards and the company's convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants, after giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the company's note hedge agreements, which reduces the potential economic dilution that otherwise would occur upon conversion of the company's convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the note hedge is not reflected in diluted shares outstanding. The company considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that it uses non-GAAP operating margin.\n\nBillings. Palo Alto Networks defines billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. The company considers billings to be a key metric used by management to manage the company's business and believes billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of the company's business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The company considers billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if sales of subscriptions continue to increase and the company experiences strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. In particular, the billings metric reported by the company includes amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Additionally, many of the adjustments to the company's GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in the company's financial results for the foreseeable future, such as share-based compensation, which is an important part of Palo Alto Networks employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that Palo Alto Networks excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Palo Alto Networks compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. In the future, the company may also exclude non-recurring expenses and other expenses that do not reflect the company's core business operating results.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Networks Palo Alto Networks is the world's cybersecurity leader.

Palo Alto has impressive demand growth drivers\n\nCybersecurity threats are a widespread issue that is becoming more prevalent. A 2022 report from Gartner, claimed that supply chain attacks are expected to affect nearly 50% of organizations globally in some form by 2025. Very few industries are immune to this problem. The number of data breaches is increasing around 20% annually, while Internet of Things malware attack volume is rising over 35% per year. The cost of cybercrime is expected to surpass $20 trillion by 2027, nearly quadrupling over five years.\n\nThese are serious concerns for consumers and businesses of all sizes. Since cybercrime is an expensive challenge that's not going away, demand for cybersecurity products has a clear set of growth drivers. Analysts expect the cybersecurity industry to grow 10%-12% annually over the medium term. This outpaces many sectors of the economy, creating an excellent growth environment for whichever vendors achieve competitive success. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Palo Alto offers a quality product which gives its stock a wide economic moat\n\nPalo Alto Networks' product suite provides a competitive advantage to maximize those industry demand drivers. The company maintains a broad portfolio of solutions that cover network security, cloud security, and security operations. High-profile industry analysts and product ratings outlets recognize Palo Alto as an industry leader in numerous areas. Brand strength and reputation are meaningful to customers.\n\nThere's also a competitive edge for incumbents in the cybersecurity space. Palo Alto collects a large volume of valuable data as one of the industry leaders. AI is likely to play a role in threat detection and monitoring in the future, and competitors with the best data sets have an advantage in training their AI solutions.\n\nPalo Alto derives a wide economic moat from that size and scale. It is expensive and cumbersome for customers to switch to competitive solutions. Customers are often satisfied with a single, high-reputation vendor that can address many of their cybersecurity needs. It's not always efficient for chief security officers or chief technology officers to deal with multiple vendors rather than a single, trustworthy service provider.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Palo Alto is generating consistent growth\n\nPalo Alto's financial results illustrate the strengths covered above. The company has delivered consistent revenue growth, and its free cash flow expanded even faster. PANW Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nThe company's top-line growth rate is slowing due to macroeconomic factors. Its large customer base and broad product portfolio also reduce the number of unpenetrated potential markets. Nonetheless, Palo Alto Networks management forecasts roughly 20% expansion moving forward, which is a respectable rate. The company recently became profitable on a GAAP basis, so its bottom line is growing much more quickly than its sales.\n\n4. Palo Alto maintains efficient operations\n\nPalo Alto's growth is accompanied by impressive operational efficiency. The company's gross margin recently bounced back to 74% after sliding lower for several years. That helped to propel it into a profitable range. Its 40% free-cash-flow margin and return on invested capital (ROIC) are both impressive. PANW Gross Profit Margin Chart\n\nThese metrics suggest that Palo Alto efficiently uses its financial resources to generate profits. High-growth companies often burn cash or maintain low profit margins as they invest in product quality or marketing. Palo Alto's margin profile and efficiency metrics indicate that the company can capitalize on demand without spending too much or bending on price.\n\n5. Palo Alto has a reasonable valuation\n\nPalo Alto's forward P/E ratio is just under 50, and its price-to-cash-flow ratio is 45. Neither of those valuation ratios is particularly cheap, but they are both reasonable compared to the company's forecasted growth rate. If Palo Alto can deliver on its 20% revenue growth forecast and achieve a slightly faster pace on cash flow expansion, then its PEG ratio is between 2 and 2.5, depending on your methodology.\n\nThat valuation is expensive enough to result in short-term volatility, but this isn't expensive enough to compromise long-term returns. If Palo Alto realizes its potential over the next five to 10 years, then the stock can deliver big gains for shareholders.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The AI Stock Underdogs: 7 Underappreciated Companies Poised for Greatness",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence has taken over business headlines for good reason. Yet, investors may be better served, at this juncture, focusing on underappreciated AI stocks. Why? Primarily, it comes down to the impact of a crowded trade.\n\nYes, you can pile your funds into the usual suspects such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, the market never sees assets rise in perfectly linear fashion indefinitely because it\u2019s difficult to sustain rising expectations. That\u2019s especially the case for Nvidia. With so many blistering earnings performances, at some point, it will miss.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when that miss will occur. So, it\u2019s a financial game of Russian roulette.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn the other hand, hidden gems in the AI space could have longer legs, mainly because so few expect them to do anything. By opening the doors to non-tech enterprises, investors may be able to enjoy surprising profits. With that, below are underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen you think of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), chances are, AI isn\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind. However, it\u2019s a clear beneficiary of digital intelligence. For example, the big-box retailer has started incorporating conversation AI into its business. With its voice shopping interface, customers can shop as fast as they can talk and text.\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s a consistent performer, allowing investors the ability to sleep easy at night. In the four quarters since the period ending April 30, 2024, Walmart\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 7.88%. It\u2019s not an astounding print but it gets the job done.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts are looking at earnings per share of $2.38 on revenue of $674.53 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $2.22 on sales of $648.12 billion. In the following year, these metrics could improve to earnings of $2.61 per share on sales of $700.54 billion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not exciting, the reliability factor makes WMT one of the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) isn\u2019t exactly a technology player. However, it\u2019s one of the underappreciated AI stocks thanks to the underlying deployment of the innovation. Last year, the Golden Arches made news when it opened a new automated restaurant in Texas. Rather than the traditional means of picking up orders, customers can take advantage of a conveyer-belt-fed system.\n\nOn a financial note, McDonald\u2019s is very appealing because of its consistency. Yes, in the first quarter of 2024, the company incurred a small miss regarding its bottom-line target. However, in the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.93%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts anticipate EPS of $12.20 on sales of $26.62 billion. That\u2019s a sizable improvement over last year\u2019s results of $11.15 EPS on revenue of $23.82 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 could see the bottom line rise to $13.28 per share with a top line of $28.14 billion. With a decent forward dividend yield of 2.45%, MCD ranks among the underappreciated AI stocks.\n\nKroger (KR) Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nGrocery giant Kroger (NYSE:KR) makes sense in any context because of a cynical reality: people must eat. But KR is also one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Not too long ago, the company announced AI capabilities to its online marketplace. This new interface should give Kroger customers a superior experience via more informative product listings.\n\nOn a financial level, a key reason for investing in KR stock is the underlying consistency. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, 2024, the grocer\u2019s positive average earnings surprise clocked in at 7.98%. On a trailing-12-month basis, Kroger features a net income of $2.15 billion. Its profit margin comes in at 1.44%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are seeking EPS of $4.42 on revenue of $148.73 billion. That\u2019s a downgrade from last year\u2019s results of $4.76 EPS on sales of $150.04 billion. However, there could be a gradual improvement to earnings of $4.55 per share on sales of $151.36 billion in the following year.\n\nDeere (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most important companies due to its relevance to the agriculture industry, Deere (NYSE:DE) also ranks among underappreciated AI stocks. A key innovation that the company forwarded is its autonomous tractor. First, such autonomy may offer force multiplication for farmers. Second, because fewer people are interested in a farming career, these smart tractors could address sector labor shortages.\n\nFor investors, DE stock has attracted demand due to the pertinence to a critical ecosystem. Also, it\u2019s a consistent performer. Since fiscal Q1, Deere\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to just under 16%. That\u2019s mighty impressive. Also, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 1.48%.\n\nMoving forward, analysts anticipate a tricky narrative, with EPS coming down to $26.81 on sales of $48.08 billion by the end of this year. That compares disappointingly to 2023\u2019s print of $34.69 EPS on revenue of $55.56 billion. Still, with the consistently robust performances recently, it wouldn\u2019t be shocking to see Deere prove doubters wrong again.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA healthcare juggernaut, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the most trusted investments for the long haul. It also happens to be one of the underappreciated AI stocks. Notably, the company earned a spot in Fast Company\u2019s 2022 \u201cMost Innovative Companies\u201d list. One featured innovation was J&J\u2019s AI-powered C-SATS platform, which allows surgeons to connect any operating room to the cloud.\n\nAside from a small miss in Q2 2023, the healthcare giant has been consistent with its earnings performances. In the past four quarters, its average positive surprise came out to 1.6%. It\u2019s not the most exciting enterprise, that much is certain. However, the focus on building the bottom line allows the company to offer a forward dividend yield of 3.21%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS to rise to $10.65 on sales of $88.35 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $9.92 on revenue of $85.16 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to earnings of $10.95 per share with a top line of $90.74 billion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA cybersecurity specialist, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) happens to be a great example of underappreciated AI stocks. Primarily, the focus of digital intelligence centers on \u201caccretive\u201d endeavors; that is, directives that enhance productivity. At the same time, AI could be a force multiplier for nefarious online activities. Therefore, Palo Alto\u2019s AI-focused cybersecurity protocol is a necessity in keeping enterprises safe from harm.\n\nNot surprisingly, the company benefits from robustly consistent performances. In the past four quarters since the period ending Jan. 31, Palo Alto\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 15.53%. On a TTM basis, net income stands at $2.28 billion. Its profit margin is a stout 30.24%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that EPS will rise to $5.51 on sales of $7.98 billion. That\u2019s a big step from last year\u2019s results of earnings of $4.44 per share on revenue of $6.89 billion. For fiscal 2025, EPS of $6.16 with a top line of $9.13 billion may be in the cards. Therefore, it\u2019s one of the underappreciated AI stocks to consider.\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA software firm, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is best known for its TurboTax program. That\u2019s going to be significant moving forward as the gig economy may attract workers. If so, people will transition from being employees to independent contractors and that imposes a more complex tax structure. Invariably, those new to working for themselves will have questions. Here, generative AI can help.\n\nAs an investment, INTU stock is attractive for consistently (and handily) beating its quarterly bottom-line targets. In the past four quarters, Intuit\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 14.9%. On a TTM basis, its net income stand at $2.77 billion. Further, its profit margin clocks in at 18.35%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS of $16.41 on sales of $16.05 billion. Last year, the company posted earnings of $14.40 per share on revenue of $14.37 billion. In fiscal 2025, these metrics could improve to $18.85 EPS with a top line of $18.05 billion. With a potentially expanding total addressable market, Intuit makes for one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009",
        "content": "Cisco Surpasses Estimates As It Finally Gets Some AI Action Despite Steepest Revenue Drop Since 2009\n\nOn Wednesday, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal third quarter results and both its top and bottom-line surpassed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. However, this does not change the fact that revenue suffered its steepest decline in 15 years. Like in its previous quarterly report, Cisco attributed the sales softness by consumers setting up the equipment they received during earlier quarters, stating that it expects such installations to be mostly done by the end of the fiscal year. Despite the revenue decline, its stock still went up 8% during extended trading.\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on April 27th, Cisco reported revenue contracted about 13% as it amounted to\u00a0$12.7 billion, still surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $12.53 billion.\n\nAdjusted earnings amounted to 88 cents per share, also topping LSEG\u2019s consensus of 82 cents. But net income tanked 41% to\u00a0$1.89 billion, or 46 cents per share.\n\nNetworking revenue\u00a0which makes the majority of sales also melted as it dropped by 27% to $6.52 billion.\n\nCisco made a big step forward in the AI direction.\n\nDuring the quarter, the $28 billion\u00a0acquisition of security software maker Splunk was completed and although it lowered the adjusted earnings per share by a penny, it also lifted revenue with a $413 million infusion. Over time, Cisco is expected to lower costs. But what\u2019s more important is that Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Splunk means a big boost in its cybersecurity and AI ambitions, as this is its biggest acquisition in its history that spans over a big less than four decades. With Splunk, Cisco is gaining a tool to face off its rivals, like Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CRWD), and the chance to stay relevant in a universe dominated by vicious tech titans, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon. Com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google. Cisco is well-aware it cannot go alone against the giants anymore which is why it joined forces with its long-time rival Microsoft back in 2022. The response of consumers was so good that Microsoft and Cisco expanded their partnership, offering more solutions. Together, Microsoft and Cisco showed that with joint efforts, they can help their customers even better and power their digital transformation.\n\nCisco Altered Its Fiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nCisco lifted the full year revenue guidance range it provided in February, as it now expects a figure between $53.6 billion and $53.8 billion.\n\nIt also narrowed its adjusted earnings range as it now expects them between $3.69 to $3.71.\u00a0As for\u00a0fiscal 2025 revenue, CFO Scott Herren expects low- to mid-single digits growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins expressed his content that Cisco is\u00a0approaching the end of supply chain challenges it has been struggling with for years. Cisco has undoubtedly been undergoing many changes and although recent quarters have been particularly challenging, Cisco is finally getting some AI action while there are early signs that enterprise spending is starting to recover.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "While the innovation ecosystem has rightfully commanded much of the attention on Wall Street, investors may want to consider profitable tech stocks. As circumstances become more challenging, it\u2019s the substantive enterprises that may last for the long haul.\n\nThat\u2019s not to take anything away from the growth-oriented enterprises. Certainly, the often-smaller companies that eschew profits for expanding their market can potentially see enormous returns. At the same time, they carry tremendous risks.\n\nWith inflation still high and consumers still struggling, it may be prudent to have some exposure to established names. On that note, below are intriguing ideas for profitable tech stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Santa Clara, California, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) focuses on the infrastructure software space. Per its public profile, the company provides cybersecurity solutions worldwide. In particular, it offers firewall appliances and software. It also brings to the table Panorama, a security management solution. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $335.32 average price target.\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 15.53%. On a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, the company has printed net income of $2.28 billion. That said, the company just became profitable.\n\nStill, experts anticipate that the trend will continue to evolve in the right direction. For the current fiscal year, they\u2019re targeting earnings per share of $5.51 on revenue of $7.99 billion. Last year, the company posted EPS of $4.44 on sales of $6.89 billion. For fiscal 2025, earnings could rise to $6.16 on sales of $9.13 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the profitable tech stocks to consider, especially amid the rising cybersecurity threat profile.\n\nGlobalFoundries (GFS) In this photo illustration GlobalFoundries (GFS) Inc. logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Malta, New York, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) operates in the semiconductor space. Per its corporate profile, GlobalFoundries provides a range of mainstream wafer fabrication services and technologies worldwide. It also manufactures various semiconductor devices, including microprocessors, mobile application processors and radio frequency (RF) modems, to name but a few. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $59.33 average price target.\n\nOn a TTM basis, GlobalFoundries features a net income of $899 million. Per Yahoo Finance, the company\u2019s profit margin stands at 12.66%. Its return on equity comes in at 8.31%. In the past four quarters since the end of the first quarter of 2024, GlobalFoundires\u2019 average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 16.38%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe that EPS will land at $1.34 on revenue of $6.68 billion. That\u2019s disappointing compared to last year\u2019s results of $2.24 EPS on sales of $7.39 billion. However, by fiscal 2025, the trend could improve, with EPS possibly rising to $2.07 on revenue of $7.64 billion. Given the importance of semiconductor supply chain diversification, GFS ranks among the top profitable tech stocks to buy.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nHailing from Palo Alto, California, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another semiconductor powerhouse. Per its public profile, the company designs, develops and supplies various computer-chip-related devices with a focus on complex and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices and analog-based products. One of its mainline specialties involves System on Chips (SoCs). It\u2019s a strong buy, with experts projecting a price target of $1,571.55.\n\nFinancially, Broadcom isn\u2019t exactly exciting; rather, it simply gets the job done. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 2.78%. Net income on a TTM basis stands at $11.58 billion. Further, its profit margin comes in at just under 30%, with an operating margin of 31.76%.\n\nAnalysts believe that for fiscal 2024, the company will post EPS of $46.92 on revenue of $50.35 billion. That\u2019s a sizable lift from last year\u2019s print of earnings of $42.25 on sales of $35.82 billion. Further, in fiscal 2025, EPS could improve again to $57 with a top line of $57.27 billion. As a key building block in the innovation space, AVGO is one of the profitable tech stocks.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nA company that really needs no introduction, tech juggernaut Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) involves itself in myriad circles. Most recently, the company has made waves for its huge investments in artificial intelligence, which is paying off handsomely. However, Microsoft also forms the bread and butter of business applications, especially with its Office 365 software. Unsurprisingly, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $489.90 price target.\n\nOver the past four quarters since Q1 2024, Microsoft\u2019s average positive earnings surprise stands at 6.98%. Net income on a TTM basis comes in at $86.18 billion. Currently, quarterly earnings growth is clocking in at an impressive 19.9% on a year-over-year basis. Further, its profit margin is 36.43%, with an operating margin of 44.59%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS will rise to $10.91 on sales of $226.53 billion. That would be another decent performance compared with last year\u2019s results of $9.81 EPS on sales of $211.91 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 EPS could jump to $12.26 with a top line of $259.13 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the profitable tech stocks to buy.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nBased in the Netherlands, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) ranks as one of the most important tech enterprises. Falling under the semiconductor equipment and materials category, ASML develops, markets, sells and services advanced manufacturing systems for chipmakers. Specifically, it\u2019s best known for its lithography systems. Given the massive pertinence of the business, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. The average price target is $1,093.50.\n\nFinancially, as you might expect, it\u2019s a consistent performer. In the past four quarters since Q1, the average quarterly earnings surprise comes in at 8.18%. On a TTM basis, net income lands at $7.11 billion. Further, the company\u2019s profit margin clocks in at 27.23%, while its operating margin is 26.3%. Notably, its return on equity shoots up to 60.28%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that EPS will come in at $20.68 on revenue of $29.96 billion. That\u2019s somewhat disappointing compared to last year\u2019s EPS of $21.22 with a top line of $29.4 billion. However, fiscal 2025 could be a big year, with EPS flying to $32.27 on revenue of $39.7 billion. It\u2019s one of the profitable tech stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nAkamai (AKAM) building facade with akamai (AKAM) logo on it. representing tech stocks\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) specializes in the infrastructure software ecosystem. Per its corporate profile, Akamai provides cloud computing, security and content delivery services in the U.S. and international markets. Specifically, it offers cloud solutions to keep infrastructure, websites and applications protected from cyberattacks. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $116.62 average price target.\n\nAs with other profitable tech stocks on this list, Akamai\u2019s financials aren\u2019t astounding. It gets the job done. In the past four quarters since Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive surprise came out to 5.48%. Net income on a TTM basis lands at $625.94 million. Profit margin is up at 16.12% while the operating margin lands at 16.97%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, experts are looking for EPS of $6.31 on revenue of $3.99 billion. That\u2019s a modest bump up from last year\u2019s print of $6.20 EPS on sales of $3.81 billion. However, in fiscal 2025, the bottom line could hit $6.76 per share with a top line of $4.29 billion.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nBased in San Jose, California, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a powerhouse in the infrastructure software category. Together with its subsidiaries, Adobe operates as a diversified software firm. It operates through three segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. With the gig economy expanding, the company could be an intriguing idea. Analysts believe so, rating shares a moderate buy with a $624.83 price target, implying over 29% upside potential.\n\nFinancially, Adobe\u2019s key to success is consistency rather than outright blistering performances. In the past four quarters since the three months ended Feb. 29, 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise landed at just under 3%. Nominally, net income on a TTM basis reached $4.8 billion. The profit margin stands at 24.08%, with an operating margin of 36.8%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate EPS of $18.03 on revenue of $21.46 billion. That would be a sizable improvement over last year\u2019s results of $14.81 EPS on sales of $17.89 billion. Further, in fiscal 2025, EPS could rise to $20.37 on revenue of $23.93 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed above the key 40,000 level for the first time in history on Friday, rising 134.21 points, or 0.34%, to 40,003.59, after hitting an intraday high in the previous session.\n\nThe S&P 500 inched up 6.17 points, or 0.12%, to 5,303.27, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 12.35 points, or 0.07%, at 16,685.97.\n\nThe week ended strong with the Dow up 1.2%, marking its fifth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.5% and 2.1% week-to-date, achieving their longest winning streak since February.\n\nThis weekly ascent propelled the three indexes into positive territory for the second quarter despite a tough start. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are now both up more than 11% in 2024, while the Dow has climbed more than 6% this year.\n\nFor the week ahead, key economic data releases include the existing home sales report on Wednesday, and the durable goods orders report along with the University of Michigan report on Friday.\n\nMoreover, the minutes from the May Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will be released on Wednesday. Meanwhile, several Fed officials are set to speak throughout the week as well.\n\n\u201cWe expect the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index increased to 67.9 in the final May reading,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists said in a Sunday note.\n\n\u201cWe estimate the report\u2019s measure of long-term inflation expectations remained unchanged at 3.1%, somewhat above the recent trend, reflecting higher gasoline prices and the higher-than-expected price data reported in 2024,\u201d they added.\n\nInvestors await Nvidia, Target earnings reports\n\nSo far, roughly 93% of the companies in the S&P 500 index have reported their latest earnings, with profits proving more resilient than expected.\n\nOverall earnings are up 5.3%, supported by 3.7% revenue growth. Initially, bottom-up estimates had predicted a 3.9% rise in earnings from the previous year. Eight of the 11 sectors are showing positive earnings growth, six of which have witnessed double-digit increases.\n\nAs earnings season winds down, 17 firms are slated to report results this week, followed by another nine the following week.\n\nBy far the most anticipated report for this week will be released by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Wall Street expecting another strong display from the AI darling.\n\nOther prints that will be in the spotlight include Target, Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), and Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), among others.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nOppenheimer: \u201cWe remain positive on equities and continue to see fixed income securities as complimentary to stocks in providing portfolio diversification.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cSome near term profit-taking in the day to day action of the market particularly in segments of the market that have had exceptional run-ups since last year into this year continues to appear to us quite normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch activity combined with a process of rebalancing and rotation into other segments of the stock market in our view can be healthy and should contribute to the broadening of the markets\u2019 progress from last year through this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cNear term volatility could in our view continue to present opportunity for investors to \u201ccatch babies that get thrown out with the bath water\u201d in periods of market down drafts as the market digests levels of uncertainty that are not uncommon to times of transition in monetary policy like these and in periods of rising geopolitical risk.\u201d\n\nBTIG: \u201cThe SPX is coming off four straight up weeks to fresh all-time highs. There are some negative divergences suggesting some consolidation is likely, but clearly the trend remains firmly bullish. The negative momentum and breadth divergences are also accompanied by an increase in speculation as Thursday was the highest Nasdaq Composite volume on record, driven by sub-$1 stocks. The equity put/call ratio is also back to complacent levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this suggests a shallow pause/pullback over coming weeks rather than something more long-lasting. The bigger story, in our view, is the recent breakouts in China and many commodities (gold, silver, copper, uranium, etc) as well as the related equities.\"\n\n\u201cWe think this 'great reflation' trade has more to go and would highlight energy stocks as particularly timely here after a multi-week pullback.\u201d\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cIn the base case, we forecast a 19x P/E multiple on 12-month forward EPS (June 2026) of US$283, which equates to a 5,400 forward 12-month price target.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur 2024 and 2025 earnings growth forecasts (8% and 13%, respectively) assume healthy, mid- single-digit top-line growth in addition to margin expansion in both years as positive operating leverage resumes (particularly in 2025). Modest valuation compression (from ~20x to ~19x in the base case) as earnings adjust higher is typical in a mid-to-late-cycle backdrop (occurred in the mid-1990s, mid- 2000s, and 2018 most recently).\u201d\n\n\u201cNormalization in the market multiple is also a function of a higher risk premium (lower rates are a partial offset), which reflects uncertainty around a wider range of potential outcomes. On this front, our bull (6,350) and bear (4,200) cases represent ~20% upside and downside potential versus the current index level, respectively.\u201d\n\nEvercore ISI: \u201cWith VIX low at 11.99 while SPX trades at a very lofty 23.5x LTM P/E, all eyes turn to NVDA. If results beat consensus expectations, the near term share price reaction will be more difficult to gauge, even as the long term productivity implications of the AI Revolution remain clear. A +/- 8% move priced by Options is complicated by a downtick in AI uptake, falling to 4.7% \u2013 a \u201ckink in the curve\u201d to EVR ISI\u2019s base case of 25% AI adoption by year-end 2025.\"\n\n\u201cOne certain thing is that NVDA\u2019s price reaction will have consequences for SPX as a whole. It always does.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures inch up with Fed minutes, Nvidia results on tap for the week\n\nShah Capital ends campaign against Novavax board after Sanofi deal\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 Earnings Report Preview: What To Look For\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) will be reporting earnings tomorrow afternoon. Here's what to expect.\n\nPalo Alto Networks met analysts' revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $1.98 billion, up 19.3% year on year. It was a weak quarter for the company, with underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and a miss of analysts' billings estimates.\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Palo Alto Networks's revenue to grow 14.3% year on year to $1.97 billion, slowing from the 24.1% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.25 per share. Palo Alto Networks Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Palo Alto Networks has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 0.7% on average.\n\nLooking at Palo Alto Networks's peers in the cybersecurity segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Varonis delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 6.2%, meeting analysts' expectations, and Tenable reported revenues up 14.4%, topping estimates by 1.2%. Varonis's stock price was unchanged after the results, and Tenable's price followed a similar reaction.\n\nRead our full analysis of Varonis's results here and Tenable's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the cybersecurity segment, with share prices up 6.1% on average over the last month. Palo Alto Networks is up 13.1% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $335.5 (compared to the current share price of $318.7).\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

        "title": "Better Cybersecurity Stock: Palo Alto Networks vs. CrowdStrike",
        "content": "Cybersecurity is a massive industry that has never been more important. Hackers are more adept at breaching systems and causing havoc for companies. Precautions must be taken to protect internal and customer data.\n\nThis requires implementing one (or several) cybersecurity solutions, and, as a result, investors should consider adding cybersecurity stocks to their portfolio, as demand for their products is massive.\n\nTwo of the most popular are Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). But which one is the better buy? Let's find out.\n\nPalo Alto and CrowdStrike compete heavily\n\nFirst, let's discuss each company's primary business within the cybersecurity realm.\n\nPalo Alto divides its business into three segments: network security, cloud security, and security operations. Its network security business includes firewalls and a zero-trust platform that prevents outsiders from accessing a network. Its cloud security platform protects cloud workloads, and the security operations platform has products like endpoint security (endpoints are network access devices like laptops) and threat detection response.\n\nCrowdStrike has a similar product lineup, although its initial business wasn't firewalls like Palo Alto. It got its start with a cloud-first security approach that started with endpoint protections and then expanded into other areas like identity protection, cloud security, threat intelligence, and endpoint detection response. So Palo Alto and CrowdStrike are direct competitors in many of their offerings.\n\nBut when you dig into their financials, a leader begins to emerge.\n\nCrowdStrike's growth is projected to remain strong this year\n\nIf you look solely at revenue growth, CrowdStrike seems to have an edge. However, this is a side effect of being a smaller business. This is on full display with CrowdStrike's growth trajectory, as its year-over-year revenue growth is slowing down the larger it gets. PANW Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nWhile CrowdStrike is growing faster than Palo Alto, the roles might be flipped if Palo Alto were the size of CrowdStrike. However, forward-looking indications aren't as bright for Palo Alto.\n\nIn the quarter that ended April 30, Palo Alto is expecting revenue growth of only 3%. (It's scheduled to report earnings results Monday.) This is a massive red flag, especially when compared to CrowdStrike, as well as other cybersecurity companies.\n\nFor the quarter that ended April 30, CrowdStrike expects revenue of around $904 million, indicating 31% growth. (It's scheduled to report earnings results on June 4.) That's quite the difference, and it shows that Palo Alto is struggling.\n\nStory continues\n\nOr is it?\n\nPalo Alto's management said during the February conference call with analysts that its guidance was \"a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in wanting to accelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leadership.\" Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a huge role in powerful cybersecurity products, so this shift makes sense.\n\nHowever, CrowdStrike has been using AI since its inception to automatically detect and deal with threats without human intervention. This has given CrowdStrike an edge over Palo Alto networks in the endpoint protection game.\n\nWhich stock?\n\nTo me, this is all I need to declare CrowdStrike the winner. It already has significant AI experience, while Palo Alto is late to the game.\n\nCrowdStrike is by far the better buy here, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it starting to take some Palo Alto customers in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia earnings are coming but the rally can't continue forever. (AFP Contributor via Getty Images)\n\nEarnings season is coming to an end but some major names are yet to report. Investors have some high expectations for some of the key companies reporting next week such as Nvidia and Marks and Spencer.\n\nHere's what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 Reports on Wednesday 22 May\n\nThe darling of AI and technology investors will report results from its first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on 22 May.\n\nThe AI boom would not be possible without the chips from Nvidia, with the chipmaker seeing shares surge by 239% last year.\n\nWith demand far outstripping supply for its graphics processing units, investors will want to know if Nvidia \u2014 the last of the Mag 7 to report \u2014 can keep driving the AI-related rally the market enjoyed over the past year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNvidia is anticipated to report earnings of $5.49 per share for the current quarter, marking an increase of 403.7% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe earnings are projected to be $23.94 per share and a revenue of $106.05bn (\u00a383.8bn) for the entire fiscal year, according to TradingView.\n\nRead more: Mag 7 stocks including Apple and Amazon still holding strong\n\n\"The AI hype-train is not only rolling but delivering, as far as Nvidia is concerned. Momentum investors seem happy to pile in, although value seekers are likely to be more reticent, given the lofty valuation which leaves little room for error. In the final quarter of fiscal 2023, Nvidia ran a $2.7bn share buyback,\" Russ Mould, investment director, Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis, and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst, all of AJ Bell, wrote.\n\nHowever, investors that want to jump in on the AI race now, hoping that Nvidia will reach even higher highs, might be disappointed.\n\n\"Bears have little to chew upon, barring a meteoric share price rise, a premium valuation and seemingly universal enthusiasm for the stock. The $2.3tn market capitalisation equates to around 40 times this year\u2019s earnings (when the S&P 500 (^GSPC) trades on around 21-22 times, according to research from S&P Global and Capital IQ) and 20 times forecast annual sales,\" they added.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Nvidia is leading the race in the AI \"gold rush\" and a survey revealed that the stock is rivalling gold (GC=F) as a possible hedge against inflation.\n\nGold is still seen as the best safeguard against the risk of rising prices, according to 46% of survey participants. But nearly a third said the tech mega caps are their first pick for the role.\n\nNvidia's chief Jenson Huang received a 60% pay bump in the corporation's fiscal 2024 on the back of a massive rally in the share price.\n\nHuang's package swelled to $34.16m versus $21.35m in the prior year. This was comprised of an unchanged base salary of $996,515, stock awards of $26.67m, non-equity incentive compensation of $4m and all other compensation of $2.494m.\"\n\nMarks & Spencer (MKS.L) \u2014 Reports on Wednesday 22 May\n\n\u200b\u200bInvestors expect Marks & Spencer\u2019s upcoming full year earnings to show an ongoing recovery for the British retailer.\n\nAnalysts have nudged up the consensus underlying pre-tax profit forecast for the year to March 2024 to \u00a3653m, compared to the range of \u00a3550m to \u00a3600m that had prevailed before the interims, according to AJ Bell.\n\n\"Shares in Marks & Spencer are trading very close to five-year highs, and they rank as the second-best performers within the ranks of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) over the past 12 months. However, the share price is almost unchanged in 2024 and that slight loss of momentum may reflect, bottom up, management\u2019s efforts to keep a lid on earnings forecasts and, top down, the delay on the long-awaited interest cuts from the Bank of England,\" the investment platform analysts said.\n\nAdding to the positive sentiment surrounding M&S shares is the recent bullish stance taken by several brokers. Last month, both JPMorgan and Jefferies upgraded the stock to the equivalent of \"buy\" ratings.\n\n\"Such broker upgrades often serve as a positive factor for a stock's performance, as they can influence investor sentiment and attract additional demand,\" Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, wrote.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the dividend forecast stands at 6.2p, representing a yield of 2.3% at the current share price.\n\n\"Notably, this dividend forecast is nearly double the figure for the previous year ended 31 March. With dividends on the rise, M&S could potentially attract a new set of investors seeking passive income streams,\" he added.\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR) \u2014 Reports on Monday 20 May\n\nLow-budget airlines benefited from Easter falling early this year and investors would be keen to see if the Boeing (BA) delivery delays will impact Ryanair's results.\n\nAnalysts expect revenue to have jumped 24% in the year ended 31 March, overcoming delayed Boeing deliveries and issues with third-party online travel agents.\n\nHowever, CEO Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s recent warning that summer ticket prices are not rising as much as expected sent chills through the sector.\n\nAnnual adjusted net income is seen up 33%, although the net loss probably swelled in the fourth quarter, seasonally the company\u2019s weakest, consensus shows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u200bLSEG Refinitiv data shows a consensus analyst rating of \"buy\" for Ryanair with six strong buy, 14 buy and one hold \u2014 and a mean of estimates suggesting a long-term price target of \u20ac25.60 for the share, roughly 34% higher than the current price.\n\nRead more: Eurozone interest rate cut expectations rise as inflation hits 2.4% in April\n\n\u200b\"Ryanair has taken measures to expand its fleet to 536 aircraft as of September 2023 to meet improving travel demand. However, the budget carrier was impacted by over 800 flight cancellations in February due to conflicts between Israel and Gaza,\" Axel Rudolph, market analyst at IG, wrote.\n\n\u200b\"As travel continues recovering from pandemic disruptions, easyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair's ability to contain costs and execute on growth plans will be key for sustaining profitability momentum,\" he added.\n\nDeutsche Bank has warned of another tough year for the European airline industry, but pointed to some positive news for the near term.\n\nUK inflation \u2014Wednesday 22 May\n\nNot a stock, but definitely market moving data that investors will need to watch out for \u2014 the latest UK inflation figures coming out.\n\nThe market's expectation is that headline inflation eased to 2.7% in April and that core inflation retreated to 3.6%.\n\n\"If correct, this should increase the chances of a rate cut in June,\" Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IUG, wrote.\n\nThe consumer prices index dropped to a two and a half-year low of 3.2% in March, according to the Office for National Statistics, which was down from 3.4% the previous month but higher than economists\u2019 forecasts of 3.1%.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, dropped to 4.2% in March from 4.5% in the previous month. Analysts expected a drop to 4.1%.\n\n\"Much hinges on the April CPI data due later in May, which is when we\u2019ll see the results of the annual contract-linked price rises that typically take place at the start of the year. Our rough estimates suggest 40% of the services inflation basket is affected by these annual price hikes to some degree, and last year\u2019s data release was much stronger than expected, prompting the single biggest daily increase in two-year swap rates in 2023 as a whole,\" ING wrote.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) will release the latest figures this Wednesday.\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 20 May\n\nBig Yellow (BYG.L)\n\nKainos (KNOS.L)\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW)\n\nZoom Video Communications (ZM)\n\nTuesday 21 May\n\nCranswick (CWK.L)\n\nPennon (PNN.L)\n\nAssura (AGR.L)\n\nSSP (SSPG.L)\n\nGreencore (GNC.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nKingfisher (KGF.L)\n\nDowlais (DWL.L)\n\nSony (SONY)\n\nAsahi (2502.T)\n\nRakuten (5838.T)\n\nSamsonite (SMSEY)\n\nTencent (0700.HK)\n\nGenerali (G.MI)\n\nLowe\u2019s (LOW)\n\nAutoZone (AZO)\n\nAmer Sports (AS)\n\nMacy\u2019s (M)\n\nUrban Outfitters (URBN)\n\nWednesday 22 May\n\nSSE (SSE.L)\n\nRS Group (RS1.L)\n\nBritish Land (BLND.L)\n\nIntegrafin (IHP.L)\n\nCoats (COA.L)\n\nXiaomi (1810.HK)\n\nSoitec (SOI.PA)\n\nAnalog Devices (ADI)\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nSnowflake (SNOW)\n\nThursday 23 May\n\nNational Grid (NG.L)\n\nJohnson Matthey (JMAT.L)\n\nInternational Distribution Services (IDS.L)\n\nTate & Lyle (TATE.L)\n\nWizz Air (WIZZ.L)\n\nQinetiQ (QQ.L)\n\nBloomsbury Publishing (BMY.L)\n\nGreat Portland Estates (GPE.L)\n\nAviva (AV.L)\n\nPetershill Partners (PHLL.L)\n\nHill & Smith (HILS.L)\n\nMeituan (3690.HK)\n\nLenovo (0992.HK)\n\nMedtronic (MDT)\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR)\n\nRalph Lauren (RL)\n\nPolestar (PSNY)\n\nFriday 24 May\n\nIntertek (ITRK.L)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nWatch: Nvidia: One thing this strategist thinks could threaten growth<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-impacting-q1-earnings-214124185.html\\\">Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative technology,</a> with tech giants increasingly investing in its development.

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that companies are ramping up security spending to combat rising threats. The cybersecurity market is projected to reach $183 billion globally this year, presenting major growth opportunities in cybersecurity stocks. With attacks growing more frequent and costly, businesses simply cannot afford to skimp on protection.\n\nSavvy investors can position themselves to benefit by adding exposure to leading cybersecurity stocks. Their innovative portfolios span key growth areas like cloud security, critical infrastructure protection and AI-powered threat prevention.\n\nThus, for investors seeking tech exposure plus defensive qualities, the following cybersecurity stocks present an appealing option.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is one of the strongest cybersecurity stocks to buy right now. Its leading position in the $144 billion cybersecurity market along with a clear vision for growth makes FTNT a clear pick.\n\nSupporting FTNT is easy due to its impressive first-quarter 2024 financial results. Total revenue grew 7% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.35 billion, service revenue jumped an impressive 24%, and gross profit margins held strong at 75.5%. It owns a dominant 50% global market share in network security shipments. And, its industry-leading product innovation has over 900 U.S. patents.\n\nAdditionally, Fortinet is highly validated by industry analysts, winning leadership positions across eight Gartner Magic Quadrants. The Fortinet Security Fabric platform drives automated protection, detection and response for enterprises through AI-powered integration. Over 755,000 global customers already depend on Fortinet for security, including nearly three-quarters of the Fortune 100.\n\nAlso, the company was named Google Cloud\u2019s Technology Partner of the Year for Security in 2024. Fortinet\u2019s broad portfolio of integrated cybersecurity products positions them perfectly to capture share in the $222 billion total addressable market projected in 2028. Therefore, plan to buy this stock as it is poised for sustainable double-digit growth.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen looking for the best cybersecurity stocks to buy, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) deserves strong consideration. While not a pure-play cybersecurity company, Broadcom has established itself as a major player in enterprise security through strategic acquisitions.\n\nIn 2019, Broadcom acquired Symantec\u2019s enterprise security business for $10.7 billion. As a result, Broadcom instantly became one of the largest cybersecurity vendors globally. AVGO predicted around $2.3 billion in revenue from Symantec\u2019s enterprise business in the year after the acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently in 2023, Broadcom completed its $61 billion acquisition of VMware. The latter generated over $12 billion in TTM revenue as of Q3 of 2023, so this is a massive boost to Broadcom\u2019s software segment.\n\nIn Broadcom\u2019s latest earnings for Q1 of 2024, total revenue including VMware contributions jumped 34% YOY to almost $12 billion. Additionally, Broadcom expects about $50 billion in total consolidated revenue for full fiscal year 2024. For investors wanting cybersecurity exposure plus a highly diversified, profitable tech company, AVGO checks both boxes.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is the world\u2019s leading cybersecurity platform, protecting thousands of organizations globally from cyberthreats. Its best-in-class security solutions are strengthened by industry-leading threat intelligence and state-of-the-art automation.\n\nIn the most recent Q2 of 2024 earnings report, PANW showed strong growth with 19% YOY and total revenue expansion to $1.975 billion. Remaining performance obligations also rose an impressive 22% to $10.8 billion. Furthermore, non-GAAP EPS came in at a healthy $1.46. The company maintains a fortress balance sheet as well, with $6.991 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and investments.\n\nAdditionally, PANW continues to push new product innovations that leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to stay ahead of polymorphic threats aimed to accelerate and attack network infrastructure. Its new Precision AI-based solutions spans AI Attack Path, AI Security Posture Management and AI Runtime Security. These enable organizations to counter advanced threats and safely scale their own enterprise AI usage and integrations. Therefore, PANW offers investors exposure to secular tailwinds in the field, making it one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Cybersecurity remains an important and fast-growing industry. The global market for cybersecurity is forecast to grow by about 10% per year and, by 2028, reach nearly $275 billion. The market is being driven by all facets of society: individuals, businesses and governments, all of which are vulnerable to cyberattacks. And cyber incidents are becoming more and more costly every year.\n\nAccording to the FBI, cybercrime cost individual Americans more than $12 billion in 2023, and that cost is rising as both domestic and foreign criminals illegally access computers and networks, stealing money, data and other valuable information and assets. In all, cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy $8 trillion, equal to about $250,000 per second. No wonder cybersecurity companies are thriving.\n\nHere are the three most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy in May 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) will be looking to get out of the dog house with investors when it reports its next financial results on May 20. PANW stock fell 19% after the company\u2019s last print in which it lowered its full-year guidance for both revenue and billings. The lowered guidance stole the show and analysts and investors seemed not to notice that Palo Alto beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe company forecast full-year 2024 billings of $10.10 billion to $10.20 billion. This is down from previous guidance of $10.70 billion to $10.80 billion. Full-year revenues were also lowered to between $7.95 billion and $8 billion, which was lower than the previous guide for $8.15 billion to $8.20 billion. Management said during their earnings call that the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in AI products. Mentioning AI, however, did little to help the stock.\n\nYear-to-date, PANW stock is up only 5%. Investors may want to take a position before the next print leads to a rebound in share price.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm SentinelOne (NYSE:S) are down 16% this year despite the fact that the company delivered financial results that topped the consensus forecasts of Wall Street analysts. For the fourth quarter of 2023, SentinelOne reported an earnings per share (EPS) loss of 2 cents, which was much better than the loss of 4 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue for the quarter came in at $174.2 million, up 38% from a year earlier and ahead of Wall Street estimates of $169 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with Palo Alto, SentinelOne was undone by guidance that underwhelmed investors, sending its stock down 11% immediately after the print, where it has languished ever since. For all of this year, SentinelOne sees revenue of $812 million to $818 million. Management cited cost pressures from recent acquisitions as the reason for guidance that left Wall Street wanting more from the company. With a market capitalization of less than $7 billion, SentinelOne is one of the smaller cybersecurity firms.\n\nInvestors should treat the drop in S stock as a buying opportunity.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nA less obvious choice in the cybersecurity space is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). However, the company does protect businesses with advanced enterprise cybersecurity solutions that increasingly employ AI. And IBM stock looks certainly affordable, if not undervalued, trading at 19 times future earnings estimates and offering a quarterly dividend payment that yields 4%. IBM stock has also recently sold off following the company\u2019s latest earnings print, creating an opportunity for investors.\n\nIBM stock has also been affected by news that the technology giant is acquiring cloud software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP) for $6.4 billion. Analysts and investors appear to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the deal. For its part, IBM says the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings in the first full year after it closes. The company hopes to finalize the acquisition by year\u2019s end. IBM also continues to roll out AI products, noting that it has armed its 160,000 consultants with AI assistants to boost productivity. IBM stock is up 4% on the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Palo Alto metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Revenue- Product' to come in at $387.96 million.

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) to Report Q3 Earnings: What to Expect?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks PANW is scheduled to report its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 20.\n\nPalo Alto projects its fiscal third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.95-$1.98 billion, which suggests a year-over-year increase of 13-15%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97 billion, which implies growth of 14.3% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.24-$1.26 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW\u2019s non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $1.25 per share, which indicates an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $1.10.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 15.8%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is expected to boost its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to contribute to the quarterly performance.\n\nThe growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 2% and 4% ($2.3-$2.35 billion) in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMoreover, the increased use of the cloud and remote networks in a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks. This is leading to a rise in the demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW\u2019s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.\n\nPalo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which encompasses the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal third quarter as well.\n\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto\u2019s products by government organizations. The company\u2019s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.\n\nThis FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector\u2019s trust in PANW\u2019s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigher software mix, normalization in the supply-chain environment and efficiencies in customer support are anticipated to have aided the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, better cost management is expected to drive the third-quarter bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palo Alto this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that\u2019s not the case here.\n\nThough PANW currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, Zscaler ZS and Agilent Technologies A have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.38%. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 20.2%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s first-quarter earnings stands at $5.50 per share, which indicates a year-over-year improvement of 404.6%. It is estimated to report revenues of $24.19 billion, which suggests a jump of approximately 236.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nZscaler carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.39%. The company is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 30. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 28.2%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zscaler\u2019s third-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents per share, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 35.4%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $535.6 million, which calls for a year-over-year rise of 27.9%.\n\nAgilent Technologies is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 29. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.42% at present. Agilent Technologies\u2019 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.19 per share, which suggests a decrease of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $1.27. Agilent Technologies\u2019 quarterly revenues are estimated to decline 8% to $1.58 billion from $1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Presents An Opportunity",
        "content": "For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.\n\nSo if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow Fast Is Palo Alto Networks Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that Palo Alto Networks' EPS went from US$0.11 to US$7.05 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Palo Alto Networks shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 0.4% to 10% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Palo Alto Networks' future EPS 100% free.\n\nAre Palo Alto Networks Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nOwing to the size of Palo Alto Networks, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$923m. We note that this amounts to 0.9% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Palo Alto Networks but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.\n\nStory continues\n\nDoes Palo Alto Networks Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\nPalo Alto Networks' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Palo Alto Networks very closely. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified  2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  you should be aware of.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Palo Alto (PANW) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Palo Alto Networks (PANW) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nPalo Alto currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.62, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 42 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.62 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 42 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 28 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PANW Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PANW\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Palo Alto here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Palo Alto, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs PANW Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Palo Alto, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $5.50.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Palo Alto.

        "title": "Jobs Slump, Stocks Jump: 3 Surefire Picks to Capitalize on April\u2019s Weak NFP",
        "content": "The stock market reacted positively to weaker-than-expected labor market data in April\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, producing some stocks to buy. This counterintuitive response occurred because slower hiring leads to lower wage growth, which could help control inflation and benefit certain stocks. With inflation expected to slow down, analysts believe the Federal Reserve will be more inclined to ease in the coming months, inspiring investors to start considering which stocks to buy. There is currently over a 50% chance of an interest rate cut at the September meeting, making now a good time to invest in anticipation.\n\nTechnology stocks benefited most from expectations of lower rates, as higher-valuation stocks generally perform well in easing cycles. Investors looking to capitalize on upcoming Fed rate cuts may consider growth stocks. However, with the S&P 500\u2018s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio over 27x, there are many stocks to choose from. Easier access to funds from lower rates could boost virtually all sectors.\r\n\r\nLower borrowing costs may benefit some sectors and their stocks. Capital-intensive industries like mining, especially for \u201cnew energy\u201d metals such as copper, could gain. The housing sector may also benefit as lower interest rates reduce mortgage costs. The following are sure-fire stocks to buy that are well-positioned to ascend if April\u2019s weak jobs report leads to lower interest rates.\n\nAmerican Woodmark Corporation (AMWD)\n\nAmerican Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ:AMWD) is one of the stocks to buy for exposure to potential upside in the housing market. As the third-largest kitchen and bath furniture manufacturer, the company offers various designs through different price points and sells directly to major homebuilders through distributors. Lower interest rates are expected to spur house buying this year, which will likely increase demand for furnishings and help the company\u2019s sales return to growth. The firm has been cutting costs and streamlining over the last year, allowing it to increase its EBITDA despite slower sales. This positions American Woodmark well to maximize profits from any revenue rebound.\r\n\r\nFurniture companies typically do not command high valuations; American Woodmark is no exception. In fact, it represents a bargain compared to other companies. It trades at a P/E ratio of just 13.2x, below the S&P 500\u2019s ten-year mean. The company has built up significant cash reserves of $97.8 million, up from $45.8 million a year ago, giving it ample resources to pay dividends and increase share buybacks. American Woodmark is one of the stocks to buy, given its attractive valuation and positioning to benefit from an improving housing market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another stock to buy after experiencing a drop in February in the aftermath of unexpectedly cutting its guidance. However, the company still expects growth, and the trimmed sales guidance to +15-16% from 18-19% is not as significant as to warrant the 29% drop seen in its share price. This has now left the company with a lower P/E ratio of 46x compared to the sector\u2019s 43x, while other major companies are in the 3-digit P/E ratio range.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks is an attractive stock to buy, not just because it is relatively inexpensive compared to large technology firms. It is also a cash-generating machine, having increased its cash holdings over the last year by more than $650 million, ending with $1.78 billion in cash and equivalents. This large cash position provides a strong moat during market ups and downs and ample resources to sustain its share buyback program.\n\nBHP Group (BHP) Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nWhen interest rates start to come down, investors may also consider which commodity stocks to buy as commodity prices tend to thrive in a low interest rate environment. A good candidate is BHP Group (NYSE:BHP). The Australia-based mining company is one of the world\u2019s largest and most diversified commodities producers. BHP is looking to align its operations with the global energy transition, focusing on reducing high-carbon intensity projects and building out copper and nickel production. This could mean the company sees dual benefits from lower interest rates: Higher sales prices for its products and lower borrowing costs to finance new growth and acquisitions.\r\n\r\nBHP\u2019s stock price is down 16% this year, delivering a P/E ratio of 20x, which is below the 35x average of the sector. Unlike other companies, BHP doesn\u2019t stand out by having a lot of cash. In fact, it increased its debt over the last year, as most of its free cash went to acquiring OZ minerals. With the company looking to buy Anglo American (OTCMKTS:NGLOY) next, the lower cost of debt resulting from lower interest rates could mean BHP has more cash flow in the future to pay back dividends and buyback stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Profit From the Rise in Digital Dangers",
        "content": "While we celebrate grand innovations such as artificial intelligence, technology carries a dark side, which brings us to cybersecurity stocks to buy. As digitalization moves forward, so too will efforts to exploit vulnerabilities for personal or financial gain.\n\nIndeed, AI may be the source of the next big challenge for defending against cyberattacks. Yes, generative AI can be deployed productively. But because of this potentiality, it\u2019s also incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands. Cyber defenses may be getting smarter but so too are nefarious agents.\n\nThis war will never end. In that sense, these cybersecurity stocks to buy may enjoy an indefinitely long upside pathway.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKnown for its global defense solutions in the connectivity space, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) offers firewall appliances and software. One of its key products is Panorama, a security management solution for the global control of network security platforms as a virtual or a physical appliance. It also offers subscription services for threat prevention, malware and other digital attacks.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Palo Alto is a consistently strong performer. In fiscal 2023, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 15.5%. Of course, investors will be paying a premium for the privilege. Right now, shares trade at 13.9X trailing-year revenue. That\u2019s steep although it must be said that during the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2024, this multiple rose to 16.21X.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking at earnings per share of $5.51 on revenue of $7.99 billion. That\u2019s a major improvement over last year\u2019s results of earnings of $4.44 per share on sales of $6.89 billion. With more fiscal expansion projected in the following year, PANW makes a solid case for cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) provides cybersecurity and convergence of networking and security solutions worldwide. Per its public profile, Fortinet offers secure networking solutions focusing on the convergence of networking and security. As well, it provides network firewalls and distributed firewalls. Since the start of the year, FTNT only gained less than 1%, which may beg a contrarian take.\n\nOver the past four quarters ending in the first quarter, Fortinet\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came in at 14.38%. Its best performance during this period was in Q4, when it posted EPS of 51 cents against an expected print of 43 cents. To be fair, FTNT trades at a hot multiple of 8.43X trailing-year revenue. However, this metric hit 12.77X at the end of Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts are projecting EPS of $1.77 on revenue of $5.8 billion. That\u2019s a solid improvement over last year\u2019s results of earnings of $1.63 per share on sales of $5.3 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 calls for EPS of $1.96 and a top line of $6.54 billion. It\u2019s another good idea for cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nCyberArk Software (CYBR) Cyberark (CYBR) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nHailing from Israel, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) develops, markets, and sells software-based identity security solutions and services in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and other international markets. One of its top products is Privileged Access Manager, which offers risk-based credential security and access management. Since the start of the year, CYBR stock gained 8% of equity value.\n\nWhile CyberArk doesn\u2019t have the same name recognition as the other cybersecurity stocks to buy, it can more than hold its own. Indeed, over the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at nearly 112%. Its best performance during this period was in Q1 2024, when it delivered EPS of 75 cents against an expected 28 cents.\n\nTo be sure, CYBR stock is hot, carrying a trailing-year revenue multiple of 12.46X. Here\u2019s the thing. In fiscal 2024, EPS could reach $2.01 on revenue of $934.47 million. Last year, CyberArk posted earnings of $1.12 per share on revenue of $751.89 million. And in the following year, it could ring up $1.14 billion on the top line.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 14, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Boston Scientific Corporation BSX, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, American Electric Power Company, Inc. AEP and Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Boston Scientific, Arista and Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Boston Scientific Corporation, Arista Networks, Inc. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nBoston Scientific shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+37.3% vs. -1.7%). The company is witnessing strength across target markets, despite macroeconomic concerns, currency headwinds and related cost inflation.\r\n\r\nStrong worldwide demand for its Electrophysiology and Structural Heart lines, traction in Europe for its the next generation WATCHMAN FLX, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions are important drivers. The Pain and Brain franchisees are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on strong execution of core growth strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Electrophysiology arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE. The 2024 guidance indicating strong growth over 2023 builds confidence in the stock. On the flip side, mounting costs due to worldwide geopolitical issues are major concerns. FX headwinds continue to largely offset the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Boston Scientific here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Arista Networks have outperformed the Zacks Communication - Components industry over the past six months (+45.9% vs. +37.2%). The company reported healthy first-quarter results with solid top and bottom-line growth year over year, driven by robust demand trends. Easing supply chain woes and steady customer additions backed by the company\u2019s best-in-class portfolio strength ensured top-line expansion, while steady margin improvement contributed to earnings growth.\r\n\r\nBoth the bottom and the top lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Arista is likely to benefit from a software-driven, data-centric approach that helps customers build their cloud architecture and enhance the cloud experience. It expects a healthy improvement in gross margin, owing to the optimization of manufacturing output.\r\n\r\nHowever, fierce competition in cloud networking solutions market is worrisome. Cautious spending behavior, primarily from cloud titan customers, is another concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Arista Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+54.2% vs. +48.0%). The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Rises As Market Takes a Dip: Key Facts",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) closed the most recent trading day at $302.25, moving +1.61% from the previous trading session. The stock outpaced the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.02%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.21%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.29%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the security software maker had gained 6.59% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.39% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.29% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Palo Alto Networks in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on May 20, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.25, indicating a 13.64% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.97 billion, up 14.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $5.50 per share and a revenue of $7.98 billion, signifying shifts of +23.87% and +15.72%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Palo Alto Networks. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.25% higher within the past month. Right now, Palo Alto Networks possesses a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nIn the context of valuation, Palo Alto Networks is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 54.13. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.61, so one might conclude that Palo Alto Networks is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that PANW currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.04. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Internet - Software industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.62 as of yesterday's close.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 77, putting it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Earnings Exodus: 3 Stocks to Ditch Before Q1 Reports Wreak Havoc",
        "content": "Earnings season is drawing to a close, with more than 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 index having reported their first-quarter financial results. However, some big names still need to issue their Q1 prints. For a few of these companies, the stakes are high. Analysts and investors will be scrutinizing the data for signs of improvement after past poor performance. That means there may be some stocks to sell before earnings reports come out.\n\nManagement at these troubled companies will be in the spotlight and looking to redeem themselves with their Q1 numbers. Investors have shown that they are not in a forgiving mood when it comes to even the slightest earnings misstep by a company. Stocks are falling 15% or more in a day on missed profit and revenue figures, as well as weak guidance. Not every company will meet the expectations that have been set for them.\n\nHere are three companies that will release their Q1 results within the next week, but that investors might want to consider selling now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHome Depot (HD) a Home Depot store is seen from the outside\n\nSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are a couple of reasons to sell Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stock before the company reports its Q1 earnings on May 14. With its last print, Home Depot lowered its guidance, saying it expects sales to grow 1% this year. That was about half the growth forecast on Wall Street. Executives warned that they continue to see a pullback in consumer spending on big-ticket items due to inflation and high interest rates.\n\nIn addition to the soft outlook, Home Depot is undertaking the biggest purchase in its history, paying $18.25 billion for privately held SRS Distribution as it bets its future on sales to professional contractors rather than homeowners. Sales to contractors are viewed as more stable than sales to homeowners, whose spending can fluctuate with the economy and housing market.\n\nWhile management says the SRS Distribution purchase will increases its total addressable market by $50 billion, the deal is not without risk. It still needs regulatory approval. HD stock is flat on the year, down 1% since January. Investors trying to hedge their bets should consider HD one of the stocks to sell before earnings are published.\n\nCanada Goose (GOOS) canada goose (goos) logo on the sleeve of a jacket\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThings are not going well at Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) heading into its Q1 print on May 16. The company that specializes in winter parkas has reported a string of financial results that missed analyst expectations, sending its stock lower. In the last 12 months, GOOS stock has declined 46%, including a 3% decline so far in 2024. At the end of March, Canada Goose announced that it is cutting 17% of its global workforce.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe job cuts will impact employees at the company\u2019s corporate headquarters, though it\u2019s not clear exactly how many people will be let go. Canada Goose had 915 employees at the end of last year, according to securities filings. The headcount reduction comes as consumers pullback on discretionary spending amid high inflation and as global warming lessens the impact of winter.\n\nIn a press release, Canada Goose said the job cuts will help it achieve cost savings and become more efficient. In the past five years, GOOS stock has declined 77%. It\u2019s unlikely it will see a dramatic turnaround, so GOOS looks like one of the stocks to sell before earnings come out later this week.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nManagement at Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) needs to pull a rabbit out of their hat when the company reports its Q1 results on May 20. The cybersecurity firm\u2019s last earnings report was a disaster, sending PANW stock down 19% in one day. It was the stock\u2019s worst performance ever. So far this year, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 share price has increased less than 5%.\n\nThe company did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its financial results. But problems came when management lowered their full-year guidance. The company said it expects full-year billings of $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion. That was down from previous guidance of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. Palo Alto Networks also expects full-year revenue between $7.95 billion and $8 billion, lower than a previous guide of $8.15 billion to $8.20 billion.\n\nManagement said the lowered guidance was due to a shift in strategy and wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. Palo Alto Networks is moving quickly to adopt AI technologies and gain market share in the fast-growing segment. None of this information sat well with investors. The upcoming Q1 print needs to redeem PANW stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Pain and Brain franchisees are expected to gain solid traction in 2024 banking on strong execution of core growth strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Electrophysiology arm received a strong boost on the FDA approval for FARAPULSE. The 2024 guidance indicating strong growth over 2023 builds confidence in the stock. On the flip side, mounting costs due to worldwide geopolitical issues are major concerns. FX headwinds continue to largely offset the company\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Boston Scientific here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Arista Networks have outperformed the Zacks Communication - Components industry over the past six months (+45.9% vs. +37.2%). The company reported healthy first-quarter results with solid top and bottom-line growth year over year, driven by robust demand trends. Easing supply chain woes and steady customer additions backed by the company\u2019s best-in-class portfolio strength ensured top-line expansion, while steady margin improvement contributed to earnings growth.\r\n\r\nBoth the bottom and the top lines beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Arista is likely to benefit from a software-driven, data-centric approach that helps customers build their cloud architecture and enhance the cloud experience. It expects a healthy improvement in gross margin, owing to the optimization of manufacturing output.\r\n\r\nHowever, fierce competition in cloud networking solutions market is worrisome. Cautious spending behavior, primarily from cloud titan customers, is another concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Arista Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+54.2% vs. +48.0%). The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HCA Healthcare, Inc.

        "title": "We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW)",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ:PANW) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Palo Alto Networks is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.074 = US$778m \u00f7 (US$18b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nThus, Palo Alto Networks has an ROCE of 7.4%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 7.2%, it's still a low return by itself.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Palo Alto Networks compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Palo Alto Networks .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Palo Alto Networks' ROCE Trend?\n\nThe fact that Palo Alto Networks is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 7.4% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 174% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nAnother thing to note, Palo Alto Networks has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 42%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Palo Alto Networks' ROCE\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Palo Alto Networks has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a final note, we found 2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "title": "Hidden Tech Titans: 3 Stocks Ready to Rocket Past Market Expectations by 2027",
        "content": "Three exceptional IT businesses offer investors attractive opportunities due to their strategic orientation and exceptional performance with solid fundamentals. With a\u00a0substantial\u00a0increase in revenue, the first one has accelerated. This outstanding result highlights the company\u2019s skill at gaining market share and profitably monetizing its products, indicating a promising future growth trajectory.\n\nMeanwhile, the second one has seen a considerable boost in revenue in the semiconductor business. This lead has\u00a0been driven\u00a0by its diverse product portfolio. It serves several semiconductor industry areas and has established the firm as a\u00a0major\u00a0player with excellent growth prospects.\n\nFinally, the third has demonstrated remarkable financial strength and has a gross profit fueled by its\u00a0main\u00a0business. Furthermore, the company\u2019s development potential in the rapidly developing cryptocurrency environment has\u00a0been reinforced\u00a0by its strategic emphasis on Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and cryptocurrencies.\u00a0This\u00a0is supported by effective resource allocation and a dedication to innovation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOverall, these are not random possibilities; they result from each company\u2019s strategic goals, market flexibility and creative problem-solving.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the second quarter, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) demonstrated a robust sales growth of 19% year-over-year (YoY), reaching $2 billion. This steady growth, from $1.7 billion in total sales for Q2 2023, is a testament to Palo Alto\u2019s ability to consistently capture market share and effectively monetize its offerings, reflecting solid top-line growth.\n\nMoreover, the\u00a0full\u00a0value growth of Palo Alto\u2019s future revenue is reflected in the Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) growth, which\u00a0has increased by 22% YoY to $10.8 billion. Strong demand for Palo Alto\u2019s products indicates this RPO boost and a robust pipeline of potential future income streams. Hence, the company can win long-term client commitments and contracts.\n\nFinally, the income earned from client invoices was reflected in the\u00a016% growth in billings YoY. Since the spike in billings is marginally slower than the revenue growth, there may be variations in billing cycles or revenue recognition techniques. Despite the stable bill increase, Palo Alto\u2019s capacity to propel sales momentum\u00a0is confirmed, staying in line with the trend of total top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nACM Research\u2018s (NASDAQ:ACMR) fourth quarter sales were $170 million, a considerable 57% increase YoY. In comparison, the company\u2019s sales for 2023 were $558 million, signaling a solid 43% YoY increase.\n\nAdditionally, one of ACM Research\u2019s main advantages that propel its quick growth is its stable top-line growth.\u00a0Indeed, strong market demand for the company\u2019s offerings indicates this increase.\u00a0This\u00a0also reflects the company\u2019s successful market placement and happy customers. Thus, the capacity to steadily raise income indicates the market relevance and future growth prospects of ACM Research.\n\nIn 2023, sales of semi-critical cleaning products, Tahoe and single wafer cleaning climbed by 48%, accounting for 72% of revenue. There was a 33% YoY growth in sales from electrochemical plating (ECP) furnaces and other technologies, accounting for about 19% of the overall top line.\n\nFinally, except\u00a0for ECP\u00a0services and parts, revenue from advanced packaging increased by\u00a031.5% YoY in 2023 to make up 9% of overall revenue. ACM Research has a diverse product line. It targets several semiconductor industry areas. Therefore, the solid revenue increase observed in all product categories suggests that ACM Research\u2019s solutions are in high demand.\n\nBlock (SQ) The logo for Block (SQ) is shown on a phone screen with the company's old name and logo, Square, visible behind the phone.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock\u2018s (NYSE:SQ) potential for considerable expansion derives from its solid performance and stable growth across\u00a0key\u00a0measures. There was an adjusted EBITDA of $705 million in Q1 2024, nearly 3x from Q1 2023. Similarly, there was a gross profit of $2.09 billion, up 22% YoY. Comparably, adjusted operating income increased seven times from the previous year to $364 million.\n\nMoreover, Cash App\u2019s gross profit increased by 25% to $1.26 billion in segments, while Square\u2019s gross profit increased by\u00a019% to $820 million.\u00a0Indeed, the company can produce considerable profits and revenues, as indicated by this expansion.\u00a0This\u00a0is fueled\u00a0by the success of its\u00a0main\u00a0companies, Cash App and Square.\n\nFurther, one of the main factors boosting Block\u2019s growth potential is its strategic concentration on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

        "content": "The conversation around overpaid CEOs is a subject near and dear to my heart.\n\nNothing is more annoying than reading about David Zaslav\u2019s ongoing personal enrichment while Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) shareholders see the value of their investment continue to shrink. Most recently, I discussed Zaslav\u2019s outrageous compensation at the end of April.\n\nIf a CEO needs to be fired, he is it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnyway, Fortune published an article around the same time that discussed Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $24.4 million in \u201cother compensation\u201d in 2024.\n\nAlthough Zuckerberg\u2019s only other compensation is a token $1 annual salary, the world\u2019s fourth-wealthiest person ($166 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index) should be able to afford his own personal security. Perhaps it\u2019s an insurance thing that requires the company to cover it. Who knows?\n\nWho else has significant \u201cother compensation?\u201d\n\nHere are three more overpaid CEOs other than Zaslav.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google pay logo\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s total compensation in 2023 was considerably less than the $226 million he received a year earlier. However, in the past three fiscal years, Pichai\u2019s \u201cother compensation\u201d totaled $17.1 million, with only $6.8 million for personal security in 2023.\n\nSo what was the other $10.3 million for? According to its proxy, it included up to $11,250 for a 401(k) or Roth company match and personal use of a company car and aircraft. That\u2019s a lot of flights.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t get any stock awards in 2023, he realized $155.4 million from stock that vested in the past year, providing the CEO with plenty of cash to pay for these flights.\n\nHowever, with GOOGL stock up 57% over the past year and the company announcing a $0.20 quarterly dividend starting in June, shareholders are probably willing to cut him some slack.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) CEO Nikesha Arora received a total compensation of $151.4 million in fiscal 2023 (July year-end). Of that, $145.4 million was for stock awards.\n\nOver the past three fiscal years, the CEO\u2019s total \u201cother compensation\u201d was $6.5 million. Payments included life insurance and disability insurance premiums, $30,000 for a regulatory filing for ownership of the tech company\u2019s stock, personal security, personal use of an aircraft, and the payment of $286,043 to cover the taxes for the personal use of the aircraft.\n\nThat\u2019s a decent chunk of money shareholders are covering. However, compared to the $162 million realized in fiscal 2023 for option exercises and stock vested during the year, on top of the $145.4 million in stock awards, the CEO shouldn\u2019t have too many problems paying for family vacations using the company jet.\n\nStory continues\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget, Arora owns 3.9 million shares of Palo Alto stock worth $1.2 billion. That\u2019s a lot for a hired gun and not a founder.\n\nHowever, with its stock more than quadrupling since Arora became CEO in June 2018, I\u2019m sure shareholders will let it slide.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) CEO and co-founder Jason Robins generated total compensation of $20.8 million, $47.5 million, and $14.0 million in the past three years. That\u2019s not nearly as much as the Alphabet and Palo Alto CEOs.\n\nIn the past three years, Robins\u2019 \u201cother compensation\u201d totaled $5.6 million. According to its summary compensation table, it was for security ($1.1 million), air travel costs ($1.1 million), a matching 401(k) contribution ($9,900), financial planning services ($15,925), the purchase of tickets, travel and accommodations to Company-sponsored events during the year ($61,095), and tax reimbursements ($353,335).\n\nConversely, Robins is only paid $1 a year for salary. That makes sense, given he owns 13.67 million Class A shares and 393.01 million Class B valued at $17.6 billion. He can afford to go without.\n\nIn 2023, Robins generated $86.9 million from options exercises and stock vesting, so there\u2019s not going to be a tag day for the CEO.\n\nI will say this about Robins and the other two CEOs: They might be overpaid, but at least their company\u2019s shares have performed reasonably well in recent years.\n\nAs long as shareholders don\u2019t protest, companies will continue to overpay their CEOs, believing they must pay top dollar for top talent.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Within the fast-changing, technology-driven market landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is a disruptive force redefining industries worldwide. Three significant firms have emerged as front-runners throughout this transition, and by 2027, they should control most of the AI stock market. Each organization exhibits unique strengths and plans, from cybersecurity breakthroughs and cloud services to robotics technology backed by AI.\n\nTo begin with, the first one has shown impressive revenue development, using robotic technology powered by AI to transform the supply chain industry. The second one, on the other hand, showcases its aptitude for upselling and retaining customers. Meanwhile, it is utilizing platform-driven tactics and AI-powered cybersecurity solutions. Meanwhile, the third company has seen a remarkable rise in cloud revenue and cutting-edge AI blueprint tools.\u00a0This\u00a0solidifies its standing as a pioneer in advancing digital transformation for its customers.\n\nOverall, the growth paths of these stocks demonstrate the growing integration of AI technology across several industries.\u00a0This\u00a0ranges from expedited deployment progress to improved consumer interaction and operational efficiencies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSymbotic\u00a0(SYM) Symbotic (SYM) Short-Squeeze Stocks\n\nWith Q2 2024\u00a0revenue of $424 million, Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) showed strong revenue growth, up 59% year-over-year (YoY) ($267 million in fiscal 2023). The business projects sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to be between $450 million and $470 million, indicating that it expects revenue growth to continue. As a result, Symbotic has the fundamental capacity to gain market share and profit from the rising demand for its AI-enabled robotics technology in the supply chain industry.\n\nDuring Q2, Symbotic made headway on expediting system deployments, starting three new ones and finishing three operational ones. Revenue growth directly results from the company\u2019s ability to accelerate deployment progress since quicker deployments free up resources to meet future client demand. Thanks to the number of finished systems, Symbiotics combined recurring revenue streams increased significantly, growing by\u00a0145% YoY and 85% sequentially.\n\nFinally, the\u00a0substantial\u00a0leverage in Symbotic\u2019s business model is reflected in the contribution of all recurring revenue sources to positive adjusted gross profit.\u00a0Hence, this\u00a0signifies the company\u2019s capacity to profit from several active sites that produce recurring income.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPalo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) successfully grows its clientele and their expenditures. Important indicators of the company\u2019s capacity to foster client loyalty and upsell further offerings include the 36% YoY spending increase by the top 10 clients and the growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) from SASE clients. The company\u2019s excellent client adoption trends support its platformization and consolidation strategy.\n\nMoreover,\u00a079% of Global 2000 clients have used at least two Palo Alto platforms for transactions, and 57% have used all three. Customers across several platforms have far greater customer lifetime values, reflecting the effectiveness of Palo Alto\u2019s platform-driven strategy.\n\nFurther, Palo Alto positions itself as the customer\u2019s first choice by highlighting its leadership in several security categories and platforms. The company\u2019s credibility and market leadership are reflected in recognition from industry experts. For instance, the company\u00a0leads the Gartner Endpoint Protection Magic Quadrant.\n\nFinally, the business emphasizes how AI may provide new development prospects in cybersecurity. Palo Alto positioned itself at the forefront of technical innovation in the industry. Therefore, it aims to roll out AI-based services and address new security problems connected to AI installations.\n\nPega (PEGA)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPega\u2019s (NASDAQ:PEGA) cloud gross margin jumped to 77%, up 5% YoY.\u00a0Pega Cloud\u2019s Q1 sales of $131 million increased by 21% YoY. Kubernetes, enhanced scaling and better cloud capacity management facilitated the growth in gross margin.\n\nAdditionally, the\u00a0enhancement in Pega Cloud\u2019s gross margin may\u00a0be attributed\u00a0to the company\u2019s cloud infrastructure\u2019s cost management strategies, economies of scale and operational efficiency.\u00a0Higher gross margins benefit from increased profitability and the opportunity to fund more development and innovation projects.\u00a0This\u00a0also helps Pega maintain its competitive edge in the cloud services industry.\n\nIn Q1, Pega released the GenAI Blueprint, quickly gaining popularity and utilization. Since its introduction, hundreds of clients and partners have created thousands of blueprints. Hence, the adoption and availability of the GenAI Blueprint support digital transformation programs and client engagement.\n\nLastly, the methodical introduction and uptake of Pega GenAI Blueprint showcase Pega\u2019s innovation leadership and capacity to meet client demands successfully. The tool\u2019s value proposition and capacity to propel digital transformation reflects its appeal among partners and clients. To sum up, the GenAI Blueprint\u2019s contribution to client engagement supports Pega\u2019s strong growth trajectory.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The semiconductor market has reached a tipping point, which is why savvy investors should be looking for semiconductor stocks to sell at the moment. Semiconductor stocks have been on a stellar run over the past 2 years, thanks to the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G and data centers. However, the outlook of the industry does not look as promising going forward.\n\nDespite reaching a record $595.7 billion in revenue in 2022, the semiconductor market experienced declines across all four quarters of 2023. Moreover, due to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, some U.S. companies are at high risk of disruption due to their geographic concentration in China.\n\nFurthermore, recent macroeconomic concerns, including inflation, high interest rates, and slowing global demand, have cast a shadow over the semiconductor sector. The Federal Reserve\u2019s tightening policy and emerging economic headwinds could make the upcoming months challenging for chip stocks. Here are three semiconductor stocks to consider selling this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a diversified portfolio that spans both semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. However, the shifting market dynamics and geopolitical tensions pose headwinds for the company.\n\nChina accounts for a significant portion of Broadcom\u2019s revenue. The country was responsible for around $11.53 billion of revenue in 2023, making it AVGO\u2019s largest geographic market. With the U.S.-China trade tensions heating up, Broadcom is exposed to regulatory risks. Any restrictions on semiconductor sales could severely impact the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom\u2019s legacy software businesses, CA Technologies and Symantec, face headwinds. CA Technologies is entrenched in the declining mainframe market, while Symantec\u2019s traditional antivirus solutions are being eclipsed by cloud-native competitors like CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW).\n\nThe company\u2019s valuation multiples far exceed the semiconductor industry average. Much of Broadcom\u2019s valuation is driven by expectations around its AI business. If AI-driven growth slows down, it can cause a significant downside in the stock price.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon Valley\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is known for its historical dominance in the CPU market. However, in recent years, the company has faced significant challenges, leading to a sharp decline in its stock price. Although the company posted revenues and earnings per share above analyst expectations, the company\u2019s weak guidance for the upcoming quarter sent Intel shares tumbling. The company\u2019s stock has fallen 35% since the start of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel Foundry has reported a deal pipeline exceeding $15 billion. However, profitability remains a distant goal for the company. Intel expects Intel Foundry to remain unprofitable until at least the midpoint of this decade. In addition, Intel faces competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which claims its N3P process will outperform Intel\u2019s 18A node.\n\nChina represents Intel\u2019s largest market, accounting for 27% of the company\u2019s total revenues. However, recent regulatory changes have highlighted Intel\u2019s heightened exposure to geopolitical risks. The Chinese government has urged state-backed organizations to reduce their reliance on foreign chips. This will have a direct impact on Intel\u2019s market share.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn recent years, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a serious contender in the semiconductor industry. However, it faces stiff competition from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which continues to dominate this space. Despite moderately positive earnings surprises, AMD\u2019s stock has faced selling pressure of late. The stock has fallen 23% since the start of March this year.\n\nNvidia recently announced its next-generation Blackwell GPUs, coupled with advanced AI software offerings. This could pose a significant threat to AMD\u2019s market share. Although AMD\u2019s MI300 AI accelerator has made impressive gains, analysts remain cautious about its ability to compete effectively with Nvidia\u2019s upcoming products.\n\nWhile AMD has raised its FY2024 data center GPU revenue guidance from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, this pales in comparison to Nvidia\u2019s $47.5 billion in data center revenues in FY2024.\n\nWith the stock currently trading at a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation, investors should carefully assess the risk/reward of having money invested in AMD stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Think About Buying Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) Now?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth of 15% on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine Palo Alto Networks\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Still Cheap?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Palo Alto Networks is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $399.23, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Palo Alto Networks\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from Palo Alto Networks? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Palo Alto Networks, at least in the near future.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although PANW is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to PANW, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on PANW for some time, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've found that Palo Alto Networks has 2 warning signs (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Palo Alto Networks, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.25% upward. Palo Alto Networks currently has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Palo Alto Networks is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 53.9. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 30.53 for its industry.\n\nOne should further note that PANW currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.03. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.55 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 69, finds itself in the top 28% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this security software maker have returned +10.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Palo Alto belongs, has lost 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nPalo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +23.9%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Palo Alto.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PANW _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8 billion and $9.17 billion estimates indicate +16.1% and +14.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.22%. The EPS surprise was +12.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Best-Performing Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "While you might not agree with the political stuff, Nancy Pelosi stocks have represented a tremendously popular topic. You might say there\u2019s bipartisan support for tracking the securities that the former House Speaker has acquired.\n\nInvestors have plenty of reasons to consider trading alongside the legislator. First, Pelosi is smart. Again, you can disagree with her politics. However, you don\u2019t rise to power (and stay there) without commanding tremendous intellect. Second, she knows how things work (or don\u2019t work). If Pelosi feels strongly about a company, you should at least pay attention.\n\nGranted, no one has a 100% success rate. Still, these Nancy Pelosi stocks have proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the more recent acquisitions among Nancy Pelosi stocks, the former House Speaker acquired shares of cybersecurity specialist Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) in February of this year. Technically speaking, it\u2019s not the outright best-performing idea this year. Since the beginning of January, PANW has moved up a bit over 2%. However, the potential is robust.\n\nPer information provided by Forbes, a data breach costs on average about $4.45 million. It notes that in 2022, business email accounts that suffered data compromises incurred $2.7 billion in losses. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the global cybersecurity industry should reach a valuation of $208.8 billion by the end of the year.\n\nAs for Palo Alto Networks, experts project that it will post $7.98 billion in revenue by year\u2019s end. If so, that would be up 15.8% from last year\u2019s haul of $6.89 billion. In fiscal 2025, sales could rise to $9.13 billion.\n\nPANW isn\u2019t the best-performing idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks. However, it offers significant long-term upside potential.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nA longtime supporter of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pelosi last acquired shares of the technology giant in June of last year. It\u2019s been an amazing investment. Sure, MSFT is only up 7% after suffering a recent correction due to broader tech sector momentum loss. However, in the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s up more than 30%. That\u2019s quite a turnaround from the days when MSFT was just a boring element in the landscape.\n\nMuch of the enthusiasm currently centers on the company\u2019s investments in artificial intelligence. With more companies exploring the capabilities of generative AI, Microsoft positioned itself early. Bloomberg notes that the sector itself could be worth $1.3 trillion by 2032. That\u2019s one big reason why MSFT ranks among the top Nancy Pelosi stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts anticipate a strong year in fiscal 2024, forecasting earnings per share to hit $11.79. That\u2019s well above last year\u2019s print of $9.81. On the top line, sales could fly up to $244.93 billion or a 15.6% increase from 2023\u2019s haul of $211.91 billion. Moreover, the most optimistic revenue target calls for a print of $248.47 billion.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nUndoubtedly one of the favorite (if not the favorite) ideas among Nancy Pelosi stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been kicking the bears\u2019 hindquarters since the closing months of 2022. The former House Speaker last acquired NVDA in November last year. It\u2019s been a lucrative decision. Over the past six months (going back to Nov. 2), NVDA gained over 97% of its equity value.\n\nThat\u2019s really nothing compared to the past 52-week performance, when NVDA ripped out a 204% return. Nvidia of course is best known for its graphics processing units. Initially, these GPUs focused on gaming applications. Increasingly, though, their processing capabilities served myriad other functions, such as datacenters and of course AI. With more enterprises focused on digital intelligence, Nvidia commands an enviable advantage in the space.\n\nAdmittedly, there is a risk regarding AI being overhyped. If so, a steeper correction could materialize than the one we\u2019ve seen. Still, analysts don\u2019t seem worried one bit. For the current fiscal year, they\u2019re targeting revenue of $111.92 billion, up 83.7% from last year\u2019s tally of $60.92 billion.\n\nMust be grand to live a life of public service.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy as Fed Takes a More Dovish Tone",
        "content": "The Federal Reserve sparked a rally in equities by taking a more dovish tone after its May meeting. Fed chair Jerome Powell dampened concerns that interest rates will go higher and reiterated the Fed\u2019s belief that rates are headed lower. At some point. Maybe. Who knows? The takeaway for investors is that as they consider stocks to buy as the Fed turns dovish, a range of outcomes is still possible.\n\nOne place to look is a company\u2019s free cash flow (FCF). Free cash flow is the cash that a company has left over in its operating cash flow after it deducts capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Companies can use this \u201cfree\u201d cash for many purposes including paying dividends, buying back shares, making acquisitions, paying down debt or just letting it settle on the balance sheet.\n\nWhen interest rates were at or near zero, money and debt were free. That meant investors were less concerned about investing in unprofitable companies. But even if interest rates move lower, the days of near-zero interest are unlikely to come back anytime soon.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat means one place to look for stocks to buy as the Fed turns dovish is companies that won\u2019t have worries about cash. Here are three stocks to consider.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is one of the leading cybersecurity companies. The company recently adopted a platformization strategy in which it will allow existing customers free access to certain elements of its platform with the expectation of building annual recurring revenue (ARR) as the company builds market share.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold strategy that may affect growth in the short term, which is a reason why\u00a0PANW stock is down 14.1% in the three months ending May 3, 2024.\u00a0But the need for cybersecurity will make cybersecurity a must-have expense for Palo Alto\u2019s growing customer base.\n\nAnd Palo Alto is well capitalized to weather any hiccups. In the company\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings report delivered in February 2024, the company reported $655 million in free cash flow. It also expects full-year free cash flow yield to come in between 38% and 39%. A company\u2019s free cash flow yield is divides the last 12 months of its free cash flow by the market value of the stock.\n\nIn November 2023, Palo Alto announced board approval to repurchase $316.7 million of its stock.. This is an addition to Palo Alto\u2019s existing $3.3 billion buyback program which was authorized in 2019. Palo Alto Networks is not currently a dividend payer.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the few Magnificent 7 stocks that\u2019s continuing to grow in 2024. MSFT stock is up more than 33% in the last 12 months, which outpaces the S&P 500. The company\u2019s product offerings touch every category in the technology sector that is expected to grow in the next 20 years.\n\nThe company\u2019s expansive reach includes cloud computing and artificial intelligence. In its most third quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024, Microsoft generated $21 billion in free cash flow which was up 18% due to its spending in the cloud and AI.\n\nThe tech giant continues to buyback shares as part of a $60 billion buyback plan authorized by the company\u2019s board in 2021. And Microsoft is also nearing dividend aristocrat status. The company has increased its dividend for 22 consecutive years.\n\nAt a time when growth will get tougher to come by, Microsoft is a company that investors can continue to generate cash and use it to grow the business while still rewarding shareholders.\n\nAltria (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nLess risk-tolerant investors may want to consider a stock like Altria (NYSE:MO). You may know it as one of the leading manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless products. The company has solid, but not spectacular growth. But what it lacks in growth, it makes up for in cash.\n\nFor the full year 2023, Altria generated $9.09 billion in free cash flow. And in the first quarter of 2024, the company generated over $2.8 billion in FCF.\n\nOver the last five years, Altria has returned $37.5 billion in cash to shareholders. For example, the company completed its previously authorized $1 billion share buyback program by paying off 22.7 million shares.\n\nHowever, one of the more compelling ways Altria uses its free cash flow is its high-yield dividend. As of May 3, 2024, the company\u2019s dividend yield was 8.99%. Altria is also a dividend king that has raised its dividend for 55 consecutive years. The company recently announced a progressive dividend goal. In line with that, the company raised its dividend per share by 4.3%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "As the investing options continue to change, the market is paying close attention to the steady growth potential of AI stocks. Three exceptional businesses emerge as bright spots amid market volatility, each offering special prospects.\n\nThe allure of AI stocks is their ability to overcome challenges and seize opportunities and their strategic positioning for long-term success in volatile market conditions. The first company, for instance, has demonstrated resilience in the face of client migrations, leading to solid revenue growth from diverse sources and strategic collaborations. The second company\u2019s significant increase in spending from loyal clients underscores its strong customer loyalty and potential for substantial upselling, paving the way for long-term revenue growth.\n\nIn the meantime, the third company focuses on growing its market share and boosting income streams. This demonstrates its lead in automotive integration and smart acquisitions in the restaurant AI sector. Finally, these businesses\u2019 proactive approaches to diversification and growth \u2014 two crucial tactics that support their resilience and adaptability \u2014 are what binds them together.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInnodata (INOD) Financial technology concept with 3d rendering robot analyze stock market big data. AI tech stock predictions. top-rated ai stocks\n\nSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nA sizable amount of Innodata\u2019s (NASDAQ:INOD) income in 2022 ($8.5 million) came from a\u00a0major\u00a0social media business. However, Innodata was able to lessen the impact of losing this client by increasing its revenue streams from other sources.\n\nMoreover, the\u00a0company is effective in maintaining revenue stability and retaining customers.\u00a0This\u00a0is demonstrated in its ability to strike multi-year agreements with important clients, like the three-year contract it signed in late Q4 2023. Innodata collaborates with well-known tech companies, including three of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies.\u00a0This\u00a0showcases Innodata\u2019s capacity to break into important areas, such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), and use strategic alliances to boost revenue.\n\nFurthermore, Innodata demonstrated strong revenue growth, especially in 2023\u2019s Q4. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled\u00a0$26.1 million, a significant 35% increase over the previous year and 18% sequentially. Notably, the business raised $24.5 million over its projected guidance by 6.5%, demonstrating a high demand for its generative AI services.\n\nIn summary, the big social media company\u2019s decision to terminate services presented difficulties, yet revenue growth was remarkable. Lastly, the revenue increase for 2023 was 10% annually, indicating a stable performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe top 10 highest-spending Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) clients saw a 36% rise in expenditures.\u00a0This\u00a0suggests that Palo Alto Networks has a devoted customer base and can effectively promote upsells and cross-sells to its clientele. Increased spending and high customer retention are indicators of the value that clients place on the company\u2019s goods and services.\u00a0This\u00a0supports long-term expansion and recurrent income streams.\n\nThe Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) business also saw a\u00a050% annual recurring revenue (ARR) gain for the sixth consecutive quarter in Q2. Strong demand for Palo Alto Networks\u2019 platform-based solutions is reflected in the steadily increasing ARR, especially in the quickly developing SASE market. Growth in ARR reflects both the stickiness of the company\u2019s products and the development of its subscription-based revenue model.\n\nLastly, the number of customers who own two or more Prisma Cloud modules has increased by around 30%. Meanwhile, the number of those who own three or more modules increased by\u00a0about 60%. The growing number of Prisma Cloud modules being adopted shows how much emphasis users place on unifying their security solutions on a single platform. Hence, adopting many modules increases the addressable market, increases client stickiness, and generates more income through upselling.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Palo Alto Networks fair value estimate is US$400 Palo Alto Networks is estimated to be 26% undervalued based on current share price of US$295 Analyst price target for PANW is US$336 which is 16% below our fair value estimate\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Method\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$3.07b US$3.49b US$4.09b US$4.80b US$5.64b US$6.27b US$6.80b US$7.26b US$7.65b US$7.99b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x27 Analyst x25 Analyst x18 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 11.11% Est @ 8.49% Est @ 6.66% Est @ 5.38% Est @ 4.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.0%  US$2.9k US$3.1k US$3.3k US$3.7k US$4.0k US$4.2k US$4.2k US$4.2k US$4.2k US$4.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.0%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$8.0b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.0%\u2013 2.4%) = US$179b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$179b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.0%)10= US$91b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$129b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$295, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Palo Alto Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.995. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "content": "The share price of Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) reached $380 earlier this year but currently sits at $293 as of this writing. The company continues to see strong demand for its cybersecurity solutions, and one analyst believes it's worth buying on the dip.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala is maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the shares with a $360 price target -- 23% upside from the current share price.\n\nWhy the stock is down\n\nPalo Alto's revenue grew 19% year over year in the January-ending quarter, with remaining performance obligations up 22%. But the solid top-line growth was overshadowed by management's guidance that calls for revenue to grow between 13% and 15% in fiscal Q3.\n\nImportantly, this guidance doesn't reflect weak demand. Palo Alto's top 10 highest-spending customers grew their spend by 36% last quarter, and Morgan Stanley's research indicates that Palo Alto is competitively positioned to continue winning large deals.\n\nAnd Palo Alto still has an enormous opportunity win more spending with existing customers. Management is doubling down on accelerating customers' shift from legacy security providers its three platforms, which include cloud security, security automation and operations, and network security. When customers adopt all three platforms, their lifetime value increases significantly.\n\nShares have dropped and trade at a price-to-sales valuation that is in line with leading cybersecurity providers, Looking at the valuation from another angle, the stock is trading at a multiple of 35 times trailing free cash flow.\n\nWhen factoring in another year's worth of revenue and free cash flow growth, the stock could be on pace to hit the analyst's price target within the next year. The recent pullback in the shares should have reset near-term growth expectations, so market participants can return their focus to the company's long-term opportunities in the booming cybersecurity market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "You can call it a correction, a selloff, or maybe the beginning of a crash. Whatever term you use to describe it, equity prices are falling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is still up 8% in 2024, but it\u2019s down approximately 3% in April. That\u2019s bringing down valuations in sectors like cybersecurity. However, for long-term investors, this creates an opportunity to look for cybersecurity stocks to buy on the dip.\n\nCybersecurity has become a \u201cmust-have\u201d application. The prevalence of ransomware attacks is just one concerning trend as companies of all sizes reconcile the cost of cybersecurity along with the increasing costs of running their businesses.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s still a good time for investors to find cybersecurity stocks to buy. Despite lofty valuations, and in some cases an unclear path to profitability, cybersecurity stocks will grind higher in a higher interest rate environment. And when the economy recovers, these stocks will lead the way as corporate spending increases.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is a behemoth in the cybersecurity space with a $95 billion market cap. PANW stock is down about half a percent in 2024. That\u2019s because of the sharp sell-off that occurred during the company\u2019s last earnings report.\n\nAt that time, the company announced a new \u201cplatformization\u201d strategy. Specifically, it was going to try to capture more market share by allowing customers to have free access to some of its services. While analysts were caught off guard, it could turn out to be a savvy move as Palo Alto attempts to counteract the spending fatigue its customers are feeling.\n\nThe resulting forecasts are showing much slower growth that caused analysts to reprice PANW stock. \u00a0In fairness, shareholders haven\u2019t suffered too much. PANW stock is still up 60% in the last 12 months even after falling about 15% since the last earnings report.\n\nAnalysts project 16% earnings growth for Palo Alto in the next 12 months. And the consensus price target of $334.35 would give PANW stock a 14.13% upside. Also, with short interest lower in the last month, there\u2019s less friction heading into the next round of earnings.\n\nZScaler (ZS) a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related icons. cheap cybersecurity stocks. multibagger cybersecurity stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nZScaler (NYSE:ZS) is a leader in cloud-native cybersecurity solutions. The company specializes in zero-trust applications in which every attempt to access a network, even by high-level company executives, is considered a potential threat. This combination makes ZScaler\u2019s offerings cost-effective and easy to scale.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat aside, ZS stock is down 21.25% in 2024 with the entirety of that loss coming after the company\u2019s February earnings report. A report, by the way, in which the company beat on both the top and bottom lines. One reason may be that ZScaler is not profitable today, and it won\u2019t be for some time even with ideal market conditions.\n\nStill, there was nothing in the company\u2019s report that suggests a lack of growth. And the zero trust market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% through 2030. With that in mind, investors should regard this as a normal pullback and continue to regard ZScaler as one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Contrary to what the name suggests, this is the front line of a company\u2019s cybersecurity defense. It means that every device (e.g. laptop, server, workstation, mobile device) can be an opportunity (and risk for the company) for cyber criminals to exploit and capture corporate data.\n\nThis has been the case with many of the recent ransomware attacks. In 2023, Gartner Research named CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform as one of the best endpoint security platforms of the 16 it evaluated.\n\nAnd based on CrowdStrike\u2019s growing annual recurring revenue (ARR) the company\u2019s customers continue to see the value that its services provide.\n\nCRWD stock is up 17% in 2024. However, the stock has been falling in April and the story is familiar to the other stocks on this list. A good earnings report, but investors perhaps feel the stock got overvalued.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Insiders Sold US$20m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\n\nAlthough we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Chairman & CEO, Nikesh Arora, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$17m worth of shares at a price of US$226 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$291, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 13% of Nikesh Arora's holding.\n\nPalo Alto Networks insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nI will like Palo Alto Networks better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this freelist of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\nDoes Palo Alto Networks Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Palo Alto Networks insiders own 1.0% of the company, currently worth about US$900m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Palo Alto Networks Insiders?\n\nThe fact that there have been no Palo Alto Networks insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Palo Alto Networks, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 shouldn't be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at them before investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course Palo Alto Networks may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this freecollection of high quality companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nearly Tripled the S&amp;P 500's Returns in 2023: Here Are the Stocks She's Been Buying",
        "content": "Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has multiple major accomplishments on her resume. She's been a U.S. Representative for nearly 37 years. She's the first female Speaker of the House and the first woman to lead either chamber of Congress. Is she also a market-beating investor?\n\nThe former House Speaker nearly tripled the S&P 500's returns in 2023, giving her the ninth-best returns among members of Congress, according to options trading platform operator Unusual Whales. However, all of Pelosi's disclosures of trades listed her husband, Paul Pelosi, as the owner.\n\nPelosi's recent purchases\n\nOver the last 12 months, Pelosi has purchased only two stocks. Both are also favorites of many other investors.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, the former Speaker's husband exercised 50 call options to buy 5,000 shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for $80 per share. Apple's current share price is more than double this purchase price.\n\nMr. Pelosi has owned Apple stock for years. Other members of Congress or their families have also invested in the tech giant. Apple was second on the list of stocks lawmakers bought the most in 2023.\n\nOn the same day of the Apple transaction, Pelosi also exercised 50 call options to purchase 5,000 shares of Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) for $180 per share. As with Apple, Microsoft's current share price is more than twice the strike price of those options.\n\nMore options\n\nThe initial purchases of the moneymaking call options for Apple and Microsoft were made in 2022. Paul Pelosi has been buying more call options on other stocks in recent months.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2023, Mr. Pelosi bought 50 call options for Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) with a strike price of $120 and an expiration date of Dec. 20. 2024. At the time, Nvidia's share price was around $488.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 2024, Pelosi purchased 50 call options for Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. Palo Alto Networks' share price then hovered around $372.\n\nA few days later on Feb. 21, 2024, the former Speaker's husband bought 20 more call options for Palo Alto Networks. Again, the strike price was $200 with an expiration date of Jan. 17, 2025. The stock had fallen significantly, though, to around $262.\n\nCall options with a strike price lower than the current share price are known as \"in-the-money\" options. Buying in-the-money call options lowers investors' upfront costs and limits the risk of loss while allowing them to profit from upward moves for the underlying stock.\n\nAre Pelosi's picks good choices now?\n\nValuation is a concern with all four stocks Pelosi likes. Apple's sluggish growth arguably doesn't justify its forward price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 26. Microsoft and Nvidia trade at well above 30 times forward earnings, while Palo Alto Networks' forward earnings multiple is a sky-high 47.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia should profit from the generative AI boom for years to come. The need for cybersecurity solutions should grow, boosting Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks. I think Pelosi's picks are good choices for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $537,557!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0American Politicians are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nDespite lofty valuations of mega-cap technology companies on the back of the generative AI boom, the AI craze seems to have no end in sight as investors begin to pour money into AI-focused pick-and-shovel companies that will actually power AI applications to be used by millions of people. Major technology companies that have been the laggards in the AI race are coming up with new AI-focused initiatives to please investors.\n\nApple Strikes Back with AI Plans\n\nFor example, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been having a rough year so far amid iPhone sales growth concerns, rebounded this month after reports that the company was planning to launch refreshed M4-equipped Macs that will specialize in AI applications. A Bloomberg report cited Daniel Skelly, Head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research and Strategy Team, who said that Apple will \"come back\" as the company is expected to provide more \"clarity\" and \"visibility\" for its AI pipeline. Another latest report from Bloomberg said that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with OpenAI to integrate AI features into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s iOS 18.\n\nThe net effect of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI efforts is highly positive and has ushered a new interest from investors in the stock. Bloomberg cited JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee, who said that hedge funds are starting to \"warm up\" to the opportunity of Apple's \"AI upgrade cycle.\"\n\nA New AI-Focused ETF Craze\n\nRetail investors as well as hedge funds are piling into AI stocks like there's no tomorrow. A Bloomberg report recently highlighted a latest trend in Taiwan where people are investing their entire savings in AI-focused ETFs. Bloomberg data shows that Taiwanese have invested a whopping $50 billion in ETFs tracking local stocks. This is up about 80% from the year-ago period. Most of this surge came after the AI boom started. Taiwan Semiconductor, which is the top supplier of chips to NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), has seen its stock price surge by over 60% over the past one year.\n\nAI Stocks Have More Room to Run, BlackRock Strategist Says\n\nDespite all these gains, analysts believe AI stocks are just getting started. BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li recently said that earnings trajectory and guidance of companies show that this is a \"forward-looking\" market when it comes to AI. She said that many companies, including the ones in the Magnificent Seven group, were punished because of their guidance or earnings because the \"bar\" has been raised. She expects AI opportunities beyond just the tech sector, and mentioned healthcare, financials and industrials.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Opportunities in Datacenter and Utilities\n\nData center and utilities companies are the biggest examples of the spillover effects of AI gains. Power demand and data center solutions will see a huge rise in the coming months and years as AI software solutions go live, to be used by millions of users worldwide. Electricity company Exelon's CEO Calvin Butler recently said that AI would drive a 900% increase in power demand from data centers in the Chicago area.\n\nData center company Vertiv in its latest earnings call talked about how it's seeing AI-related momentum in its business:\n\n\"We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n\nWe are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n\nSupply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that\u2019s where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we\u2019re executing reflect that yet.\n\nThere is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here. American Politicians are Buying These AI Stocks\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMethodology\n\nIt's not just the hedge funds or retail investors that piling into AI stocks. In this article we decided to see which AI stocks American politicians like. For that we used publicly available data of American Congress members and senators and picked 10 AI stocks that saw buying from politicians in the US over the past few months. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to see what Washington insiders, corporate executives and hedge funds are buying? \u00a0Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n10. IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nIBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) is one of the stocks that have strong growth catalysts because of the AI boom. Earlier this year, investment firm Evercore called IBM Common Stock (NYSE:IBM) an \"overlooked beneficiary of increasing AI adoption.\" On March 11, Congressman Lloyd Doggett bought\u00a0a stake in IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM)\u00a0worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then, IBM Common Stock\u00a0(NYSE:IBM)\u00a0shares have declined by 5%.\n\nDiamond Hill Long-Short Fund stated the following regarding International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOther bottom contributors included our short positions in Garmin and\u00a0International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), as well as our long position in Chevron. IBM\u2019s software and consulting businesses were solid in the quarter, helping drive revenue growth. But the company faces numerous fundamental headwinds in both these businesses, and we expect it will struggle to meet cash-flow guidance.\u201d\n\n9. Texas Instruments Inc (NASDAQ:TXN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 55\n\nSemiconductor company Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0is one of the companies that can benefit from the AI boom. Republican Congressman Kevin Hern on February 13 bought\u00a0shares of Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0worth between $1,000 to $15,000. Since then the stock has gained about 5.5%.\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 55 funds reported having stakes in Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN). The biggest stakeholder of Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN)\u00a0during this period was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which had a $728 million stake in Texas Instruments Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TXN).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cShares of semiconductor manufacturing company\u00a0Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) underperformed as revenue guidance was slightly below market expectations. We believe these demand trends to be transitory and have a favorable view of the company\u2019s long-term prospects and superior competitive position.\u201d\n\n8. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 77\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) saw interest from Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the most important politician in America when it comes to stock trading. Pelosi's spouse on February 21 bought\u00a0call options for Palo Alto Networks Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:PANW)\u00a0worth between $100,001 - $250,000\u00a0with a strike price of $200 and an expiration date of 1/17/25.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cGiven our view that the overall market looks expensive, mostly due to mega cap valuations, the low likelihood that technology can continue to deliver well above market returns and an expected slowdown in economic growth, risk management has guided our recent positioning activity. We have been consistently trimming from the select bucket and redeploying into undervalued stable and cyclical names, while also being cognizant of position sizing to maintain the latitude to add to names when prices become attractive.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we continued to trim IT stocks into strength to manage risk while also adding to high-conviction positions. For example, we trimmed our active weight in\u00a0Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) after the information security software maker lowered its guidance in part due to a new emphasis on providing short-term discounts on product bundles to pursue its consolidation opportunity more aggressively. While this strategy should position the company more strongly in the future, it potentially increases volatility in operating results in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\n\n7. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 78\n\nQualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks seventh in our list of the best AI stocks to buy according to American Congress members.\n\nEarlier this month, Benchmark started covering Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock with a Buy rating and a $200 price target. Benchmark analyst Cody Acree said Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) was positioned well to capitalize on the trend of moving artificial intelligence workloads towards edge computing. On February 12, Congressman Earl Blumenauer bought\u00a0a stake worth between $1,000 to $15,000 in Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM). Since then through April 22 Qualcomm Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:QCOM)\u00a0shares have gained about 5.4%.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) also reported a solid fourth fiscal quarter with better than expected results. The company guided the first quarter ahead of expectations despite headwinds from Samsung as the inventory headwinds dissipate. Qualcomm remains well positioned in the mobile handset market and should benefit as Artificial Intelligence moves to edge devices which could drive an upgrade cycle.\u201d\n\n6. ServiceNow Inc (NYSE:NOW)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 91\n\nOn January 25, Congressman Josh Gottheimer bought\u00a0a stake worth between $1000 to $15,000 in ServiceNow Inc\u00a0(NYSE:NOW). Since then the stock is up about 2%.\n\nIn December, Macquarie Equity Research increased its price target for ServiceNow Inc\u00a0(NYSE:NOW)\u00a0to $800 from $612, citing generative AI potential.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe trimmed our positions in Adobe and\u00a0ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) earlier in the quarter as we believe positive AI narratives had driven the valuations of both companies higher than we felt was comfortable relative to their weighting in the Portfolio. We believe both companies will likely have incremental revenue and profits from generative AI products they incorporate into their offerings, such as Firefly for Adobe and Now Assist for ServiceNow. However, we do not expect them to be substantial revenue contributors in the near term. As such, we felt it was prudent to reduce the weightings and reallocate to other positions at better valuations.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see American Politicians are Buying These 5 AI Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nInsiders are Amassing These 10 Stocks in April 10 Stocks You Should Not Buy According to Jim Cramer 10 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.None.

For instance, under network security, it offers next-generation firewalls, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), Security Services Edge (SSE) and six other products with category leadership.\n\nPalo Alto offers a compelling case to enterprise customers who want to consolidate vendors. Moreover, its products are recognized for their leadership. For instance, Gartner has recognized Palo Alto as a leader in its Magic Quadrants in single-vendor SASE, endpoint protection platforms, security service edge, network firewalls and SD-WAN.\n\nIn February, PANW stock sold off after its earnings report due to its platformization efforts. That being said, it was another solid report, with revenues up 19% year-over-year to $1.98 billion. And despite a shift of strategy to accelerated platformization, management expects 15% to 16% revenue growth in FY2024.\n\nPalo Alto Networks will continue to profit from cyber spending and benefit from vendor consolidation. Buy the stock on this bout of weakness.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nEndpoint security has been one of the areas enterprises have focused on to prevent ransomware attacks. As one of the best endpoint platforms, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is poised to profit from security investment dollars.\n\nOver the years, industry research has rated CrowdStrike\u2019s Falcon platform as one of the best security platforms. In 2023, Gartner named it a leader in endpoint security platforms among the sixteen vendors it evaluated. Its extended detection and response (XDR) platform was rated best for its ability to execute and completeness of vision.\n\nLeveraging its leadership and cloud-native platform, CrowdStrike has maintained industry-leading growth rates while delivering impressive free cash flow. Full-year FY2024 revenues increased by 36% to $3.06 billion. Meanwhile, free cash flow increased from $676.8 million in fiscal 2023 to $938.2 million.\n\nMoreover, the company expects a solid FY2025 as customers adopt more of its Falcon modules. It expects total revenue between $3.924 and $3.989 billion, translating to at least 28% growth. That\u2019s why analysts are extremely bullish on CRWD stock.\n\nCurrently, CrowdStrike is a consensus buy among analysts with 38 buy and 7 overweight ratings. No analyst rates the stock a sell or underweight, making it one of the top cybersecurity stocks. Moreover, the average price target of $398 represents over 30% upside.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) offers one of the highest revenue growth rates among top cybersecurity stocks. Its AI-powered security solutions have enjoyed strong demand from large enterprises and mid-market companies. As a result, FY2023 and FY2024 revenues grew by 106% and 47%, respectively.\n\nDespite these impressive growth rates, investors have been slow to embrace the stock due to its poor profitability. However, management has stated it will focus on profitability and margin improvement in FY2025. I believe S stock has substantial upside, especially after it sold off on Q4 FY2024 results due to conservative guidance.\n\nSentinelOne\u2019s competitive position in endpoint security has allowed it to continue to win business. In Q4 FY2024, customers with annual recurring revenue of $100,000 or more grew 30% YOY to 1,133. Indeed, growth has never been an issue for SentinelOne; profitability has been the challenge.\n\nManagement has set a goal of achieving profitability by the end of FY2025. Q4 non-GAAP gross margins of 78% were in the long-term target range and management expects FY2025 margins between 77.5% and 78.5%. It will also deliver positive operating income and free cash flow by year-end.\n\nSentinelOne\u2019s revenue guidance of $812-818 million in FY2025 represents 30% growth. Reaching profitability will be an inflection point for this growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

AEP\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Danaher, Regeneron and Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Danaher Corp., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nDanaher's shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+24.0% vs. +3.4%). The company's stable demand in the academic and applied markets is supporting its Life Sciences unit. The segment has been witnessing positive responses toward its new products. The company's commitment to return value to shareholders is encouraging.\r\n\r\nSynergies from the Abcam acquisition bolster the company's growth. Through its DBS initiatives, it has been able to reduce the impact of supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures. However, Danaher is plagued by weakness in the Biotechnology unit due to decreased demand in the bioprocessing business.\r\n\r\nSoftness in the funding environment and lower underlying activity levels are affecting the high-growth markets' performance. High debt levels may raise its financial obligations and drain its profitability. Given its international exposure, forex woes are weighing on its top line.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Danaher here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+14.9% vs. -15.2%). The company maintains momentum due to stellar performance by Dupixent, driven by growing demand in the approved indications of atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.\r\n\r\nThe approval of Eylea HD is also noteworthy, generating incremental revenues. The approval of Libtayo has diversified the portfolio, and label expansion in additional indications is likely to boost Regeneron's sales.\r\n\r\nHowever, a decline in Eylea sales due to competition is a woe as the drug is the largest contributor to the top line. Pipeline and regulatory setbacks are additional headwinds.

The company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW's strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Workday, Inc. and American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "With 82% ownership in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Palo Alto Networks' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 46% of the company Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nA look at the shareholders of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAnd things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$5.3b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 60% and last week\u2019s gain was the icing on the cake.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Palo Alto Networks.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nWe can see that Palo Alto Networks does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Palo Alto Networks' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Palo Alto Networks is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.5%. With 7.6% and 3.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that Palo Alto Networks, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$910m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Palo Alto Networks. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Palo Alto Networks has  2 warning signs  (and 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  we think you should know about.\n\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "We\u2019re still not prepared for cyberattacks.\u00a0That includes the U.S. government, hospitals, corporations and millions of people all over the world. Most recently, telecom Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FYBR) was forced to shut down certain systems following an attack on when a third party \u201cgained unauthorized access to portions of its information technology environment,\u201d as noted by Seeking Alpha. All of which is creating a big opportunity for leading, multibagger cybersecurity stocks.\n\nSmall medical practices are being forced to close because of the February 21 Change Healthcare cyberattack. Also,\u00a0according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF):\n\n\u201cThe\u00a0risk of extreme losses from cyber incidents is increasing. Such losses could potentially cause funding problems for companies and even jeopardize their solvency. The size of these extreme losses has more than quadrupled since 2017 to $2.5 billion. And indirect losses like reputational damage or security upgrades are substantially higher.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUnfortunately, even after all of the attacks over the years, and warnings to be prepared, we\u2019re still sitting ducks. All of which is creating big opportunities for leading, multibagger cybersecurity stocks.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter gapping from about $370 to about $260, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is now consolidating around $282. From here, I\u2019d like to see it initially retest $320. PANW is one of the top multibagger cybersecurity stocks to buy on weakness.\n\nJust weeks ago, the company cut its full-year revenue guidance to a new range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion from $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion. It also cut its full-year billings outlook to a new range of\u00a0$10.1 billion to $10.2 billion, from $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.\n\nThat\u2019s why PANW fell apart. However, it appears most of that bad news has been firmly priced into the oversold stock. Plus, analysts at Argus just reiterated a buy on PANW with a price target of $336. All as the cybersecurity environment gets a bit more toxic, especially with generative artificial intelligence.\n\nUnfortunately, cybersecurity issues will only get worse. All because of how poorly prepared we are for attacks. Plus, with recent geopolitical issues, the threat only rises more. Considering PANW is the industry\u2019s 800 lb. gorilla, it\u2019s sure to benefit.\n\nFortinent (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at leading, multibagger cybersecurity stocks like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), which is technically oversold at $63.69. It\u2019s also over-extended on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R. The last time it became this technically oversold, it bounced from about $45 to 60 shortly after. The time before it bounced from about $56.10 to $65.68. I\u2019m looking for a similar bounce back this time around, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nHelping, RBC Capital reiterated its hold rating on the stock with a price target of $71 a share. We\u2019ll also get a better idea of how FTNT is doing when it posts earnings on May 2. In its last earnings report, the company\u2019s earnings per share of 51 cents beat by eight cents. Revenue of $1.42 billion \u2014 up about 11% year over year \u2014 beat by $10 million. Total billings came in at $1.86 billion, an 8.5% year-over-year jump from $1.72 billion.\n\nFor its first quarter, the company said it expects revenue to fall in the range of $1.3 billion and $1.36 billion, as compared to estimates for $1.38 billion.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nKeep an eye on oversold shares of Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), too.\n\nAfter testing $259.61, it dropped to $170.97, where it\u2019s now oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R. It\u2019s also sitting at support dating back to November. The last time ZS became this technically oversold in May 2023, it bounced from about $90 to a high of $162.67. I\u2019m hoping for a similar move again this time, too.\n\nHelping, earnings have been strong.\u00a0\u00a0In its second quarter, the company\u2019s EPS of 76 cents beat by 18 cents.\u00a0Revenue of $525 million \u2014 up 35.4% year over year \u2014 beat by $18.17 million. For fiscal year 2024, the company also expects to grow revenue by 31% year over year to $2.12 billion. It also expects for its operating income to come in around $397.5 million, with a margin of 18% to 19%, up from 15% in 2023.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie also has an outperform rating on ZS with a price target of $245. The firm added that it\u2019s one of two cybersecurity firms well-positioned to benefit from spending following the healthcare company hacks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "With geopolitical flashpoints poised to worsen, investors ought to target stocks to buy for global conflict. I don\u2019t look at this theme as advantaging tragedies. Rather, it\u2019s a matter of sensibly adjusting one\u2019s portfolio to reflect rapidly shifting realities.\n\nYes, the headlines have been focused on the Middle East. The tit-for-tat missile attacks that Iran and Israel have launched against each other have rattled nerves. While the current media response from both sides suggest a collective effort to cool tensions, a miscalculation could easily spiral circumstances out of control.\n\nHowever, the big issue in my opinion is the U.S. House of Representatives passing $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. That sends a clear message to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin that the U.S. and western forces will continue to support the embattled nation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHaving no off-ramp (because the government didn\u2019t take it earlier in the conflict), the Russians will continue their belligerence. With that in mind, investors need to get serious about these stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is a powerhouse in the aerospace and defense sector. Responsible for developing and manufacturing a variety of weapons systems, it will almost surely play a pivotal role in the preparation for future conflicts. Of course, the defense space presents controversies regarding stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nHowever, in the words of Billy Joel, \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire.\u201d Certain nations unfortunately continue to abide by imperialistic directives. At some point, a major conflict is inevitable. The fundamental justification for supporting U.S. allies and interests abroad is the ability to prosecute violations of the international order from a position of strength.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s easier to put out a house fire than a forest fire. But the prospect of a major conflagration materializing has heightened. Therefore, the need to prepare should bode well for Lockheed Martin.\n\nTo be fair, analysts only rate shares a consensus hold, driven by muted sales growth forecasts. However, it\u2019s my opinion that this dynamic could change in a hurry. Therefore, LMT is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Mr. Joel is adamant that his generation didn\u2019t start any fires, the reality is that the geopolitical snowballing effect means that we must deal with the consequences today. Defense contractor AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is what happens when strategic efforts of containment and/or de-escalation fails and the bullets start flying. At that point, you need a response and that\u2019s where AeroVironment comes in.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don\u2019t want to use the term to avoid getting pinged by the politically correct algorithms. AeroVironment makes \u201cself-harm\u201d drones if you get my drift. Notably, the company states that its drones were instrumental in changing the Ukraine war\u2019s landscape. With these weapons systems, military operations were able to hit high-value targets while protecting themselves via distance.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, covering experts anticipate that revenue will hit $708.15 million, up 31% from last year\u2019s print of $540.54 million. That\u2019s a major reason why shares have done so well. Moving forward, experts see a reduced sales growth rate of 13.4% for fiscal 2025.\n\nHowever, I believe with AeroVironment proving itself in combat, demand will be higher than anticipated. That\u2019s why AVAV is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNot every idea for stocks to buy for global conflict has to involve defense contractors. Given the turmoil that geopolitical flashpoints can cause, the fear trade should cynically blossom. If so, you\u2019ll want to keep close tabs on Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). An exploration, production and mine development specialist, Barrick could benefit from multiple catalysts.\n\nThe first catalyst is an obvious one \u2013 inflation. That\u2019s not just from the geopolitical realm. Rather, the U.S. economy continues to impress analysts with stronger-than-expected jobs reports. While that\u2019s a positive development, it also means that more dollars are chasing after fewer goods. That will likely make the dollar relatively devalued, which may mean higher prices for gold.\n\nSecond, the yellow metal has historically played the role of safe-haven asset. With multiple flashpoints materializing throughout the world, a miscalculation could send matters spiraling out of control. I hate to say it but in many ways, that\u2019s gold positive.\n\nCovering experts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $21.30 average price target. Based on current conditions, it\u2019s an attractive and relevant idea.\n\nSibanye Stillwater (SBSW) Person holding smartphone with logo of South African mining company Sibanye Stillwater Limited on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to gold plays, better options exist than Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW). Sure, the sector suffered from significant challenges related to earlier fears of interest rate hikes. But with inflation proving to be stickier than anticipated, precious metals may enjoy a long relevancy lifespan. However, SBSW stock is attractive not just because of the gold situation but because of the underlying palladium business.\n\nAs an industrial metal, palladium finds significant use in the automotive sector. It\u2019s a critical commodity for the development of catalytic converters. Remember those stories about thieves cutting up exhaust systems? Palladium \u2013 or more specifically its high market value \u2013 is the reason why.\n\nWhat\u2019s really intriguing here on a cynical basis is that electric vehicle sales are suffering. Further, hybrid vehicle demand is skyrocketing, which means palladium demand should rise as well. There\u2019s just one problem: Russia is the world\u2019s biggest producer of palladium.\n\nOf course, the west refuses to do business with the Russians. That means we have to turn to South Africa (where Sibanye is based) for increased palladium production. Do the math. SBSW is one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA technology player, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) specializes in cybersecurity. Per its public profile, the company primarily offers firewall appliances and software. In addition, it provides a security management solution for the global control of network security as a virtual or physical appliance. With cyber threats sprouting in both scope and scale, it\u2019s never been more vital for enterprises to protect themselves.\n\nFundamentally, PANW is easily one of the stocks to buy for global conflict. Unlike prior geopolitical flashpoints, the fighting doesn\u2019t just occur in the physical paradigm. Rather, combatants and their advocates engage in an informational war. A clear example of this is Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The Federal Bureau of Investigation seeks to arrest multiple Russian agents for conspiracy charges.\n\nFurther, data from Statista reveals that Russia is the major source of phishing attacks around the globe. With that, analysts unsurprisingly see 15.9% growth in the top line to $7.99 billion for fiscal 2024. Next year, this figure could rise to $9.13 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nIron Mountain (IRM) Iron Mountain (IRM) logo on truck\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStructured as a real estate investment trust or REIT, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) mixes an old-school business model with modern security services. Per its corporate profile, Iron Mountain is a global leader in information management services. Originally, it started as a platform for protecting its clients\u2019 documents and assets. Later on, it began providing digital storage and security solutions.\n\nIn any scenario, it\u2019s vital for enterprises \u2013 especially government agencies \u2013 to keep important documents and records away from the source infrastructure. You just never know what might happen, from accidents to environmental calamities. Further, the geopolitical backdrop suggests that adversarial nations and entities can attempt to compromise American businesses and infrastructure. Therefore, document and asset storage and protection has never been more important.\n\nNotably, this dynamic has not been ignored on Wall Street. Instead, experts anticipate that current fiscal year revenue could hit $6.09 billion. If so, we\u2019re talking about an 11.1% growth rate from last year\u2019s print of $5.48 billion. Lastly, IRM carries a unanimous strong buy rating. So, it\u2019s a great candidate for stocks to buy for global conflict.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocused on the consulting services sector, Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting, analytics, engineering, digital solutions, mission operations, and cyber services to governments, corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. Primarily, BAH is a candidate for stocks to buy for global conflict due to its relevance in the information war space.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, Booz Allen addresses the Department of Defense\u2019s most vital challenges. In particular, the technology consultation firm provides command, control and communications and battle management. In addition, the firm helps in the field of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, along with electronic warfare. That\u2019s going to be especially crucial given the cunning nature of modern-day threats.\n\nRecently, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that China is developing the \u201cability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a time of its choosing.\u201d Therefore, it\u2019s essential to have a response ready. Just as significantly, the response needs to be measured, demonstrating that America means business without inviting unnecessary escalation.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that fiscal 2024 revenue will hit $10.61 billion, up 14.5% from last year. That\u2019s more than a credible forecast based on current realities.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Earnings season is a time when many companies redeem themselves. It doesn\u2019t take much for a beaten down stock to turnaround. A strong quarterly print and upbeat guidance can lead to a big reversal higher in a share price. The stock of United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) just rose 17% in a single day after the carrier issued better-than-expected financial results and offered a bullish outlook to Wall Street. The post-earnings bump pushed UAL stock into positive territory for the year.\n\nSo, whose next? Which beaten down stocks are also likely to move sharply higher when they report first quarter 2024 financial results in the coming weeks? There are plenty of candidates given that many well-known and popular names have seen their share price slide lower since the start of the year while the broader market rallied between January and March. Forget the noise: buy these three unfairly punished stocks before earnings euphoria hits.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) fell more than 20% and logged their worst one-day performance ever after the company\u2019s last earnings print. Analysts seemed to agree that the selloff was an overreaction and remain bullish on PANW stock. The company could be in for a bounce back quarter after it reports 2024 first quarter results on May 28. Year to date, the stock is down 2%, which is uncharacteristic. Through five years, PANW stock is up 245%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks did manage to beat Wall Street forecasts with its most recent financial results. The problem was with the guidance. The company lowered its full-year guidance for both revenue and billings, sending investors heading for the hills. Management linked the lowered guidance to a shift in strategy, wanting to accelerate growth in artificial intelligence (AI) products. They also said that markets misinterpreted the guidance that was provided. Look for a big clarification during the next earnings print.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt seems strange that shares of the Golden Arches are in decline. But the stock of McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) has fallen nearly 10% this year and is down 7% over the last 12 months. The share price drop comes despite McDonald\u2019s posting consistently strong financial results, raising its dividend, and undertaking an ambitious growth strategy. Most recently, McDonald\u2019s announced a partnership with Krispy Kreme (NASDAQ:DNUT) that will see its doughnuts sold at McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Krispy Kreme deal comes as McDonald\u2019s diversifies its menu amid a big growth push. Last December, management announced plans to open 9,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program by 2027. The company is also launching a new spin-off brand called \u201cCosMc\u2019s\u201d that\u2019s aimed at teens and twentysomethings. Look for MCD stock to pop if McDonald\u2019s earnings on April 30 show the strategies are bolstering sales and profits.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike\u2019s (NYSE:NKE) stock has been unfairly punished and is likely to rise with improved earnings and as the Summer Olympics in Paris, France approach. This is the conclusion of analysts at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), which recently upgraded NKE stock to a \u201cbuy\u201d rating from \u201cneutral\u201d previously and increased their price target on the shares to $113 from $110. Bank of America said in its upgrade that earnings estimates for the sneaker maker \u201cfinally look achievable.\u201d\n\nAnalysts also cited an upcoming catalyst with the Paris Olympics. Nike makes the uniforms for Team USA. NKE stock has been terrible for several years now. So far in 2024, the company\u2019s share price is down 11%. Its 12-month performance is negative 25%. Problems have included bloated inventories and slowing sales in China. Watch for the company to show progress in those troubled areas when it next reports earnings on June 25. Any positive signs are likely to send NKE stock higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Got $1,000? 2 Tech Stocks to Buy That Could Double Your Money",
        "content": "Doubling your money in the stock market isn't as hard as you might think. Thanks to the power of compounding, it only takes a few years of decent returns to get that result. If you choose the right stocks.\n\nOf course, many stocks have jumped by 100% or more amid the market rally over the past 15 months. Yet it only requires about six years of growth at a 12% compound annual rate to double your investment.\n\nYou could get close to those returns by simply owning an S&P 500 index fund. The wider market has gained about 15% per year over the past decade, on average. Yet investors can aim for even better results by also buying individual growth stocks. Let's look at two stocks that have a great chance of outperforming the market from here.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe cybersecurity industry is a critical one that's becoming an even bigger priority as enterprises migrate more work onto the cloud. Consider buying shares of Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) to get exposure to this attractive space.\n\nWith $7 billion in revenue in the past full fiscal year, Palo Alto Networks is a leader in the cybersecurity niche. It's boosting that sales footprint at an impressive clip lately, and revenue is on track to rise by almost 20% this year after jumping 25% in 2023. Palo Alto Networks recently became profitable and management is intent on extending that positive momentum. Look for operating profit margin to rise in 2024 and beyond following last year's 5-percentage-point improvement.\n\nIt's true that you could benefit from growth in the industry by owning a more diversified software company like Microsoft. But Palo Alto Networks provides a more targeted investment in cybersecurity, and thus a better chance at above-average returns for patient investors.\n\n2. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is already a large company, but there's plenty of room for the software-as-a-service giant to grow from here. The business helps customers with the creation of digital content and experiences, putting it in an ideal position to capitalize on emerging trends around generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nExcitement for the new tech has powered higher demand for Adobe's subscription services, helping accelerate sales gains this past year. \"We've done an incredible job harnessing the power of AI to deliver groundbreaking innovation across our portfolio,\" CEO Shantanu Narayen said in mid-March.\n\nThe problem is that the software giant hasn't yet demonstrated that it can make money from these innovations. Net income fell by 50% in the most recent quarter as Adobe spent more in areas like research and development (R&D) and marketing. Those stumbles help explain why the stock trails the market by a wide margin so far in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors who take advantage of that discount could see excellent returns over the next several years. Adobe's profit trends are being temporarily held back this year by costs associated with its canceled acquisition of Figma, after all. Those expenses, including a $1 billion hit to earnings in 2024, won't repeat.\n\nThe bigger factor to watch this year is how Adobe begins capitalizing on the excitement around its AI-powered tools. The first part of that plan is working well, as subscription levels have jumped for products like Photoshop and its creative cloud platform. Rising prices will follow, reflecting the increased value that users are getting from these offerings. And as Adobe's earnings growth speeds up, shareholders should be thrilled with the returns they're seeing\u00a0from this software giant.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Adobe right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Adobe wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $466,882!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "It hasn't been the best quarter for Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 18% in that time. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. We think most investors would be happy with the 239% return, over that period. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the five years of share price growth, Palo Alto Networks moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.\n\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Palo Alto Networks has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this freeinteractive graphic.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Palo Alto Networks shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 28%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Palo Alto Networks better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Palo Alto Networks (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant) .\n\nBut note: Palo Alto Networks may not be the best stock to buy.

        "content": "Cybersecurity stocks have been going through a tough stretch. Many cybersecurity firms that have dominated the stock market since the pandemic (and even before that point) have been losing momentum.\n\nEarnings misses, reduced guidance and frothy valuations fill the industry. This combination of factors makes it more difficult to find quality cybersecurity stock, especially pure plays. While many firms are experiencing slowdowns, the cybersecurity industry is here to stay. It\u2019s projected to achieve a\u00a0compounded annual growth rate of 12.3% until 2030.\n\nBusinesses need to keep themselves safe from hackers. Too much data and assets are at risk. These three cybersecurity stocks to buy now are companies that can protect businesses and generate long-term returns for shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now for investors who don\u2019t mind a high valuation. Unlike most competitors, Crowdstrike is still growing at an impressive rate. The cybersecurity firm recently reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Guidance suggests that revenue growth will remain high.\n\nThe firm generates a good chunk of its revenue through a recurring business model. Annual recurring revenue grew by 34% year-over-year to reach $3.44 billion. The company also expanded its profit margins with $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year.\n\nInvestors have noticed and are continuing to accumulate the stock. Shares are up by 25% year-to-date and trade at a\u00a078-forward P/E ratio. If vast profit margin expansion continues, the stock can grow in its valuation. A good compounded annual growth rate for the cybersecurity industry combined with weaknesses from its competitors suggests Crowdstrike can capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) was once a heralded cybersecurity stock until a recent earnings report dragged down the stock price. The stock is down by 3% year-to-date but has gained 240% over the past five years.\n\nRevenue grew by 19% year-over-year in\u00a0Q2 FY24,\u00a0a lower growth rate than previous quarters. The company had been generating 25% year-over-year revenue growth in previous quarters. Palo Alto Networks generated $135.5 million in income before income taxes during the quarter. Using this distinction is important since the company received a $1.6 billion benefit from income taxes. That\u2019s why the company has an inflated net income of $1.7 billion in GAAP, which isn\u2019t an accurate metric for gauging the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncome before income taxes increased from $118.8 million in Q2 FY23 to $135.5 million in the most recent quarter. That\u2019s a 14% year-over-year growth rate. The company anticipates revenue growth to range from 13% to 15% in Q3 FY24.\n\nThe big drop may present a long-term buying opportunity. The stock has an average rating of \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and an implied 20% upside. Recent post-earnings price targets have been mostly positive and indicate the stock can gain more than 20%.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

Most of the company\u2019s revenue comes from cloud computing. The platform helps businesses run more efficiently, but it\u2019s also a digital resource companies have to protect.\n\nThe tech giant has a suite of cybersecurity software and recently announced\u00a0Copilot for Security to gain more market share. This feature makes cybersecurity more accessible for individuals and small businesses. Copilot is the company\u2019s artificial intelligence tool that has many users. It\u2019s not just for cybersecurity; the company\u2019s recent innovation will increase Copilot\u2019s adoption.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the stock market for many years and is up 225% over the past five years. Analysts are bullish on the stock and believe it can\u00a0increase by 12% from current levels. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d by 35 analysts. Recent price target hikes suggest the stock can gain more than 12%.

        "content": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ:PANW) recent performance, when its stock has declined 17% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Palo Alto Networks'  ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palo Alto Networks is:\n\n52% = US$2.3b \u00f7 US$4.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.52 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Palo Alto Networks' Earnings Growth And 52% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Palo Alto Networks has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Palo Alto Networks' exceptional 51% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Palo Alto Networks' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 15%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PANW worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PANW is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nGiven that Palo Alto Networks doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Palo Alto Networks' performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 10 best password managers in 2024. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Best Password Managers in 2024.\n\nOverview of the Password Manager Market\n\nPassword management software helps in the process of securing and managing passwords throughout the life-cycle of a password from its creation to termination. Password management service providers use internally encrypted vaults to protect private credentials while following strict ethical standards. According to a\u00a0report by Mordor Intelligence, the global password management market was valued at $1.74 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28.52% during the next five years to reach $7.32 billion by 2029. Two main factors driving growth for the market are the vast shift towards remote work after the pandemic and the subsequent increase in demand for password management software by small and medium businesses to protect their online business operations. Moreover, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest growth rate. According to a report by Acumen Research and Consulting, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 23% from 2022 to 2023. The growth in the region is attributed to its large number of emerging small and medium enterprises in economies including China, India, and Japan.\n\nWhile the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow the fastest, it also remains one of the most cyber threat-prone areas, accounting for 31% of the global cybersecurity threats in 2022. Regional governments are taking steps to protect key companies from being hacked. On February 26, Reuters\u00a0reported that China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology revealed its cybersecurity plan to protect the industrial sector by 2026. The plan aims to conduct around 30,000 data security training sessions and appoint 5,000 data security engineers to protect over 45,000 Chinese companies during the said period.

Viable estimates of the data breach cost help organizations achieve better risk management and optimize security investments, leading to a smooth strategic decision-making process. According to the Cost of a Data Breach Report by IBM Security, the average cost of a data breach increased by 2.3% in 2023, reaching an all-time high of $4.45 million. From a longer-term perspective, the average cost has continued to increase at an accelerated pace since COVID-19, which has increased by 15.3% from $3.86 million in 2020. As a result of this increment, 51% of the leading organizations worldwide are planning to increase their security investments to deter future cyber threats.

Security AI and automation help identify a breach faster and lead to quicker containment of the threat. According to the report by IBM, organizations using extensive security AI and automation were able to contain data breaches 108 days quicker than those with no use. Moreover, companies using these technologies incur 39.3% less in costs for a data breach than those with limited or no use of modern technologies.\n\nLeading Cybersecurity Companies\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc.

The company\u2019s financial standing solidifies upcoming growth projects. Additionally, significant long-term contracts that Innodata has landed offer revenue visibility and stability vital to propel valuation growth.\n\nWith a big tech customer, the business landed a three-year contract for around $23 million annually or\u00a0$69 million over the three years. Thus, long-term agreements give Innodata a stable top-line for smart resource planning and allocation. This large contract derives from the company\u2019s competitive stance and the perceived value of its services.\n\nTo conclude, the company wants to grow at a rate of\u00a020% annually by 2024. This is primarily by entering the enterprise and big tech sectors. Therefore, by concentrating on high-growth areas, Innodata fits industry trends and sets itself up for long-term growth, making it an ideal option among AI stocks.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) remaining performance obligations (RPO) grew by 22% (Q2 2024), while its top-line has attained a boost of 19%. This indicates that Palo Alto is sharply locking future income streams from its current contracts, implying that growth will continue steadily in the upcoming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Palo Alto emphasized its commitment to promoting client adoption of its integrated cybersecurity solutions while outlining its expedited\u00a0platformization and consolidation plan. The startup wants to benefit from the cybersecurity market\u2019s move toward platform-based solutions.\n\nCertainly, programs and activities aimed at reducing customer friction, speeding up product launches and promoting vendor consolidation help Palo Alto\u2019s platformization ambitions. These initiatives include incentives to standardize estate rollout, no-cost introductory offers and legacy trade-ins to ease the transition to Palo Alto\u2019s integrated platforms.\n\nFurther, Palo Alto\u2019s platformization approach is anticipated to affect the company\u2019s financial performance in the medium to long run. However, platformization initiatives may initially put pressure on billing growth.\n\nFinally, Palo Alto\u2019s platformization approach also projects the company\u2019s long-term objectives forward. This includes boosting its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $15 billion by 2030 and attaining industry-leading non-GAAP operating margins.\n\nSoundHound (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

SoundHound had a considerable rise in revenue in Q4 2023, coming in at $17.1 million, reflecting a massive 80% increase over Q4 2022. This boost exceeds the norm for the industry and signifies that SoundHound can take market share and develop its top-line AI products.\n\nThe revenue for 2023 was $45.9 million, a\u00a047% increase over 2022. This year\u2019s growth demonstrates the heavy demand for SoundHound\u2019s offerings across a range of industries. The growth context from 2022 to 2023 shows how well SoundHound has been fundamentally able to grow its business and take advantage of market possibilities.\n\nMoreover, SoundHound has a solid revenue projection for 2024 and 2025. The company has set a midpoint target of $70 million and anticipates sales for 2024 to range from $63 to $77 million. Thus, SoundHound is efficient in its ability to hit a bigger top-line and maintain its prevailing growth trajectory.\n\nLastly, the 2025 projection suggests a top-line pass of $100 million. In short, this highlights SoundHound\u2019s potential for long-term growth and its dedication to ongoing growth and market lead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in Palo Alto (PANW) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Palo Alto Networks (PANW).\n\nPalo Alto currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 41 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 41 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 27 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.9% and 4.9% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Palo Alto here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Palo Alto, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs PANW Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Palo Alto, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.49.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Palo Alto.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Blink Charging (BLNK) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.22 a share 29 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 14, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the -$0.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the -$0.27 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Blink Charging has an Earnings ESP of 19.27%.\n\nBLNK is just one of a large group of Computer and Technology stocks with a positive ESP figure. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, which is readying to report earnings on May 28, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.26 a share, and PANW is 43 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nFor Palo Alto Networks, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 is 0.34%.\n\nBLNK and PANW's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Finding opportunities that have the potential to provide large profits is crucial. Three tech companies have emerged as strong competitors with promising futures in the tech sector. These businesses have drawn notice for their strategic initiatives that set them up for future growth, market dominance and strong financial results.\n\nThe first one stands out for its outstanding financial results, showcasing significant gross merchandise value (GMV) gains and a growing user base. This illustrates its ability to draw in and keep buyers and sellers, which results in increased transaction amounts and earnings.\n\nLikewise, the latter is notable for its remarkable rise in Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), which indicates robust revenue visibility and the capacity to win long-term customer commitments. Investors will feel more confident about the company\u2019s stability and potential revenue streams.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe third, meanwhile, has invested in state-of-the-art AI-driven product suites that improve campaign performance and customer experience, marking a major advancement in innovation.\n\nThese three businesses offer a combination of sound financial standing, promising markets and astute strategic planning.\n\nGigaCloud (GCT) e-commerce stocks, Image of small shopping bags sitting in a shopping cart on a computer. Strong Buy E-Commerce Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGigaCloud (NASDAQ:GCT) has shown impressive financial results. For instance, over the 12 months (ended 2023), GigaCloud Marketplace GMV climbed by 53.3% year-over-year (YoY). Active 3P buyers jumped by 20.5% to 5,010, while active sellers expanded by 45.5% YoY to 815. At $158,569, the spend per active customer increased by 27.2% YoY. These operational KPIs show how well GigaCloud can draw in and keep buyers and sellers, which increases transaction volumes and earnings.\n\nComparably, net income increased for the entire year from $24.0 million in 2022 to\u00a0$94.1 million in 2023, and the net income margin increased from 4.9% to 13.4%. GigaCloud\u2019s capacity to effectively turn revenues into profits, as seen by the notable net income and margin growth, demonstrates solid operational performance and successful cost-control strategies.\n\nMoreover, through the acquisitions of\u00a0Noble House and Wondersign, GigaCloud has proactively increased its product line scope, market penetration, and technological prowess. In short, incorporating Wondersign improves GigaCloud\u2019s digital signage and customer-facing solutions. Lastly, the acquisition of Noble House has expanded warehouse capacity, product SKUs and supplier networks.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nThe RPO of Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) increased to $10.8 billion in Q2 fiscal 2024, representing 22% annual growth. The notable increase in RPO indicates a sizable backlog of contracted revenue, which leads to potential stable revenue streams. Palo Alto\u2019s ability to obtain long-term customer commitments and preserve solid customer relationships is reflected in its backlog. With a rising RPO, Palo Alto Networks has improved revenue visibility and predictability.\n\nThanks to this visibility, the company can more accurately project future financial performance, allocate resources and make well-informed strategic decisions. Additionally, Palo Alto\u2019s financial estimates for 2024 signify solid revenue, billings and EPS growth projections. Total billings of between $10.10 billion and $10.20 billion are projected, indicating an increase of\u00a010% to 11% YoY.\n\nPANW\u2019s estimated top-line in 2024 stands between\u00a0$7.95 billion to $8 billion, growing between 15% and 16% annually. Similarly, the forecasted non-GAAP operating margin falls between 26.5% and 27.0%, and the projected diluted non-GAAP net income per share is between $5.45 and $5.55. To conclude, the outlook strongly emphasizes approaching growth and profitability in a balanced manner, with goals for increased revenue and improved margins.\n\nViant (DSP) graphic of laptop screens displaying ad space\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nViant (NASDAQ:DSP) has made considerable investments in creating cutting-edge product suites that use AI and machine learning to improve the customer experience and boost campaign performance. Examples of these suites are AI Bid Optimizer and the Viant Data platform. The AI Bid Optimizer has garnered significant traction among clients. This enables them to realize an average of 35% cost per mile (CPM) savings.\n\nMoreover, Viant intends to introduce a\u00a0second-generation optimizer, which should result in even greater cost savings. The Viant Data platform, which activates first-party data without depending on cookies, has observed good early adoption rates. This has led to higher spending on the platform and outsized campaign results, especially among top customers.\n\nFurthermore, among the four enterprise-grade self-service demand-side platforms available in the market, Viant is\u00a0one of the only two that is buy-side solely, indicating that it is not involved in representing any publisher inventory. In summary, advertisers have responded favorably to the company\u2019s focus on providing mid-market companies with a more data-driven platform.\n\nFinally, the platform provides superior results and support compared to platforms tailored to substantial international brands\u2019 needs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Since 2004, which was their IPO year, GOOG stock has been attractive. Due to its constant stock splits, a $100 investment back in the year would be valued at $1.2 million now.\n\nDespite its strong position in search, cloud, and YouTube, Alphabet\u2019s stock trades at a low valuation, with a forward price-earnings ratio of 22.5-times and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.5-times, considering its substantial net cash. The company\u2019s underrated AI initiatives, particularly in cloud services, contribute to its long-term appeal, aiding deal expansion.\n\nWhile Alphabet may yield different returns than in its early years, it remains a solid investment for potential millionaires.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArm-Based AI Chip\n\nAt Alphabet\u2019s cloud computing event, partnerships and products showcased the potential for Google\u2019s stock.

While Google Cloud recently turned profitable, its scale is crucial due to significant fixed costs. YouTube, another critical sector, saw an 8% revenue increase to $31.5 billion, with its premium services boasting over 100 million subscribers and contributing $15 billion.\n\nThough there are concerns about AI disrupting Google\u2019s search dominance, the potential for AI to monetize non-advertised searches presents a significant opportunity for Alphabet\u2019s future growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Consequently, it saw a massive jump in price due to its impressive revenue and EPS growth. Zscaler reported revenue growth of 48% and tacked on an extra 100 million dollars in cash flows from operations compared to 2022.\n\nAlready, ZS is starting 2024 with a similar revenue trajectory as it continues to reduce operational costs. While cybersecurity faces slower growth, Zscaler stands out with an optimistic outlook.\n\nFurther, Zscaler reports an outlook of continued year-over-year (YOY) revenue buildup and a hopeful non-GAAP net income per share of $2.73 to $2.77. Despite high-cost research and development to adopt new zero-trust solutions, Zscaler expects a growing operating margin and better returns this year.\n\nThus, the company is slowly but surely reaching the GAAP profitable threshold.

Of course, that number includes folks who were part of more than just one cyber incident.\n\nWorse, \u201cAlmost three-quarters, or 73%, of board members at companies with over 5,000 employees fear their organization is at risk of a major cyberattack within the next year, a survey commissioned by Proofpoint in 12 countries showed,\u201d\u00a0as noted by CyberNews.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cCritical infrastructure in the U.S. contains industrial control systems that are known to be easy targets for cyber attackers,\u201d\u00a0added TheHill.com. Even more ridiculous, the federal U.S. government has been viciously attacked because of unpreparedness. One of the most advanced countries in the world isn\u2019t ready. Can you believe that?\n\nWe\u2019ve known about these threats for years, and we\u2019re still unprepared. The only good thing about that is that it\u2019s been fueling upside in cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOver the last few weeks, shares of\u00a0SentinelOne (NYSE:S) gapped lower on earnings.\n\nSure, the company\u2019s earnings per share loss of 2 cents beat by 2 cents. And revenue of $174.2 million \u2014 up 38.2% year over year \u2014 beat by $4.83 million.\n\nUnfortunately, not all numbers were seen as favorable. Annual recurring revenue, for example, came in at $724 million, which was below estimates. It also posted\u00a0new annual recurring revenue of $61 million, which was also below estimates. Revenue guidance of $181 million also came in below estimates.\n\nHowever, I\u2019d use the recent weakness as an opportunity. It\u2019s oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams\u2019 %R, and currently consolidating at around $22.55. From here, I\u2019d like to see it refill its bearish gap at around $27 initially.\n\nBank of America has a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $35.\u00a0The firm added, \u201cWe remain positive on SentinelOne\u2019s competitive positioning and its near-term pathway to profitability and [free cash flow] generation.\u201d\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy is\u00a0Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). After plunging from about $370 to a recent low of $265 on cut guidance, it\u2019s showing signs of life.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust weeks ago, the company reduced its full-year revenue guidance to a new range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion from $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion. It also cut its full-year billings outlook to a new range of\u00a0$10.1 billion to $10.2 billion, from $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. However, it looks like most of that mess has been priced into the stock.\n\nNow trading at $278.87, I\u2019d like to see PANW initially retest resistance at $330. With patience, I\u2019d also like to see it refill its bearish gap at around $330 a share.\n\nAnalysts at Argus just reiterated a buy on the stock, with a price target of $336.\u00a0\u201cIf we thought there was any deterioration in the demand environment for cybersecurity software or there was some competitive or execution issue, we might agree with the market,\u201d\u00a0said Argus\u2019 Joseph Bonner, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\n\u201cHowever, the cybersecurity environment is, if anything, getting more toxic as generative AI may be used for both good and ill.\u201d\n\nPlus, CEO Nikesh Arora is confident that demand for cybersecurity remains robust.\n\nAmplify Cybersecurity ETF (HACK) Illustration of hacker with Ethereum\n\nSource: Sergey Nivens/Shutterstock.com\n\nOr, we can diversify at a low cost with the\u00a0Amplify Cybersecurity ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.60%, the HACK ETF holds 24 cybersecurity stocks, including Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) and Gen Digital (NASDAQ:GEN) to name a few.\n\nSince launching in 2014, the HACK ETF portfolio includes a portfolio of companies actively involved in providing cybersecurity solutions that include hardware, software and services. All of which should thrive from the growing global cyber threats.\n\nAs pointed out by AmplifyETFs.com, \u201cIn 2023, the global cybersecurity market reached $236.75 billion, and is projected to grow to $506.79 billion by 2032.\u00a0Defense Spending on Cybersecurity Is Growing Significantly: The overall DoD (Department of Defense) proposed budget grew 3.2% for 2024 vs 2023 while Cyber spending (as part of that request) grew more than 15%.\u201d\n\nAfter bottoming out at around $50 late last year, the HACK ETF is now consolidating at around $63.83.

        "content": "The threat of cyber crimes is on the rise, making cybersecurity stocks one of the biggest investment trends for the next decade. Demand for robust cybersecurity solutions continues to grow exponentially.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey and Company, the total addressable market for cybersecurity could amount to approximately $2 trillion. They estimate that it could be worth approximately 10X the vended market, and continued innovation in the sector will drive market penetration. Additionally, generative AI will be a huge growth tailwind for cybersecurity in threat detection and cloud security. With this backdrop, the cybersecurity sector presents investors with ample opportunity for explosive gains.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top cybersecurity stocks to buy for 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) has established itself as the largest cybersecurity company by market capitalization. They are a dominant force in the cybersecurity sector, particularly known for their next-generation firewalls.\n\nPalo Alto Networks firewalls go beyond traditional packet filtering, offering advanced threat prevention, application security, and URL filtering capabilities. The company holds a comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity products to address a wide range of threats. This includes advanced persistent threats (APT), malware, ransomware, and data breaches. Furthermore, they have been actively expanding their partnerships, most recently, with Nvidia and other 5G providers to advanced private 5G security solutions. As revenue growth, profitability, and FCF continues to accelerate, PANW stock remains one of the top cybersecurity stocks for explosive gains.\n\nCheck Point Software (CHKP) Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy: Check Point Software (CHKP)\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nCheck Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) is a cybersecurity veteran with a proven track record of innovation and growth. The company offers a broad range of cybersecurity solutions, including firewalls, threat detection, end-point, and cloud security solutions.\n\nCheck Point boasts a loyal customer base, with a large percentage of recurring revenue from existing customers. They are investing heavily in the AI-powered cloud security race, with their XD Horizon XDR/HD platform. This platform will provide significant long term revenue growth opportunities, as they look to be the leader in threat prevention and detection. In FY23, Check Point\u2019s revenue growth was not too impressive. However, they managed to grow EPS 12% YOY to $7.10 per share while generating $1 billion in FCF from operations. Moreover, they recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to secure AI cloud infrastructure. With global cybersecurity and risk management spending on the rise, Check Point\u2019s strong operating margins make it well positioned to accelerate profitability over the next decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is undoubtedly one of the best cybersecurity stocks to snap up in 2024. They offer a wide array of cybersecurity solutions from intrusion prevention systems and endpoint security to secure access service edge (SASE) offerings.\n\nFortinet stock has been a rocketship over the last several years. This is largely attributed to their accelerated revenue growth and profitability. FTNT stock has risen 269% over the last 5 years, as compared to the S&P 500 79% over the same period. The company\u2019s gross billing volume has been growing exponentially as their flagship Fortigate firewall drove demand. In the 2023 fiscal year, their profitability increased substantially with EPS up 42% YOY to $1.46 per share. Furthermore, FCF swelled to $1.73 billion and net earnings eclipsed $1 billion for the first time. If you\u2019re looking for a leader in the cybersecurity space, then look no further than this transformative company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Consider Adding to Your Retirement Portfolio in April",
        "content": "The overall market may look and feel overvalued right now. But let's be real -- you can still find compelling individual stock prospects.\n\nThings change a bit, however, when you're talking about new picks for a retirement account. You can only contribute so much money to these vehicles in any given year, and there's no tax benefit when you suffer a trading loss within an IRA. That's why you'll want to be more conservative with your retirement fund's investments, maximizing growth while minimizing risk.\n\nHere are three stocks that are better suited than most for a retirement portfolio. The key common thread for all three underlying companies is certainty.\n\nPhilip Morris International\n\nThe worldwide smoking-cessation movement is getting traction. But it's not getting nearly as much traction as you might think. The World Health Organization predicts that the worldwide number of smokers will only dwindle from 2015's 1.32 billion to 1.27 billion by 2025, underscoring how little progress is being made on the front. Population growth isn't helping either.\n\nNevertheless, the world's tobacco powerhouses see the writing on the wall, even if it won't be a real problem for decades. They're managing the slow demise of traditional cigarettes by introducing alternatives like vaping and heated tobacco products. Philip Morris International(NYSE: PM) is arguably leading this charge.\n\nPhilip Morris is, of course, the owner of its namesake brand of cigarettes (at least outside of the United States -- Altria's Philip Morris USA handles the brand within the U.S.). But it's also parent to familiar brands like Marlboro and others when those cigarettes are sold overseas.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Philip Morris International is the name behind heated-tobacco product IQOS, which is now the company's best-selling brand of... well, anything. As of its fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, smoke-free products account for nearly 40% of the company's top and bottom lines. IQOS is leading the way with 28.6 million users, up 3.7 million versus 2022's year-end count.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's still no absolute permanency to this new, budding business that's displacing cigarettes. Inhaling anything other than air will always mean some degree of risk.\n\nThese are moves that could prolong the lives of tobacco giants for decades, though, supporting their incredible dividend payouts for just as long. Newcomers to Philip Morris International will be plugging into the stock while its dividend yield stands at 5.6%. This number's based on a dividend that's now been raised for 16 consecutive years.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nHow does the old saying go? Expect it when you least expect it?\n\nThat's probably how plenty of people are feeling right now. It's been a while since we've heard about a major data breach. Then, pow! AT&T recently announced that personal information for tens of millions of past and current customers was found online, freely available to anyone who knew how and where to look.\n\nIt's a not-so-gentle reminder that as long as computers, networks, data centers, and the internet exist, there will always be cybercriminals. That's why we'll always need cybersecurity solutions. And that's why the cybersecurity software industry will likely grow at a double-digit pace every year for the next several years. Indeed, the business will arguably never stop growing.\n\nEnter Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW).\n\nPalo Alto is a cybersecurity outfit. It's one of the biggest, in fact, doing $7.5 billion worth of business last year alone. Analysts expect the current fiscal year's revenue to roll in nearly 16% better than last year's, extending a long-standing pace that's also expected to extend into the next several years. Per-share earnings have been growing at a similar clip, and are also expected to carry on. PANW Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.\n\nThis consistency ultimately reflects the strength of Palo Alto Network's offerings, and how they're made available to customers.\n\nSee, Palo Alto isn't just firewalls and antivirus software. It offers a wide range of integrated services ranging from remote-worker login credentials to malware detection to cloud protection -- and more -- all managed from a simple cloud-based interface. Access to its tools is also subscription-based, meaning much of its revenue is recurring. It's also reliable, as switching cybersecurity services providers can be complicated.\n\nThe strength of its business model hasn't prevented Palo Alto shares from falling nearly 30% since February. But such setbacks from this stock are unusual and usually short-lived, meaning this dip is a buying opportunity.\n\nNu Holdings\n\nLast but not least, think about adding Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU) to your retirement portfolio before April comes to a close.\n\nIt's not a household name... at least not where you likely live. If you live in South America, though, things might be different. The fintech company offers a handful of credit and debit cards, along with mobile wallet services, to 94 million customers in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. For nearly one-third of its most active users, Nu serves as their primary bank.\n\nIt's not an uncrowded arena. MercadoLibre and StoneCo are offering similar services in many of the same markets. This is one of those cases, however, where there's more than enough business growth to go around.\n\nIn many ways, South America's e-commerce industry is where North America's was a little over 20 years ago. Americas Market Intelligence believes Latin America's e-commerce market is set to grow to the tune of 24% this year, followed by 21% growth next year and in 2026.\n\nAt the same time, smartphone adoption in the region is heating up again following a pandemic-prompted lull. Research outfit Canalys reports smartphone shipments in Latin America grew 20% year over year to 31.5 million units during the final quarter of last year. Even so, GSMA says only 74% of the continent's population will be mobile subscribers by 2025, and slightly fewer still will be regular mobile internet users by then.\n\nMoreover, much of South America is becoming \"mobile first,\" meaning mobile phones are the primary way its residents connect to the internet.\n\nConnect the dots. Nu Holdings is already occupying the space where most people are going. This year's projected top-line growth of 38% is sustainable for the next several years. The company's also profitable, underscoring the bullish argument.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Philip Morris International right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Philip Morris International wasn\u2019t one of them.

Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing rising cybersecurity risks. Businesses are accelerating adoption of cloud-based software, moving data and applications into the cloud to save costs while improving performance.

        "content": "Friday, April 5, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of T-Mobile US have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+9.3% vs. +5.3%). The company is witnessing top line expansion backed by industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate.\r\n\r\nDeclining operating expenses are boosting the operating margin. Its Ultra Capacity 5G delivers superfast speeds, powering 5G smartphones and enabling innovators to deliver transformational 5G experiences. During the fourth quarter, T-Mobile added 1.6 million postpaid net customers, while postpaid net account additions were a staggering 299,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, the highly competitive and saturated U.S. telecom market lowers its growth potential. Promotional offers and low-priced service plans to expand the customer base are putting pressure on its profitability. The residual value of the surrendered phones, which the companies look to sell in other markets, may induce liquidity risk if the plan falls apart.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on T-Mobile US here >>>)\r\n\r\nAbbott Laboratories\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+7.8% vs. +3.8%). The company\u2019s pipeline is generating several new growth prospects, which will help sustain the positive momentum and contribute to the strong growth projection in 2024.\r\n\r\nAlinity, the company\u2019s next-generation suite of systems, is a key driver in the core lab diagnostics business. EPD's impressive stretch of strong performance stems from the company\u2019s unique business model. Freestyle Libre CGM device is also on a great trajectory, continually outpacing market growth.\r\n\r\nWithin Nutrition, after a period of hiccups, Abbott has finally reestablished itself as the market leader in the infant formula business, underscoring strong customer confidence in the company's products. However, the slump in COVID-19 testing-related sales is hurting Abbott\u2019s overall growth. Tough macro conditions also pose a concern for its operations.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Abbott Laboratories here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Palo Alto Networks have gained +36.6% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s gain of +63.3%. The company\u2019s softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Palo Alto has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD), The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) and Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "7 Nancy Pelosi Stocks Still Worth Buying in Q2",
        "content": "In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let\u2019s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you\u2019re going to disagree with that last point. That\u2019s okay. The point is you can\u2019t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress.\n\nWell, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Let\u2019s move on \u2013 below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it\u2019s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.\n\nFundamentally, it\u2019s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What\u2019s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it\u2019s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50. That\u2019s a significant increase over last year\u2019s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that\u2019s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023\u2019s $6.89 billion tally. It\u2019s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nConsumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there\u2019s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there\u2019s also a solid chance you\u2019re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy.\n\nYes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That\u2019s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can\u2019t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don\u2019t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That\u2019s a decent bump from last year\u2019s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we\u2019re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year\u2019s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I\u2019m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft\u2019s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to.\n\nYes, the spotlight centers on the company\u2019s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It\u2019s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year\u2019s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we\u2019re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year\u2019s haul of $211.91 billion.\n\nI think it\u2019s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE:AXP). Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I think it\u2019s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I\u2019m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.\n\nLet\u2019s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies, AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It\u2019s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts\u2019 EPS targets.\n\nLooking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That\u2019s up noticeably from last year\u2019s print of $11.21. For revenue, we\u2019re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023\u2019s tally of $60.52 billion.\n\nDisney (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nTo start, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It\u2019s understandable. While the entertainment giant \u2013 which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts \u2013 commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year\u2019s revenue. Nevertheless, it\u2019s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nIn Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts\u2019 EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That\u2019s earnings growth if I\u2019ve ever seen it.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year\u2019s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it\u2019s a solid wager.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nThe former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it\u2019s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had.\n\nOne of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it\u2019s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet\u2019s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn\u2019t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That\u2019s a big jump from last year\u2019s print of $5.80. Also, they\u2019re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we\u2019re talking a large gap from last year\u2019s result of $307.39 billion.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we come to the riskiest idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks, financial technology (fintech) stalwart PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). It\u2019s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I\u2019d say it\u2019s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it\u2019s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that\u2019s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.\n\nStill, I\u2019m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It\u2019s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That\u2019s a bit disappointing compared to last year\u2019s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year\u2019s tally of $29.77 billion. It\u2019s worth looking into if you\u2019re a contrarian.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this security software maker have returned -6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palo Alto falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share, indicating a change of +14.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +23.7%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8 billion and $9.17 billion estimates indicate +16.1% and +14.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.22%. The EPS surprise was +12.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In fact, there are some that are in the red year-to-date, including some former high-fliers.\n\nThe market is ignoring these stocks. They\u2019ve gone on sale. But are they a value or are they a trap?\n\nHow to Tell if a Stock is a Value, or a Trap\n\nRemember, the key to telling if a stock is a true value, or if it\u2019s a trap, is to check out the analyst earnings estimates. Is the full year consensus expected to fall year-over-year? Is the earnings growth slowing?\n\nThat usually indicates there is something going on in the business which then can translate over to the stock price.\n\nA true value will still have rising earnings growth for this year and next.\n\nFinding Value in Fallen Growth Stocks\n\nNot all value stocks are classic values with low P/E, P/B, P/S or PEG ratios. Some stocks may be values because they are trading at a discount to their industry peers or because a plunge in the shares has made the company historically cheap.\n\nThis week, Tracey looks at 5 stocks that have fallen from their former glory. They are on \u201csale\u201d. But are they a true deal?\n\nStory continues\n\n5 Growth Stocks That are on Sale\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW\n\nPalo Alto Networks is one of the popular cybersecurity stocks. But after its last earnings report, the shares dropped sharply. Year-to-date, shares of Palo Alto Networks are down 4.3%.\n\nEarnings are expected to grow 23.6% this year while sales rise another 16%. Palo Alto Networks still trades with a forward P/E of 52, even as the shares have pulled back.\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks a value or a trap?\n\n2. Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU\n\nLululemon is a specialty retailer famous for its popular yoga pants. Shares plunged 17% over the last month after the company guided for next year earnings below the Zacks Consensus.\n\nEarnings of Lululemon are still expected to rise 10.8% this year on sales growth of 12%. It has gotten cheaper on a P/E basis since the sell-off. Lululemon now trades at 27x forward earnings.\n\nIs Lululemon a value or a trap?\n\n3. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\n\nEV sales are down and so are the shares of Tesla in 2024. Tesla shares have fallen 28.8% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts are bearish on Tesla. In just the last week, one estimate has been cut for this year. Earnings are expected to fall 2.2% this year.\n\nShares aren\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis at 59. But Tesla investors have never cared about the P/E.\n\nIs Tesla a value or a trap?\n\n4. Nike Inc. NKE\n\nNike shares recently plunged after the company reported its fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings. Nike is down 10.5% over the last month and over the last year, is down 23.3%.\n\nAnalysts have been adjusting their earnings estimates over the last week. 8 are higher for fiscal 2024. Nike\u2019s earnings are expected to rise 15.2% this year. But 9 estimates have been cut for fiscal 2025 as well.\n\nNike trades with a forward P/E of 25. It pays a dividend yielding 1.6%.\n\nIs Nike a value or a trap after the sell-off?\n\n5. Starbucks Corp. SBUX\n\nStarbucks shares have been under the weather for the last year. They\u2019ve been ignored by the Street. Starbucks shares recently traded near 52-week lows, down 7.1% during that time.\n\nEarnings of Starbucks are expected to rise 14.7% in fiscal 2024 on sales growth of 7.8%. Starbucks trades with a forward P/E of 22.5.\n\nIs Starbucks a value or is it a trap?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Stocks on Sale?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of LULU and SBUX in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 biggest software companies in the US. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the software industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Software Companies in the US.\n\nAn Overview of the Global Software Industry\n\nThe software industry has become an integral part of our modern world. It creates the programs that run our computers and devices, from smartphones to complex medical equipment. The software market plays a crucial role in countless industries, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation. The software market has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global software market was estimated to have reached a value of $583.47 billion in 2022. The software market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5% from 2023 to 2030 to reach a value of $1.39 trillion by the end of the forecast period. In 2022, the North American region dominated the market.\n\nThe rapid development of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and blockchain is enabling new software solutions and driving market growth. Businesses across all sectors are increasingly reliant on digital tools and processes to operate efficiently. This is leading to an increase in investments in software solutions that automate tasks, manage data, and facilitate communication. Moreover, the amount of data generated globally is continuously rising and the software industry plays a key role in storing, analyzing, and extracting insights from this data. The demand for cloud-based software solutions is expected to significantly surge in the coming years. The shift towards cloud-based software offers several advantages, including scalability, affordability, and easier access.\n\nThe Biggest Names in the Software Industry\n\nSoftware companies are at the forefront of innovation, developing solutions that enhance productivity, streamline processes, and revolutionize the way we interact with technology. Some of the most prominent names in the industry are Salesforce Inc.

        "content": "(0:30) - Finding Popular Stocks That Are On Sale (6:45) - Tracey\u2019s Top Stock Picks: Creating A Strong Watch List (29:10) - Episode Roundup: PANW, LULU, TSLA, NKE, SBUX Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #363 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 continues to hit new all-time highs, not every stock has been soaring in 2024. In fact, there are some that are in the red year-to-date, including some former high-fliers.\n\nThe market is ignoring these stocks. They\u2019ve gone on sale. But are they a value or are they a trap?\n\nHow to Tell if a Stock is a Value, or a Trap\n\nRemember, the key to telling if a stock is a true value, or if it\u2019s a trap, is to check out the analyst earnings estimates. Is the full year consensus expected to fall year-over-year? Is the earnings growth slowing?\n\nThat usually indicates there is something going on in the business which then can translate over to the stock price.\n\nA true value will still have rising earnings growth for this year and next.\n\nFinding Value in Fallen Growth Stocks\n\nNot all value stocks are classic values with low P/E, P/B, P/S or PEG ratios. Some stocks may be values because they are trading at a discount to their industry peers or because a plunge in the shares has made the company historically cheap.\n\nThis week, Tracey looks at 5 stocks that have fallen from their former glory. They are on \u201csale\u201d. But are they a true deal?\n\n5 Growth Stocks That are on Sale\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW)\n\nPalo Alto Networks is one of the popular cybersecurity stocks. But after its last earnings report, the shares dropped sharply. Year-to-date, shares of Palo Alto Networks are down 4.3%.\n\nEarnings are expected to grow 23.6% this year while sales rise another 16%. Palo Alto Networks still trades with a forward P/E of 52, even as the shares have pulled back.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks a value or a trap?\n\n2. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)\n\nLululemon is a specialty retailer famous for its popular yoga pants. Shares plunged 17% over the last month after the company guided for next year earnings below the Zacks Consensus.\n\nEarnings of Lululemon are still expected to rise 10.8% this year on sales growth of 12%. It has gotten cheaper on a P/E basis since the sell-off. Lululemon now trades at 27x forward earnings.\n\nIs Lululemon a value or a trap?\n\n3. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)\n\nEV sales are down and so are the shares of Tesla in 2024. Tesla shares have fallen 28.8% year-to-date.\n\nAnalysts are bearish on Tesla. In just the last week, one estimate has been cut for this year. Earnings are expected to fall 2.2% this year.\n\nShares aren\u2019t cheap on a P/E basis at 59. But Tesla investors have never cared about the P/E.\n\nIs Tesla a value or a trap?\n\n4. Nike Inc. (NKE)\n\nNike shares recently plunged after the company reported its fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings. Nike is down 10.5% over the last month and over the last year, is down 23.3%.\n\nAnalysts have been adjusting their earnings estimates over the last week. 8 are higher for fiscal 2024. Nike\u2019s earnings are expected to rise 15.2% this year. But 9 estimates have been cut for fiscal 2025 as well.\n\nNike trades with a forward P/E of 25. It pays a dividend yielding 1.6%.\n\nIs Nike a value or a trap after the sell-off?\n\n5. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)\n\nStarbucks shares have been under the weather for the last year. They\u2019ve been ignored by the Street. Starbucks shares recently traded near 52-week lows, down 7.1% during that time.\n\nEarnings of Starbucks are expected to rise 14.7% in fiscal 2024 on sales growth of 7.8%. Starbucks trades with a forward P/E of 22.5.\n\nIs Starbucks a value or is it a trap?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Stocks on Sale?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of LULU and SBUX in her personal portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zscaler Is Attractively Valued Amid Growing Digital Reliance",
        "content": "Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has one of the highest growth rates in its industry, based on my analysis of dominant peers. As such, I consider it a significant investment in artificieal intelligecne-integrated cybersecurity, with a particular moat in how it protects cloud operations. However, fast-changing digital landscapes, as they relate to the increased abilities of AI, could pose significant risks for shareholders. This needs to be monitored carefully.\n\nOverview of operations\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ZS.\n\nFounded in 2007, the company describes itself as the world's largest any-to-any security cloud platform. Its most valuable operational asset at this time is the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, which is a cybersecurity suite that operates under the fundamental tenet of trusting no one and verifying everything. This model treats all users and devices as potential threats, whether they are inside or outside of a network. The platform is cloud-native, meaning it is built and run on the cloud, which facilitates better scalability, performance and security.\n\nI believe this technology is particularly important at a time when work environments are becoming increasingly hybridized, with some organizations opting for fully remote working conditions. Increased cybersecurity as a result of the high load of digital transactions of often sensitive data requires advanced systems of protection against data extraction, malware and other corruption of digital workflows.\n\nZscaler has countless technology partners, including Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Slack (WORK). For example, with Microsoft, Szcaler is integrated into Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft 365 Defender. With Amazon Web Services, the integration of Zscaler improves the security of digital transformation, most significantly for organizations leveraging its cloud infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetition\n\nOf Zscaler's competitors, and there are many, a few notable ones stand out to me as being potentially the biggest threats:\n\nPalo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW): I consider it to be the most significant competitor as the company has a wide range of security solutions, including advanced firewalls and cloud-based offerings. Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO): The most well-financed peer, the company has an extensive range of security products, such as firewalls, VPNs and advanced malware protection. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT): The company covers everything from firewalls to secure SD-WAN, which manages traffic across wide area networks for higher efficiency.\n\nIt is useful for us to put these four peers into proper perspective based on some of the core financial metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet IPO 2018 2012 1990 2009 Market Cap $29.22 B $92.71 B $201.53 B $52.1 B Equity-to-Asset 0.24 0.24 0.46 -0.06 Net Margin -7.32% 30.24% 23.49% 21.64% 3Y Rev Growth Rate 49.6% 19.8% 6.2% 29.6% FWD PE Ratio 82 56 13.4 40\n\nIt is quite evident to me that Zscaler has particular appeal compared to some of the newer players, namely Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, as it shows higher growth. I believe, as is the case with most excellent companies that last over the long term, it will manage to stabilize its profitability. This is already somewhat evident in that its median net margin over the past 10 years is -26.69%, but, over time, it has reined this in to -7.32%.\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks looks like a compelling alternative investment, Zscaler is more attractive by and large, in my opinion. Palo Alto Networks has a strong acquisition strategy, including CloudGenix in 2020 and Twistlock in 2019, and a diverse product portfolio, including its Prisma cloud and Cortex AI security platform. But Zscaler's portfolio looks stronger and it has also made multiple high-status acquisitions, bolstering its five key areas of operation that act as a simple framework for enterprise partnerships. Among these are:\n\nZscaler Internet Access: Efficient in secure internet and SaaS application access, replacing traditional VPN and firewall technology. Zscaler Private Access: Access to private applications securely, without a VPN, without bringing users onto the internet. Zscaler Cloud Protection: Provides security for public cloud environments. Zscaler Digital Experience: A comprehensive monitoring solution that ensures optimal user experience of Zscaler tools while also optimizing security.\n\nIn short, Zscaler offers a one-point solution with some of the most advanced technology on the market, which I think outperforms Palo Alto Networks, Cisco and Fortinet operationally in many areas, specifically as it relates to cloud security and simplicity in these operations.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nZscaler's growth is hinged on the widely anticipated expansion of the broader digital services market, particularly the managed services market, which includes managed data centers, security, network and infrastructure services. Mordor Intelligence estimates this will grow at a compound annual rate of 7.90% from 2024 to 2029. It attributes factors such as an increasing shift to hybrid IT, improved cost and operational efficiency demand and rising IT complexity as core drivers of this market growth. My own opinion is that the market as it relates to Zscaler will grow faster than this, even more so than Mordor's estimate of an 11.44% CAGR for the cybersecurity market from 2024 to 2029. My own estimate is around a 15% CAGR over the next decade, as my belief is the adoption of cloud services, hybrid and remote working and demand for advanced digital services and associated security will increase exponentially as AI proliferates the mainstream more readily, driving new business models that are more operationally digital due to cost-effectiveness, a higher amount of self-employed and independent contractors and a lower reliance on human labor in general as functions become more reliably automated.\n\nThis is a very interesting time to be in the job market, as I believe we are going to see faster change than we ever have in history, and people will have to be quick to react to shifting labor demands. That being said, one constant seems to ring true, which is that most, if not all, of these labor demands will be significantly dependent on digital workflows and associated data protection and security, which will be highly beneficial for companies like Zscaler.\n\nValuation\n\nSuccessfully valuing Zscaler based on earnings is difficult because of how early on it is in its development. As this is the case, I have opted to analyzes its price-to-free cash flow ratio relative to peers instead. I have also looked at the company's price-to-operating cash flow ratio against peers for the same reason. First of all, consider each of the four peers compared based on the two valuation metrics:\n\nZscaler Palo Alto Networks Cisco Fortinet P/FCF 57 34.5 15 31 P/OCF 44 33 14 28\n\nZscaler is quite clearly the highest valued of the four, but investors should consider that its valuation has come down considerably in the last few years. Its median price-to-free cash flow ratio over the past 10 years is 221.75, indicating a 74.10% discount from the historical valuation. Additionally, its price-to-operating cash flow median over the past 10 years is 132.90, indicating a 66.60% discount from the historical valuation.\n\nConsidering analysts expect, on consensus, an earnings per share without non-recurring items CAGR of 31.17% over the next three years, I believe the present valuation shows a significantly strong price and an attractive entry point despite trading at a premium to the three peers. We must remember that Palo Alto Networks has a much lower forecasted CAGR over the next three years of 17.05%, hence the lower premium in the valuation attributed by the market.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is evidently a risk that Zscaler will be outcompeted by other cybersecurity companies that develop, and it appears that there is not a concentrated monopoly in cybersecurity at this time. As such, there is, in some sense, an arms race toward that monopoly in AI-led cybersecurity, similar to how Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have a duopoly in software and hardware. Zscaler investors should watch the market carefully, as there may come a time in the not-too-distant future when it makes sense to sell the stake for another provider if it becomes clear the balance of power has begun to shift.\n\nAdditionally, along similar lines, as AI becomes more powerful and we reach unprecedented capabilities, it is quite possible the cybersecurity and digital landscapes shift considerably. What is now cutting-edge, the cloud, could in the future become outdated and Zscaler has an enormous task at hand in keeping up to date with the rapid shifts that are likely to happen in the AI and associated cybersecurity industries. The company has a large ecosystem with partners and connections in the industry that provide it with some moat in this regard in terms of operational collaboration and financing capabilities, but investors must be aware of the risk of rapid change.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom my research, I believe Zscaler to be one of the best investments in cybersecurity currently, but the markets are shifting quickly. Nonetheless, I believe now is a prudent time to consider the stock due to the favorable valuation and high growth expected by analysts. My research into market drivers bodes very well for the company's long-term future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. ASML (ASML) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.95 a share 22 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 17, 2024.\n\nASML's Earnings ESP sits at 3.42%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.95 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.85.\n\nASML is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Palo Alto Networks (PANW) as well.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 28, 2024. PANW's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.26 a share 63 days from its next earnings release.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Palo Alto Networks is $1.26, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.34%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, ASML and PANW could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "Cybersecurity plays an ever-increasing role in our daily lives. Sure, the latest PC you bought or the application you downloaded adds a lot of joy to your life. However, lurking in the shadows are bad guys trying to tap into your privacy.\n\nSo, a surge in cybercrime prompts a rise in cybersecurity. The industry is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of\u00a011.44% until 2029, presenting secular growth opportunities.\n\nAmong numerous industry constituents, three best-in-class cybersecurity stocks stand out. Each asset hosts solid fundamentals and aligned quantitative metrics. So, let\u2019s delve into the three best cybersecurity picks to buy this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike Holdings (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an integrated cybersecurity company primarily offering cloud workload and endpoint, threat intelligence, and cyberattack response. Unlike most cyber companies, Crowdstrike provides affordable products and services, allowing succinct customer switching. The firm\u2019s high-quality, fair-cost model has led to secular growth which looks set to continue.\n\nThe company\u2019s latest earnings report illustrated the aforementioned. Crowdstrike\u2019s fourth-quarter report communicated annual recurring revenue of $3.44 billion, a 34.4% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Furthermore, CRWD retained an 80% subscription gross profit margin, suggesting economies of scale are en route.\n\nApproximately 94.16% of the company\u2019s revenue derives from subscriptions. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom provides its Professional Services Segment with significant potential. Despite AI\u2019s popularity, corporate AI transition is complex and generally assisted by cyber companies. Will Crowdstrike leverage this market? It is highly likely.\n\nCRWD is grossly undervalued. For instance, its price-to-sales ratio of 25.58x is at a five-year discount near 12%. Moreover, the stock is trading above its 10-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages, indicating a momentum trend has occurred.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) operates in the advanced firewall and adjacent cloud-based business. The company hosts best-in-class status with a scintillating return on common equity ratio of\u00a089.52%. Additionally, the stock is highly touted on Wall Street, with numerous analysts backing it to succeed throughout 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few of the calls on Wall Street to set a baseline.\n\nEdward Stanley of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently added Palo Alto Networks to a list of \u201chigh productivity\u201d plays. The basis of Stanley\u2019s argument stems from AI integration and the phenomenon\u2019s operational efficiency benefits. Furthermore, Argus emphasized its bullish outlook on PANW earlier this month, upgrading PANW\u2019s price target to $336 from a previous $290 based on demand factors.\n\nMany investors are worried about Palo Alto Networks\u2019 strategy shift. In an announcement last month, Palo Alto\u2019s management indicated a pivot to provide more free offerings. This could potentially dent its billings by $600 million toward the back end of this year. However, this is a temporary change in strategy to stimulate long-term demand. Basically, Palo Alto\u2019s decision is long-term value-driven. Further, the firm has a cash position of nearly\u00a0$3.37\u00a0billion.\n\nAlso, the stock has a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of\u00a00.01x,\u00a0and the company has a five-year compound annual growth rate of\u00a023.75%. Considering these metrics alongside Palo Alto Networks\u2019 fundamentals, consider it a growth-at-a-reasonable price opportunity.\n\nRadware (RDWR) An image of a shield hovering above a motherboard with a forcefield surrounding it, a person holding a tablet stands facing it\n\nSource: Ico Maker / Shutterstock\n\nRadware (NASDAQ:RDWR) is primarily known for protecting against identity theft, protection against malicious user behavior, and related cloud protection services. Although mostly used for Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) applications, Radware is positioned for future expansion, providing its investors with much to anticipate.\n\nThe company and the stock alike possess numerous tailwinds. First, Radware recently signed a downstream agreement with Spark NZ. This allows Spark to re-sell its services throughout New Zealand, providing Radware with geographic diversification. Furthermore, Radware released its fourth-quarter earnings, beating its revenue target by $990,000 and its earnings target by one cent per share.\n\nFurthermore, its annual recurring revenue grew by 22% YOY. Moreover, RDWR has a price-to-sales ratio of merely 3.12x. Is RDWR undervalued? I certainly think so.\n\nOn the date of publication, Steve Booyens did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 83%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Palo Alto Networks implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price The top 25 shareholders own 46% of the company Ownership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock\n\nEvery investor in Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 83% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Palo Alto Networks.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nPalo Alto Networks already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Palo Alto Networks' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Palo Alto Networks is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.6% and 3.9% of the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$906m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Palo Alto Networks. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Palo Alto Networks (including 1 which doesn't sit too well with us) .\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Cybersecurity Trends: Top 10 ETFs For Cyber Defense",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 ETFs for cyber defense. If you want to skip our discussion on the cybersecurity industry, head over to Cybersecurity Trends: Top 5 ETFs For Cyber Defense.\n\nIn 2024, Gartnerpredicts several significant cybersecurity trends driven by Generative AI (GenAI), unsecure employee behavior, third-party risks, continuous threat exposure, boardroom communication gaps, and identity-first security approaches. These trends include the rapid evolution of Generative AI, increasing reliance on outcome-driven metrics (ODMs) to demonstrate cybersecurity investment's tangible protection levels, a shift towards behavioral change to reduce cybersecurity risks, the emphasis on resilience-oriented investments in light of third-party cybersecurity incidents, the adoption of continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) to evaluate and mitigate asset vulnerabilities, and the rising importance of an identity-first approach to security, particularly focusing on Identity and Access Management (IAM) to improve cybersecurity and business outcomes.\n\nIn recent years, the cybersecurity economy has experienced rapid growth, outpacing the overall world economy significantly. However, this growth has been uneven, with larger and more developed economies reaping most benefits while others lag behind. The 2024 Global Cybersecurity Outlook (GCO) by the World Economic Forumhighlights a concerning trend \u2013 organizations maintaining minimum viable cyber resilience are rapidly diminishing, down 31% since 2022. This widening gap between cyber-resilient organizations and those struggling to keep pace poses serious threats to the integrity of the entire cybersecurity ecosystem.\n\nThe uneven distribution of cyber resilience can be attributed to several factors. One significant factor is the cost associated with accessing cyber services, tools, and talent. Larger and more financially robust organizations are better equipped to invest in robust cybersecurity measures, leaving smaller and less affluent organizations at a disadvantage. Additionally, disparities in cyber skills and insurance adoption further exacerbate the divide. Smaller organizations, which are often more vulnerable to cyber threats, are three times less likely to carry cyber insurance compared to larger enterprises, creating a significant gap in risk mitigation strategies. Geographical disparities also play a role, with regions like Latin America and Africa reporting fewer cyber-resilient organizations compared to North America and Europe. This \"cybersecurity poverty line\" not only reflects financial constraints but also encompasses issues like the cyber skills gap and access to innovative technologies. The lack of sufficient cyber resilience among smaller organizations is particularly troubling, given the interconnected nature of the digital ecosystem. Despite some organizations seeing improvements in cyber resilience, the overall trend indicates a widening gap between cyber-resilient leaders and those struggling to adapt. While competition is healthy in traditional economic contexts, cyber leaders recognize that the interconnectedness of the digital landscape makes this growing divide more harmful than beneficial.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai believes that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence could play a crucial role in bolstering defenses against cybersecurity threats. Despite concerns about the potential misuse of AI, Pichai contends that these intelligence tools could aid governments and businesses in accelerating the detection and response to threats posed by hostile actors in cyberspace. Cybersecurity attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated, with malicious actors increasingly leveraging them to exert power and extort money. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, these attacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion in 2023, a figure projected to rise to $10.5 trillion by 2025. While some, like Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, warn that AI may exacerbate these threats by lowering the barriers to entry for cyber hackers, Pichai argues that AI can also reduce the time required for defenders to identify and counter attacks, thereby mitigating the defenders\u2019 dilemma. To address these challenges, Google has launched a new initiative offering AI tools and infrastructure investments aimed at enhancing online security. One such tool, Magika, is an open-source tool designed to detect malware, while a white paper proposes measures and research to safeguard AI. These efforts coincide with a pact signed by major companies at the Munich Security Conference to prevent AI tools from being used to disrupt democratic processes, particularly in the upcoming 2024 election year.\n\nSome of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy include Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW). However, we discuss the best cybersecurity ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the 5-year share price performance of each ETF as of March 21, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors.  Cybersecurity Trends: Top ETFs For Cyber Defense\n\nPhoto by Kaur Kristjan on Unsplash\n\nCybersecurity Trends: Top ETFs for Cyber Defense\n\n10. Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 10.27%\n\nThemes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM) aims to mirror the performance of the Solactive Cybersecurity Index, which is composed of the top 35 digital security software companies by market capitalization. Launched on December 8, 2023, Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM) seeks to match the price and yield of its benchmark index, with an expense ratio of 0.35%. It is one of the best cybersecurity ETFs to invest in.\n\nOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is one of the top holdings of Themes Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:SPAM). Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) operates globally as an identity management company, offering a suite of products and services to manage and secure user identities. On February 29, Okta shares experienced a premarket surge of over 20% following an upgrade from BofA. BofA raised Okta's rating from Underperform to Buy and set a price target of $135, citing strong fourth-quarter performance and the possibility of continued outperformance in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 47 hedge funds were bullish on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA), same as the prior quarter.\n\nIn addition to Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nMeridian Growth Fund made the following comment about Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the largest independent identity software company, serving enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits, and government agencies across the globe. Its solutions provide higher-level security authentication services, a business-critical function that has the attention of CEOs and IT leaders everywhere. The company\u2019s integration with 7,000 other software vendors and system providers is a competitive advantage that enables rapid and seamless implementations. Okta\u2019s complete product suite allows customers to deploy an enterprise-wide identity platform that serves both the workforce segment (clients\u2019 employees) and the customer segments (clients\u2019 customers). The stock has started to recover after falling nearly 85% from post-COVID bubble levels due to a stabilization in the overall macro environment for security services. The company has also seen a normalization in salesforce attrition which had hampered growth. The stock moved higher during the quarter when it reported higher than expected revenues and a much-improved adjusted operating margin of 11% versus -3% in the prior year quarter. Beyond its core capabilities, which are in high demand, we are also encouraged by the company\u2019s ability to expand into product adjacencies such as privileged access management and identity governance. Due to these improving fundamentals, we added to our position in the company during the period.\u201d\n\n9. CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 21.45%\n\nCI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO) aims to replicate the performance of a global digital security industry index, after deducting expenses. It mirrors the Solactive Digital Security CAD Hedged Index, which tracks companies operating in the global digital security industry using the ARTIS classification system. The index also hedges foreign currency exposure to Canadian dollars. Established on February 24, 2022, CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO) charges a management fee of 0.40%. As of March 20, 2024, its net assets amount to C$2.50 million.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is the largest holding of CI Digital Security Index ETF (TSE:CBUG.TO). CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity solutions provider operating globally. On March 6, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) garnered attention after surpassing expectations in both fourth-quarter results and guidance, earning praise from Wall Street. J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Essex noted the company's progress towards a $100 billion market cap, citing improved growth, profitability, and free cash flow. He maintained an Overweight rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) and raised the price target to $371 from $350.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were long CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), compared to 69 funds in the last quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cImproving unit economics: Many of our companies were able to significantly expand margins during 2023 even though revenue growth decelerated for some of them, showcasing the power of their capital-light, recurring revenue business models, and their increased focus on efficiency. Another example is the cybersecurity platform, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is expected to increase its operating margins from 15.9% in 2022 to 20.8% in 2023 as a result of growing efficiencies, while the company\u2019s platform offering is resonating with an increasing number of customers (for example, deals with eight or more modules grew 78% year-over-year in the last quarter), which is a tailwind to sales productivity.\u201d\n\n8. Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 22.65%\n\nXtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD) ranks 8th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs. Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD) aims to match the performance of the Solactive Cyber Security ESG Screened Index, before fees and expenses. The ETF had net assets totaling $6.20 million as of March 20, 2024, with a net expense ratio of 0.20%. The fund was launched on July 13, 2023. It is one of the best cybersecurity ETFs to invest in.\n\nCyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) is one of the top holdings of Xtrackers Cybersecurity Select Equity ETF (NASDAQ:PSWD). The company develops and sells software-based identity security solutions globally. On February 8, CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.81 and a revenue of $223.1 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.34 and $13.36 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), up from 32 funds in the last quarter. Robert G. Moses\u2019 RGM Capital is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1 million shares worth $221.2 million.\n\nBaron Discovery Fund made the following comment about CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe initiated a position in CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), an identity security platform focused primarily on privileged access management (PAM). CyberArk\u2019s PAM technology prevents bad actors from stealing and exploiting the credentials of superuser accounts like IT administrators, cybersecurity managers, and network administrators. These privileged accounts can access a company\u2019s most critical IT systems\u2013domain directory servers (all passwords, profiles, and data on employees), firewalls, code repositories, and database servers\u2013making the credentials a high-value target in ransomware attacks (consulting firm Forrester estimates that 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials). CyberArk technology detects, stores, and manages all the privileged credentials in an organization, monitors the critical IT systems, and helps contain the damage hackers can cause if they breach a corporate network. The increasing frequency and severity of ransomware attacks, heightening geopolitical tension, and stricter requirements of cyber insurance policies have all made PAM a higher priority spending category among security teams.\n\nCyberArk is the market leader in the PAM category, with over 20% market share. The company has successfully leveraged its foothold to expand into complementary markets like identity and access management (authentication of a company\u2019s employees and vendors), secrets management (detection of credentials used for machine-to-machine communications), and endpoint management. These newer solutions now account for over 45% of annual subscription recurring revenue and are growing over 100% annually. CyberArk is also making good progress in its business model transition from on-premise (one-time perpetual license payment plus some recurring maintenance payments) to a recurring subscription revenue model. The new model expands CyberArk\u2019s addressable market, enables it to cross-sell products more efficiently, increases the lifetime value of its customers, and improves revenue predictability. Recurring revenue now accounts for more than 84% of total sales and annualized recurring revenue has been growing over 40% for the past four quarters. As subscription contracts come up for renewal in the next two to three years, we expect cash-flow margins to increase from mid-single digits today to CyberArk\u2019s healthy historical margin levels of 20%-plus. Long term, the combination of resilient end-market growth, better recurring revenue mix, and margin expansion should bode well for the stock.\u201d\n\n7. iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 23.92%\n\nRanking 7th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs is iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L). iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L) aims to mirror the performance of an index consisting of developed and emerging market companies with substantial revenues from digital security sectors. The ETF had net assets totaling $1.5 billion as of March 20, 2024, with an expense ratio of 0.40%. Its portfolio consists of 101 stocks. The fund was established on October 29, 2018.\n\nNutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) is one of the largest holdings of iShares Digital Security UCITS ETF USD Dist (LON:SHLG.L). The company offers an enterprise cloud platform globally, converging virtualization, storage, and networking services into a single solution.

The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 and a revenue of $565.2 million, exceeding Wall Street estimates by $0.17 and $14.81 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 48 hedge funds were long Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX), compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore\u2019s Generation Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 17.25 million shares worth $823 million.\n\nCarillon Chartwell Small Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWithin the Carillon Chartwell Small Cap Growth Fund, information technology and industrials were the strongest-performing sectors, with strong stock selection leading to alpha generation. The new management team at Nutanix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) continues to execute well, delivering another positive quarterly earnings surprise. Nutanix\u2019s core hyper converged infrastructure (HCI) technology continues to gain market share over its competitors.\u201d\n\n6. Global X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 21: 31.14%\n\nGlobal X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD) ranks 6th on our list of the best cybersecurity ETFs to buy. Global X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD) aims to invest in companies poised to benefit from the growing adoption of defense technology.

Global X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD) seeks to match the performance of the Global X Defense Tech Index before fees and expenses. As of March 20, 2024, the fund\u2019s net assets equal $31.98 million, along with an expense ratio of 0.50% and a portfolio comprising 34 stocks.\n\nRTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is one of the top holdings of Global X Defense Tech ETF (NYSE:SHLD). It is an aerospace and defense company serving commercial, military, and government customers globally.

Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with approximately 9 million shares worth $755.4 million.\n\nLike Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (NYSE:BAH), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), hedge funds are piling into RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nMatrix Asset Advisors made the following comment about RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn Q3, we started a new position in RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), formerly Raytheon Technologies, an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The company was formed in 2020 through the combination of Raytheon Company and the United Technologies Corporation aerospace businesses. We had previously owned United Technologies and were impressed with their CEO, Greg Hayes, now the CEO of RTX. The opportunity to purchase RTX came after the company disclosed a problem with an engine component that will result in a significant charge to inspect and replace. This is a fixable issue requiring time and money, but we believe the price decline provided a good opportunity to start a position in this highly profitable, well-managed company.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Cybersecurity Trends: Top 10 ETFs For Cyber Defense.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best States for Homeowners Insurance in the US 12 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 11 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "When you think of tech stocks, the phrase \"recession-proof\" doesn't normally spring to mind. That's because the industry is among the first to decline when fears of an impending economic downturn spike. Enterprises and consumers often look to delay or cancel IT spending when they're focused on saving cash, after all.\n\nThe cybersecurity niche within tech is a bit of an outlier, though. While it isn't immune to the swings in the wider economy, this industry is increasingly prioritized by big enterprises even when they are slashing spending elsewhere.\n\nYet not all cybersecurity specialists have what it takes to thrive in this competitive market. Let's take a closer look at a few that stand out as potential winners. Two in particular, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) and Okta(NASDAQ: OKTA), could make great long-term buy-and-hold stocks.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nThere's a lot to like about Palo Alto Networks, but Wall Street was disappointed by one key metric in its latest earnings report. The cybersecurity leader reduced its fiscal year outlook and executives now expect revenue to increase 15% to 16% rather than the prior forecast range of 18% to 19%. Understandably, the stock would drop after that downer of an update.\n\nBut Palo Alto Networks is still a strong business operating in a high-growth industry. Sales rose nearly 20% year over year in the most recent quarter on top of the prior year's 26% spike. It turns out enterprises are still finding room in their budgets to adopt its comprehensive security solutions platform. And the company maintained its forecast for generating a blazing 27% non-GAAP profit margin this year. Adjusted free cash flow will still land at nearly 40% of sales as well. Finally, Palo Alto Networks is on track for another year of profitability on the bottom line.\n\nThose factors should support market-beating returns for shareholders willing to hold this volatile stock for the next decade or longer.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Okta\n\nOkta stock is doing well in 2024 (up 17% so far), but its shares remain 63% below their 2021 pandemic peak. That situation sets up a potentially lucrative opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the cybersecurity market.\n\nOkta was focused on the digital identity management niche before its acquisition of the Auth0 platform closed last year. That buyout became a headache due to integration challenges, but the company seems to have put those issues behind it. Sales last quarter were up 19% year over year as enterprises spent aggressively on protecting their workflows.\n\nThe software-as-a-service specialist isn't generating consistent profits today, and that's a big knock against the stock. Yet look at cash flow trends and you'll feel more confident about its earnings potential. Okta generated $512 million of free cash flow last year, with its cash flow margin rising from 5% of sales to 23% of sales.\n\nInvestors expect modest growth in the year ahead, with most Wall Street pros looking for sales to rise by about 10% to $2.5 billion. Consider taking advantage of the fact that investors are impatiently seeking faster growth from other software specialists. Okta seems primed to build on its solid market share position over the next several years even as its cash flow begins to convert into positive annual earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Okta right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Okta, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Okta wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 best cities for cyber security jobs in the world. We have also discussed the growing demand in the field. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World.\n\nThe cybersecurity field is growing at an unprecedented scale as cybercrimes have increased by 300% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. This number is shedding light on the urgency of building strong defenses against online threats that has fuelled a 32% projected increase in cybersecurity jobs over the next decade. Presently, there are nearly 600,000 unfilled cybersecurity positions in the United States alone which confirms that there is an immense demand for skilled professionals in the industry.\n\nMoreover, the UK has also decided to double its investment in overseas cyber security projects, confirming the increasing seriousness of cyber threats. With an increase in spending to \u00a325mn ($32.02) in 2022-23, the government shows the understanding of the pressing need to fortify global digital defenses.\n\nDespite misconceptions about the field's exclusivity, cybersecurity offers high-paying opportunities without the need for a bachelor's degree. For example, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s initiative, Grow with Google, aims to address this gap by providing accessible online training in cybersecurity and other high-demand skills. With programs like these, individuals can acquire valuable certifications in as little as 3 months, setting them on a path to secure, well-compensated employment in cybersecurity.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that several specialized areas tend to offer lucrative compensation in the cyber security field due to their high demand and the level of expertise required. Among these, roles such as Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), security architects, and penetration testers often command the highest salaries.\n\nThe field of cybersecurity is not attractive solely because of the high salaries, in fact, the field also offers the flexibility of remote work and the satisfaction of combating digital threats across different sectors, including finance, healthcare, and government. Salaries in the field often exceed $100,000, with some remote positions offering upwards of $200,000 annually. Speaking of salaries, Virginia and California are the highest paying states for cyber security professionals, making them the best states for cyber security jobs. To read more about high-paying remote jobs, see the remote jobs that pay atleast $50 an hour.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in 2024, cybersecurity predictions point to an increase in AI-generated threats. Even though large language models have revolutionized organizational cybersecurity, limitations have made it necessary to shift towards specialized, smaller models. Threat actors are expected to exploit AI development through sophisticated phishing campaigns and deepfakes. Furthermore, according to the World Economic Forum, there's an anticipated spike in third-party data breaches, accentuated by a 72% increase observed in 2023. Consequently, organizations must fortify their cybersecurity posture by scrutinizing not only their practices but also those of their vendors.\n\nIn order to combat and raise awareness about the serious cyber threats, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its cybersecurity research center in Tokyo on March 7, 2024, aiming to improve security in the Asia-Pacific region. Situated in Tokyo's Roppongi district, the center will engage in cybersecurity policy discussions, educational initiatives, resource development, and research collaborations with Japanese institutions. Covering 13 countries, it serves as an Asia-Pacific hub for (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s cybersecurity efforts. The initiative coincides with Japan's \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month,\" highlighting how the country is committed to enhancing online security. With rising cyber threats, including government-targeted attacks and incidents like the Port of Nagoya ransomware attack, Japan is also actively working on its efforts to strengthen its cybersecurity infrastructure and promote regional collaboration.\n\nOn the other hand, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) have announced an expanded strategic partnership aimed at enhancing clients' cybersecurity capabilities. This collaboration signifies the importance of unified efforts in tackling evolving security threats. With this partnership, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) aim to provide end-to-end security solutions to clients. Notably, the partnership will focus on two critical areas: modernizing security operations and securing cloud transformations.\n\nThis joint venture will essentially capitalize on advanced AI and automation technologies to provide clients with autonomous and advanced managed security operations. This includes 24x7 monitoring, investigation, and automated remediation of security alerts. Moreover, the partnership will facilitate clients' journey to the cloud by leveraging Prisma Cloud byPalo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) in conjunction with International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) Consulting services. 15 Best Cities for Cyber Security Jobs in the World\n\nA high-rise office building, its staff busy at work providing cybersecurity services.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the best cities for cyber security jobs in the world, we first identified 15 countries with the highest salaries for cyber security jobs.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite was the worst performer among the major market indices in 2022 and made a stellar comeback in 2023. The index was down 33% at the end of 2022 and recovered from its abysmal performance with a 43% gain in 2023. To put things in perspective, the Nasdaq Composite index hit its previous record in November 2021 with a little over 16,000 points, and it was still a thousand points behind it by the end of 2023, even after the outstanding performance during the year. However, the index has hit new highs and is at 16,275 at March 1 market close. The Nasdaq-100, which includes the 100 largest and most actively traded non-financial companies in the world, recorded its fourth-best performance since 1986, with a 53.81% gain in 2023.\n\nNasdaq\u2019s performance is attributed to the fact that it is mostly concentrated in tech stocks, which were the best performers of the year in 2023. The Magnificent 7 stocks remained in the limelight as several of the top performers of the index were a part of the group, which include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and they gained 239% and 194% in 2023, respectively. However, some other stocks made significant strides through the year as well. Some of them are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), and Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) gained nearly 128%, and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) was 110% higher by the end of 2023. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) performed even more spectacularly in 2023 and is still on a remarkable upward trajectory in the current year. As of March 18, the stock has gained more than 900% over the past 12 months.\n\nAlthough 5 of the magnificent 7 stocks are still performing well and their price charts are still in green on a year-to-date basis, as of March 18, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have declined significantly. Apple is down 4.61%, and Tesla has also fallen out of favor among many analysts and is down 32% year-to-date. However, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest still sees long-term growth for Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock due to its autonomous driving software. Last year, Wood said in an interview on CNBC that she believes that the company\u2019s stock price will hit the $2000 mark by 2027. In 2024, the investor is still bullish on the stock. Ark Invest bought $141 million worth of Tesla, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock in January, as reported by Bloomberg on January 29. The firm also bought over $35 million worth of company shares on March 14, as reported by Business Insider on the same day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs There a Stop to the AI Rally?\n\nInvestors and analysts keep mixed reviews about the rising AI trend. While some believe that the AI surge could be a bubble and that tech stocks are now overvalued, others hold the opinion that AI is a revolutionary trend that will dominate the market for years to come. Looking at recent earnings of the tech stocks, the latter scenario is more likely.\n\nThe industry leader, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reported its Q4 earnings on February 21. It reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16, which was up 28% sequentially, and was 486% higher than last year. Furthermore, its revenue increased by 265% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.1 billion. The company's gross margin also increased by 10.6%, year over year, to 76.7% in the quarter. On March 18, Truist and HSBC raised NVIDIA\u2019s price target by $266 and $170, respectively. Truist has a price target of $1,177 for the stock, while HSBC\u2019s Frank Lee raised NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target to $1050. The stock is currently trading at around $885, as of March 18.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) first-rate earnings report, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) also showed strength in its earnings in the fourth quarter due to a high demand for its artificial intelligence servers. The company reported an EPS of $2.20 and a revenue of $22.32 billion, which outperformed the market estimates by $0.48 and $150 million, respectively. The stock gained 31.5% in a day on March 1 and is up nearly 13% month-to-date as of March 18. Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) also increased its quarterly dividend by 20%. The company\u2019s earnings revived investor belief in AI, and most of the industry-related stocks moved higher during the day. At Dell Technologies\u2019 (NYSE:DELL) Q4 2024 earnings call, COO and Vice Chairman of the company, Jeffrey Clark, highlighted the demand growth for AI-optimized servers. He said:\n\n\u201cAI-optimized server orders increased by nearly 40% sequentially. We shipped $800 million of AI-optimized servers, and our backlog nearly doubled sequentially, exiting the fiscal year at $2.9 billion. Demand continues to outpace GPU supply, though we are seeing H100 lead times improving. We are also seeing strong interest in orders for AI-optimized servers equipped with the next generation of AI GPUs, including the H200 and the MI300X. Most customers are still in the early stages of their AI journey, and they are very interested in what we are doing at Dell. We are helping them get started and work through their use cases, data preparation, training, and infrastructure requirements.\u201d\n\nNow let us continue to our list of NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside potential, which includes Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).

Next, we checked each stock\u2019s analyst ratings and price targets on TipRanks. We then chose the 10 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside at the time of writing on March 18 and listed the stocks in ascending order.\n\nWe also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds as of Q4, 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 22.99%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 47\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is a Texas-based company that offers energy and industrial solutions. According to TipRanks, the stock has a consensus rating of Strong Buy as per the 14 Wall Street analysts that covered it over the past three months. The average price target of $39.85 implies an upside of 22.99% from the current levels at the time of writing on March 18.\n\nOn February 21, Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) announced that it won a significant and multi-year award for the provision of integrated well construction services for rigs in the Buzios pre-salt field offshore Brazil. The work on the three rigs is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) was part of 47 hedge funds\u2019 portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a total stake value of $911.825 million. AQR Capital Management is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth nearly $137.851 million, as of Q4, 2023.\n\nBaker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) is one of the top NASDAQ stocks with the biggest upside, along with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:VSAT), and Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN).\n\nClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPerformance was boosted in the quarter by the Strategy\u2019s more economically-sensitive holdings among steady compounders and evolving opportunities. Oilfield equipment and services provider Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR), meanwhile, benefited from a $20 rise in crude oil prices as well as disciplined execution.\u201d\n\n9. Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 44.79%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nInsulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) is engaged in developing, manufacturing, and distributing insulin management systems for diabetic patients. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds had stakes in Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) with total positions worth $1.197 billion. This is compared to 44 funds with positions worth $938.370 million in the preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2023, Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $288.885 million.\n\nOn February 7, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) announced that its Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system with Abbott Laboratories\u2019 (NYSE:ABT) FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus sensor received CE Mark approval.\n\nIn the past three months, 12 Wall Street analysts have covered Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD), and 9 maintain a Buy rating on the stock. At the time of writing on March 18, the average price target of $238.33 has an upside of 44.79% from present levels.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cResults were primarily impacted by weakness among two health care holdings, Insulet Corporation (NASDAQ:PODD) and Surgery Partners. Positive clinical studies for GLP-1 therapeutics showed substantial health benefits to diabetic and obese patients, boosting stock prices of pharmaceutical companies tied to the manufacturing of these drugs. The potential for improved patient outcomes raised the risk of lower utilization for Insulet, a maker of insulin patch pumps, and Surgery Partners, whose outpatient surgery centers conduct weight loss and many other types of outpatient procedures. Though the GLP-1 threat is weighing on the valuation multiple of Insulet, any negative effects would likely not meaningfully affect the business for many years, especially given how large and underpenetrated the Type 2 diabetes market is for the company currently. Additionally, this could require significant improvements in cost, availability, and adherence for GLP-1s. Furthermore, we are encouraged that the majority of Insulet\u2019s business today is still from Type 1 diabetes, where fundamentals remain strong and the company is gaining share.\u201d\n\n8.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe rules have improved how we analyze existing holdings and influenced the price at which we will buy a new holding and/or trim or add to an existing one. This has resulted in a higher level of resizing positions in the portfolio and exiting some long-term holdings this year. A good example in the portfolio today is Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), a company that we bought too early but that remains a holding in the portfolio. Our average price for the initial WBD investment in 2021 was $26.48, or a P/V ratio in the mid-60s%. However, P/EV on the initial report was 79%. Under the new rules, we would not pay that price for the company today. We most likely would have waited for a mid-60s% P/EV, which would have equated to a $mid-teens entry price. In this case, we would have missed a too-large initial downturn in the stock price. The overweight rule dictated that we trimmed the position after the price ran up in the first half of 2023, which benefitted overall performance as the stock price subsequently fell again. However, even with the new rule lens, we remain confident in our case for the business and management\u2019s ability to deliver going forward.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n17 Worst Bachelor\u2019s Degrees for Student Loan Debt 13 Best EV Stocks To Buy in 2024 13 Best NASDAQ Penny Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Is Palo Alto Networks Stock Going Back to $350? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) stock sat on a wall. Palo Alto Networks had a great fall (dropping 28.5% after earnings last month). Can all the king's horses and all the king's men, bid Palo Alto Networks stock back up to $350 again?\n\nThat's the question facing investors today, as equity researcher Redburn Atlantic raises its price target on Palo Alto stock to $350. That's about what the stock cost right up until Palo Alto reported fiscal Q2 2024 earnings on Feb. 21 and warned that its cybersecurity business is slowing.\n\nIs Palo Alto stock a buy?\n\nQ2 2024 results were great -- sales jumped 19% year over year, and profits were up nearly 19-fold. But then Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora spooked investors with talk of a new \"platformization and consolidation\" strategy that could slow sales growth to 13% year over year in Q3, and reduce billings growth to 2%.\n\nRedburn analyst Nina Marques isn't scared though. Near-term, \"platformization\" may slow Palo Alto's growth rate, as the company offers customers discounts to sign up for bundled services. But in the long term, she sees platformization delivering \"massive returns\" for Palo Alto as the company leverages artificial intelligence to enhance cybersecurity across its products. Yes, Marques says Palo Alto is an AI stock.\n\nSo how might this play out in practice? At a current market cap of $92 billion and a projected long-term growth rate of 18.5%, I'd like to see Palo Alto generate about $5 billion in free cash flow to justify its current valuation -- but most analysts don't see that happening before 2027. This year, the stock is only expected to generate $3.1 billion in free cash flow, which tells me Palo Alto is probably overpriced even at the $281 it currently costs. It's definitely not worth $350 a share, unless the company grows a whole lot faster than most analysts think it will.\n\nLong story short, Redburn is wrong on this one. Palo Alto may be a fine company, but its stock isn't going to $350 anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this security software maker have returned -22.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palo Alto falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nPalo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.49 points to a change of +23.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of +11.2% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8 billion and $9.17 billion estimates indicate +16.1% and +14.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.22%. The EPS surprise was +12.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is CrowdStrike Stock a Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) outspoken Co-Founder and CEO George Kurtz went on the offensive during the last quarterly conference call and the market reacted well to what he had to say. As a result, shares of the leading endpoint-cybersecurity software provider have held on to most of their 200%-plus gain since the start of 2023.\n\nKurtz threw some subtle shade at numerous cybersecurity peers on the last earnings update, even name-dropping Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) as CrowdStrike's unified platform is attempting to gobble up market share of a fiercely competitive security-software market. (For the record, Palo Alto's CEO, as well as Zscaler's (NASDAQ: ZS) and Cloudflare's respective co-founders and CEOs, also tend to talk a lot about their peers' failings on quarterly calls with investors.)\n\nPeeling away all of cybersecurity leaders' chutzpah reveals solid reasons investors should still be paying attention to CrowdStrike and might even consider buying shares even as it trades near all-time highs.\n\nA market ripe for consolidation\n\nAll of the cybersecurity pure-play leaders (which exclude big, diversified tech companies, including the Magnificent Seven, all of which have various types of cybersecurity offerings) have been talking a lot about \"platforming\" in the industry. What's that?\n\nAfter years of fast-evolving, enterprise security needs, accelerated by the advent of cloud computing and the pandemic, organizations have a multitude of cybersecurity vendors to choose from. But the leaders -- CrowdStrike in endpoint security for things like laptops and other mobile devices, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT) in older network security, and Zscaler in cloud-based network security -- are looking to expand their offerings and provide their customers with more of an all-in-one package. Not only would fewer vendors simplify a security team's life, but consolidation can also lead to better outcomes.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike in particular thinks this latter point works in its favor. Kurtz and company often talk up CrowdStrike's single platform that covers multiple needs in software security. That can make keeping tabs on security a cinch, rather than having to manage multiple modules and dashboards with disparate data (see chart below). Chart source: CrowdStrike.\n\nAll of this talk about displacing smaller players to consolidate the complicated cybersecurity field has some truth to it. The biggest four players have been growing their sales at a faster-than-industry-average pace for some time, which, overall, has been outstanding at a low-teens percentage rate of growth. CrowdStrike has been a particular standout over the last five years, as it just achieved its first year with sales exceeding $3 billion. CRWD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nCrowdStrike's enduring advantage in the security software race?\n\nCrowdStrike, in spite of all its spectacular growth, hasn't appealed to a broad group of investors since its initial public offering (IPO) in 2019. That's because up until the second half of fiscal 2024 (the 12-month period ended in January 2024), CrowdStrike operated at a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) loss. Of course, the company always showed promise of eventually achieving GAAP profitability. Its free cash flow (FCF) has been positive and rising for a long time.\n\nHowever many investors who favor a \"value\" have called out high amounts of employee stock-based compensation (which is excluded in the FCF calculation) as a sore spot. There's good reason to worry about stock-based compensation, as it can excessively dilute existing shareholders. However, CrowdStrike has now successfully scaled its business to profitability on all counts, which could please a new group of would-be owners of the stock. And on a per-share basis (which accounts for a growing share count), the argument that stock-based compensation is diluting shareholders hasn't held much weight. CRWD EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nMore importantly than CrowdStrike's fist-pumping about its software technology, profit metrics like this help confirm that a company also has the right business model to succeed over the long term. To be clear, CrowdStrike still has lots of progress to make on this front. But as it extends its cybersecurity platform, the profit margins should continue to tick higher.\n\nThis is no cheap stock, so not all value investors will want to bite. CrowdStrike currently trades for over 80 times this year's expected GAAP earnings per share and over 60 times next year's early expectation for earnings. Nevertheless, with the company expecting to grow its revenue by another 30% in calendar year 2024, there's a lot to like about CrowdStrike if you plan to buy and hold for the long term. I recently nibbled a bit more of this stock, and it will remain on my watch list.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in March",
        "content": "According to Statista, the cybersecurity industry was worth just shy of $300 billion in 2022 and is projected to approach $540 billion by the decade's end. This underlines how serious corporations have become about protecting themselves and their data against hackers and malicious actors.\n\nIt's an opportunity no long-term investor should skip past. The companies providing next-generation security solutions could grow for years to come.\n\nPalo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), SentinelOne(NYSE: S), and Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) are three cybersecurity stocks that fit this description. Long-term investors should consider buying them this month.\n\nHere is why:\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks is a buy after a much-needed drop\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a cybersecurity company that specializes in firewall security. A firewall is like a security guard at a wedding, checking invitations to ensure nobody, like that crazy ex-boyfriend, makes it inside. In technology, the firewall monitors network traffic that comes and goes. Its business spans three units: network security, cloud security, and security operations.\n\nThe company recently reported earnings for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024. The stock plunged, primarily due to soft guidance that indicates year-over-year revenue growth will slow next quarter to 13% to 15%, down from 19% in Q2. Additionally, billings for the next quarter are expected to grow by just 2% to 4%.\n\nManagement is transitioning the business to a unified platform model, where everything it sells would fall under one offering. Management believes customers' desire to consolidate IT budgets is temporarily impacting revenue growth.\n\nThis could be seen as a speed bump and something worth watching. On the other hand, analysts are still very optimistic about the business, estimating earnings growth averaging over 26% annually for the next three to five years. That growth makes its forward P/E of 51 a reasonable price tag for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. SentinelOne's improving financials could boost shares\n\nSentinelOne is squarely in that conversation around next-generation security. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to map out and proactively hunt for suspicious device files instead of waiting to react to a threat. The technology has garnered high marks from third-party consulting firms like Gartner and Mitre. SentinelOne began in endpoint security, protecting devices connected to networks, but has expanded into cloud and identity security over the past two years.\n\nThe business has grown significantly since going public roughly three years ago, including $573 million in revenue over the past four quarters. It's rapidly approaching the billion-dollar milestone, and its financials have improved.\n\nWhile it still isn't profitable, SentinelOne's cash burn is trending in the right direction, at just $30 million last quarter. The company has $800 million in cash and zero debt, so funding is no concern.\n\nThe lack of profits has penalized the stock. Shares trade at a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of just 10, half what its profitable direct competitor, CrowdStrike Holdings, trades at. Investors buying today could enjoy an upward lift on the valuation as SentinelOne keeps progressing toward turning a profit.\n\n3. Fortinet isn't cheap, but is still worth checking out\n\nFortinet is a diversified security company. It sells various security solutions across its three units: Unified SASE, Security Operations, and Secure Networking. According to Gartner's Magic Quadrant system, it's a leader in network firewalls and SD-WAN security and shows up in six additional quadrants. The diversity means Fortinet enjoys a large footprint in the market; it currently works with 76 corporations in the Fortune 100 and 69% of the Global 2,000.\n\nThe company grew revenue by 20% in 2023, but growth has slowed, including just 10.3% year-over-year in Q4. Management is guiding for just under 10% growth for 2024, so it's not growing as quickly as some of its industry peers. However, the company is more mature and profitable than many.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings to grow by an average of 16% annually over the next three to five years. The business will do nearly $6 billion in revenue this year. Management believes its long-term addressable market could grow to $208 billion by 2027.\n\nMeanwhile, the stock trades at 42 times its estimated 2024 earnings. That's not a bargain for high-teens earnings growth, but Fortinet is still one of the most prominent players in a growing and in-demand industry.\n\nConsider adding one or all of these stocks to a diversified long-term portfolio. Cybersecurity is notoriously complex and competitive, so putting your money behind multiple players is smart.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "11 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of cybersecurity stocks and the industry, then you can skip ahead to the 5 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts.\n\nWhile most attention this year has focused on artificial intelligence, space exploration, or weight loss drugs, quietly in the background, one sector has reminded everyone once again that it is just as important as any other industry. This sector is none other than cybersecurity, and as we settle into 2024, a war of sorts has broken out in the digital world.\n\nIf you've been unfortunate enough to have dealt with the healthcare system over the past month, then it's possible that you faced a disruption on the insurance front. If so, then this was because the systems of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)'s business division Change Healthcare were hacked, which led to a suspension of insurance claims processing at pharmacies across several areas. Immediately after the attack, reports surfaced that the ransomware group BlackHat might be responsible, as it had vowed to target healthcare facilities after the U.S. Justice Department had shared in December 2023 that it had conducted a massive operation against the group to seize its digital assets and other tools. It later turned out that the suspicions were correct, with UnitedHealth's vice president confirming the fact in a statement given to TechCrunch.\n\nSince the hack led to pharmacies and hospitals being unable to process payments, it resulted in a cash shortage as healthcare providers were unable to make their payments on time but had to provide services to patients and customers at the same time. However, despite its scale, the ransomware attack isn't the only cybersecurity threat that has been in the news lately. One of the biggest technology stocks and companies in the world, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) joined the choir in March 2024 when it shared that a Russian hacker gang's data breach in January that led to the leaking of data of Microsoft employees was being used for another cyberattack. While the Russian embassy in the U.S. does not respond to Microsoft's allegations, the firm is quite persistent with them, and the latest attack led cybersecurity professionals to worry that perhaps the hackers were trying to embed backdoors in Microsoft's software products.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at these striking developments, one would wonder that perhaps investing in cybersecurity stocks is a sound decision. After all, the copious amounts of data generated and stored every day create incentives for nefarious actors to try their hand at quick riches, and in the process, it also generates demand for cybersecurity products. Companies that provide cybersecurity services, such as Gen Digital Inc. (NASDAQ:GEN) are typically classified as cybersecurity stocks, but due to the polar nature of the technology industry where giants like Microsoft dominate several industries, other firms such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are also key players in the industry. For those out of the loop, Alphabet's cybersecurity division Mandiant was at the center of efforts to determine the roots of UnitedHealth's ransomware attack, after Google bought the firm for a cool $5.4 billion in 2022.\n\nSo, as the thinking goes, since there are more cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity stocks are great to invest in as more global organizations look towards them to secure infrastructure and data worth billions of dollars. To check whether this hypothesis holds water, let's take a look at the performance of the S&P Kensho Cyber Security Index. The group of stocks that seek to provide digital security services to businesses is up by a respectable 35% over the past twelve months, a time period that has not only seen law enforcement fend off ransomware gangs but also a complicated global political landscape in which Chinese hackers like the uniquely named \"Volt Typhoon\" roam free. Year to date, the stock index's price appreciation dimmed down to 4.5%, as technology stocks experienced a broader lift on the back of investor hopes of interest rate cuts in 2024 despite inflation being higher than what the Federal Reserve's public statements would prefer.\n\nIn a world beset with physical and digital threats, it's also important to see what the smart money thinks when it comes to cybersecurity stocks. On this front, here is what Artisan Partners' fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter had to say about the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD):\n\nTop-performing securities CrowdStrike Holdings, a security software provider, reported strong earnings results \u2013 driven by strength in cloud security and identity protection \u2013 with a better than expected profitability profile. Cyber threats remain elevated, and it is likely that the rise of artificial intelligence will make it easier for criminals to generate and scale more sophisticated attacks, which could increase the demand for CrowdStrike products in the years ahead.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks according to analysts. A couple of names are Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), Telos Corporation (NASDAQ:TLS), and Arqit Quantum Inc. (NASDAQ:ARQQ). 11 Most Undervalued Cybersecurity Stocks To Buy According To Analysts\n\nPhoto by Obie Fernandez on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most undervalued cybersecurity stocks to buy according to analysts, we ranked the U.S. traded holdings of the Global X Cybersecurity ETF\u00a0 by their average analyst share price target percentage upside and picked out the top stocks.\n\nFor these undervalued cybersecurity stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "content": "Why SentinelOne (S) Shares Are Plunging Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cyber security company SentinelOne (NYSE:S) fell 16.7% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided revenue guidance for the upcoming year, which came in below expectations, suggesting a slowdown in demand amidst an intense competitive landscape with cybersecurity peers like CrowdStrike. In addition, its net revenue retention rate of 115% missed estimates of 118%. That means its existing customers bought fewer products, and the company is more dependent on new customers (expensive to acquire) to generate growth. Guidance was also underwhelming, with the revenue projections for the next quarter and full year roughly in line with expectations. Overall, this was a tough quarter for SentinelOne.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy SentinelOne? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSentinelOne's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 28 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for SentinelOne and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago, when the company gained 10.8% on the news that peer, CrowdStrike reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results.\n\nSentinelOne is down 9.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $23.37 per share it is trading 22.1% below its 52-week high of $30 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of SentinelOne's shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $549.60.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

        "content": "In the dynamic market, certain stocks emerge as titans. They are disrupting traditional markets and hold meteoric growth potential. Among these market disruptors, there are three high contenders. Each represents a distinct sector: health care, consumer discretionary, and information technology.\n\nYet, each company shares a common thread of expansion and strategic edge. As the investment space evolves, their valuations may be propelled by shifting demand behaviors and technological advancements. These stocks offer more than a high return promise. They embody a market-disrupting core within and the potential for exponential growth through their focus on scalability and sustainable growth.\n\nThe first one has aggressive subscriber expansion, whereas the second one has strategic diversification. Meanwhile, the third one is leading in cybersecurity solutions. All three set the stage for a transformative valuation surge.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRead more to explore the intricate strategic web of market leads. Learn how these stocks may redefine investment returns with a projected 400% leap in the next two years.\n\nHims & Hers (HIMS) The logo for Hims & Hers (HIMS) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nHims & Hers (NYSE:HIMS) has attained considerable subscriber growth. This can be observed in the increase in its subscriber base, representing a 48% YoY growth. This substantial expansion in subscribers suggests the company\u2019s fundamental capability to attract and retain customers, boosting its market reach and top-line potential.\n\nAdditionally, the trend of subscriber growth points out Hims & Hers\u2019 lead in scaling its platform and increasing its user base over time. The YoY boost indicates a solid demand for the company\u2019s offerings. This is also based on solid marketing strategies, personalized offerings, and positive subscriber experiences.\n\nMoreover, the constant quarterly growth in subscribers throughout 2023 signals the edge of the company\u2019s subscriber expansion efforts. By steadily increasing its subscriber base each quarter, Hims & Hers signifies its fundamental capability to sustain momentum and derive long-term value growth through an ending user community.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Hims & Hers has delivered an efficient operational edge, reflected in profitability and cost control metrics. The company\u2019s capability to manage its operations sharply leads to its consolidated performance. One main metric in this context is the gross margin, which hit\u00a082% in 2023 against 78% in 2022. This increase in gross margin reflects the company\u2019s capability to optimize its cost structure, improve product margins, and boost operational efficiency with time.\n\nLastly, another core indicator is adjusted EBITDA. This has reached\u00a0$49.5 million for 2023, up from a negative $15.8 million in 2022. This considerable improvement in adjusted EBITDA suggests Hims & Hers\u2019 ability to derive positive operating income and bottom line through disciplined costing and top-line growth strategies. Hence, these developments bring massive valuation potential to Hims & Hers.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB)\n\nAirbnb\u2019s (NASDAQ:ABNB) focus on mainstreaming hosting can be observed in the growth of its host community. The number hosts reached 5 million globally at the end of 2023. Additionally, the active listings exceeded 7.7 million, representing an 18% YoY increase. Expanding its accommodation inventory has made solid progress in Airbnb\u2019s efforts to attract and retain hosts.\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on perfecting its core service is reflected in introducing over 430 new features and upgrades in the past three years. Notably, a post-cancellations\u00a0YoY drop of 36% in Q4 2023 suggests reliability and customer experience improvements.\n\nFurthermore, Airbnb\u2019s focus on underpenetrated international markets\u2014Germany, Brazil and Korea\u2014supports its strategic shift towards expanding beyond its core business. The company\u2019s rollout of its playbook in new countries and regions reflects its sharp approach to expansion and diversification.\n\nThis tangible progress and achievement reinforce Airbnb\u2019s strategic priorities. In Q4 2023, Airbnb attained a solid top-line of\u00a0$2.2 billion, a considerable 70% YoY boost. This indicates the company\u2019s capability to sharply monetize its platform and capitalize on the growing demand for accommodations and experiences.\n\nDespite a net loss of $249 million, Airbnb attained an adjusted net income margin of 22%, excluding non-recurring tax items. Hence, this reflects the company\u2019s proficiency in managing costs and optimizing the bottom line.\u00a0Overall, Airbnb\u2019s solid top-line and bottom-line growth reflects its leading market position and capability to derive growth through its platform.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW)\n\nPalo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) leads in deriving adoption across its three platforms: network security, Prisma Cloud and Cortex. The company attained considerable milestones in Q2 2024. It includes constant growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) business. This is also a strong trend in multi-module adoption within Prisma Cloud.\n\nIn the network security business, Palo Alto Networks delivered continued progress in deriving ARR growth in its SASE business. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth. Additionally,\u00a0more than 30% of new SASE customers signed in Q2 were new to Palo Alto. This indicates the company\u2019s capability to win market share and expand its client base.\n\nPalo Alto has significantly invested in Prisma Cloud to acquire new customers. This has resulted in the highest new annual contract value (ACV) growth in five quarters. The company also has solid trends in multi-module adoption. Moreover, there is nearly 30% growth in customers using two or more modules and nearly 60% in customers using three or more modules.\n\nIn Cortex, Palo Alto continued to leverage its autonomous security operations platform (XSIAM), which is a catalyst for large transactions and growth across the business. XSIAM adoption saw considerable progress in Q2. Most deals were signed in a single quarter, and bookings exceeded $90 million.\n\nFinally, Palo Alto\u2019s platform adoption and cross-selling leads reflect its fundamental capability to deliver high-quality cybersecurity solutions to capture diverse market demand. Therefore, by expanding its offerings and capturing additional business from existing and new customers, the company may continue to derive top-line growth and solidify its valuation growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Internet - Software stocks have likely encountered both Magnite (MGNI) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nMagnite and Palo Alto Networks are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MGNI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PANW has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nMGNI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 45.36, while PANW has a forward P/E of 51.83. We also note that MGNI has a PEG ratio of 1.33. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PANW currently has a PEG ratio of 1.95.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for MGNI is its P/B ratio of 2.23. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PANW has a P/B of 21.11.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, MGNI holds a Value grade of B, while PANW has a Value grade of F.\n\nStory continues\n\nMGNI is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that MGNI is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Little-Known Cybersecurity Stock Investors Should Be Watching for 2024",
        "content": "Cybersecurity heavyweights are locked in a war of words. During a recent round of conference calls, and later in follow-ups on Twitter/X, CEOs from Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) and CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) both took shots at competitors, including each other. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz even name-dropped Palo Alto in his prepared remarks, even though the two juggernauts don't directly compete in their core businesses of network security (Palo Alto) and endpoint security (CrowdStrike).\n\nMeanwhile, smaller players are delivering solid, profitable growth in the background. One of those cybersecurity providers is Qualys (NASDAQ: QLYS), which just reported another round of consistent financial results. The stock has doubled in the last five years, even after a recent sell-off. Here's what investors should know about Qualys for 2024 and beyond.\n\nA compelling cybersecurity stock\n\nQualys offers a cloud-based set of software tools that help organizations with security compliance. It scans for security vulnerabilities and suggests fixes to weaknesses it finds. As IT infrastructure has gotten more complicated with a mix of legacy internal networks and public cloud, the number of devices and apps large businesses need to track and keep secure has ballooned. The Qualys platform can play an integral role in a company's cybersecurity efforts.\n\nQualys isn't the fastest-growing cyber specialist in the industry, averaging a low- to mid-teens percentage revenue growth rate since 2020. It's a small player with revenue of just $555 million in 2023 (compared to billions in annual sales at the largest cybersecurity pure plays). And where many security software platform providers struggle with profitability, Qualys actually offers investors a compelling proposition with robust GAAP net income and free cash flow (FCF) generation despite its size. FCF profit margin was an impressive 42.5% last year, one of the best rates of cash generation among its peer group.\n\nStory continues QLYS Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nQualys has been plowing big chunks of this FCF into share repurchases, returning $171 million and $317 million to shareholders in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The balance sheet is also rock solid with $426 million in cash and short-term investments and zero debt.\n\nQualys expects to grow revenue 8% to 10% in 2024, according to management's current outlook. Again, no growth records to be found here, but paired with its profitability and healthy balance sheet, there could be a lot to like about Qualys for the right investor.\n\nIs competition going to crush Qualys?\n\nAs a high-profit business, Qualys stock is a rare value play in the high growth but usually high premium cybersecurity market. Shares of Qualys currently trade for 42 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) and 27 times trailing-12-month FCF.\n\nHowever, some of the jockeying between Palo Alto and CrowdStrike could actually hurt small companies like Qualys the most. The two cybersecurity giants are expanding into ancillary areas. That includes compliance and data security posture management (DSPM), the very niche Qualys and other small peers like Tenable operate in.\n\nBoth Palo Alto and CrowdStrike made DSPM acquisitions in recent months (Palo Alto purchased Dig and Flow Security just announced it will be joining CrowdStrike) to grow their own platforms and expand their security software market share.\n\nQualys is definitely worth watching this year. The company is still putting up respectable numbers, and it clearly offers a valuable service that many organizations need right now. But with competition mounting, shares still look a bit pricey to me at the moment -- even if it's a relative value compared to larger peers. I'm nevertheless interested enough to keep tabs on this small business as 2024 progresses and the cybersecurity wars heat up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Qualys right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Qualys, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Qualys wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Generative AI and AI-related startups attracted close to $50 billion in investments, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection were some startups that attracted the most significant share of venture capital investments. For instance, Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations.\n\nAnthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion. More than 70 rounds of $100 million funding went into startups creating AI-powered models, providing infrastructure, and applying the technology to various applications.

We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 \u2013\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover \u2013 performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get \u2018lucky\u2019 investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).\u201d\n\n6. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nYTD Performance as of March 7, 2024: +20.7%\n\nSalesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) expanding its AI offerings by introducing a bot that helps users spot their work charts.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s Keith Weiss wrote in a note: \u201cLow investor expectations versus potential top-line upside drivers in price increases, product bundling and data cloud adoption, frame an attractive risk-reward for Salesforce\u201d.\n\nIn December 2023, 131 of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were the Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)'s stakeholders. The biggest Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) shareholder out of these is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management due to its $3.93 billion stake.\n\nHere is what Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and\u00a0Salesforce, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Wall Street Picked These 5 AI Stocks for 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In 12 Best Battery Stocks To Invest In Before They Take Off 16 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Invest In in 2024\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "SentinelOne (S) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cyber security company SentinelOne (NYSE:S) jumped 10.8% in the pre-market session after peer, CrowdStrike reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results.\n\nIs now the time to buy SentinelOne? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSentinelOne's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 29 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for SentinelOne and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago, when the company dropped 11.7% as cybersecurity stocks fell after industry stalwart, Palo Alto Networks reported fourth-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. This is never a good sign. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well.\n\nPalo Alto Networks highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) Customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments. The long-term demand forecast provided was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of \"a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a \"platformization\" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, Palo Alto Networks noted that a typical customer adopting the platform \" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months.\" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.\n\nOverall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance highlighting several issues within the business as well as potential challenges for cybersecurity players in the coming quarter.\n\nSentinelOne is up 3.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $26.81 per share it is still trading 10.6% below its 52-week high of $30 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of SentinelOne's shares at the IPO in June 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $630.12.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

        "title": "Nancy Pelosi Alert: 3 Stocks That Members of Congress Are Buying",
        "content": "Given differing perspectives, there has been significant discussion regarding whether members of Congress should be permitted as they have access to information that helps them profit from stock trades, whether they are actively trading or not. Some argue politicians have demonstrated an uncanny ability to time their stock investments to maximize financial gains, prompting calls for stricter regulations and a new ban for Congress members and their immediate families.\n\nHowever, academic research suggests that stocks members of Congress are buying are most likely picked at random. Only a select few demonstrate greater aptitude in the financial markets than in the legislative process.\n\nOn the other hand, ban supporters argue that politicians can use close family members, such as spouses and children, to get around scrutiny of trades. It is still possible to track the stocks members of Congress are buying and get a glimpse of their recent trading activity, whether they are actively trading or their spouses and dependents. The success of some members of Congress has even inspired brokers to propose the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on their stock picks.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, let us examine some of the more successful stocks members of Congress \u2014 or their spouses and dependents \u2014 are buying:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW), the California-based cybersecurity firm, saw its shares jump 9% after disclosure that former Speaker Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi purchased call options in the company. Pelosi isn\u2019t the only major politician investing in the company, as data shows five other members of Congress from Republican and Democratic parties have also taken stakes in PAWN. However, Pelosi\u2019s prominence and ability to achieve a 91% return on her investment over the last 12 months has generated the most attention, despite it was revealed that the calls\u2019 owner was a spouse.\r\n\r\nPAWN\u2019s share price fell after reporting disappointing quarterly earnings a couple of weeks ago, and currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.4x. This is only slightly above the average for the broader U.S. technology sector of 44.2x. As one of the stocks that members of Congress are buying at large, it could signal confidence in Palo Alto\u2019s long-term prospects despite recent earnings results not meeting market expectations. As the threat of cyberattacks increases, the company remains well-positioned in a growing industry.\u200b\n\nStory continues\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the biggest owner of shopping malls in the U.S., Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), headquartered in Indiana, represents an opportunity as one of the stocks members of Congress are buying. Congresswoman Victoria Spartz, who is the representative for Indiana\u2019s 5th district, recently disclosed an acquisition of between $50-100K in the company. However, she kept the owner undisclosed. The same day, her child also bought a small stake between $1-15K. The investments indicate that Spartz sees value in SPG despite the challenges the retail real estate sector is currently facing.\u200b\n\nSPG is surprisingly affordable given its relative size, with a market capitalization of $52.130K. The company offers a solid dividend yield of 5.2% and has a P/E ratio of just 21.8x its earnings, below the almost 28x of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nTarget (TGT) an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to recent disclosures, Target (NYSE:TGT) is one of the stocks that members of Congress are buying. Senator Thomas Carper\u2019s spouse purchased shares in the retailer on 16 February, which increased in value by 12% following the release of its earnings results. The company has benefitted from consumers seeking good value items and productivity improvements from a cost reduction program announced last year. Investors were also reassured by Target\u2019s plans to accelerate its store opening plans going forward.\r\n\r\nTarget trades at a P/E ratio of around 21.5x, representing a discount to its main rival,Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has a P/E ratio of approximately 31.3x. This suggests Target may offer better relative value for investors at its current market price.\u200b\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Is Trading Up Today",
        "content": "Why CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Is Trading Up Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 25.2% in the pre-market session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and ARR (annual recurring revenue) beating by a slight margin but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for the next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability.\n\nLastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results.\n\nThese results could signal a shift in sentiment given CrowdStrike's popularity within the cyber security space, especially considering its cloud security capabilities.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 17 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for CrowdStrike and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was about 22 hours ago, when the company dropped 6.8% as stocks declined, with investors likely taking profits. The Nasdaq fell 1.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.9%. Some of the big tech names felt the heat, with Tesla, Netflix, and Microsoft all declining by more than 2%. Notably, iPhone manufacturer Apple was also down nearly 3% following a research report by Counterpoint that suggested a decline in iPhone sales in China in the first six weeks of the year. The weak demand report could signal that the purchasing power of consumers in the region is weakening. Otherwise, we have found no other fundamental or rate-related reasons explaining the broad market decline. It is a week packed with information for investors to digest.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will give updates to Congress on March 6th and 7th, 2024, about the current monetary outlook, recent policy actions, and progress toward bringing inflation back down. Finally, on March 8th, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report nonfarm payrolls for the month of February. The insight gleaned from the economic data and updates during the week could inform the market's outlook on equities and other assets for better or worse. Investors expect the Fed to begin cutting rates this year, with the expectation of the first rate cut as early as the first half of the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 38% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,876.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "Participants\n\nBurt W. Podbere; CFO; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGeorge R.

(Operator Instructions) \r\nI would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer. \r\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \r\nThese forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the company's quarterly and annual reports. \r\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. \r\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nStory continues\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. \r\nCrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records. Record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year-over-year. Record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 66. Record GAAP profitability and record cloud identity and next-gen SIEM ending ARR of greater than $850 million together more than doubling year-over-year. \r\nThese results illustrate CrowdStrike's substantial and widening competitive moat, exceptional business acceleration and validated market leadership. Building on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single platform single-agent technology in cybersecurity that solves use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy and our single AI native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless and natural. The feedback we receive from customers, prospects and partners alike is consistent: eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly. \r\nLeaving stitched together point products and power point platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and lower TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this, showcasing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform. That is ROI. Free is never free. Customers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon Platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. \r\nI'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity unified by our focused mission: we stop breaches. My gratitude to all CrowdStrikers on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. \r\nThe current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters. We expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year. We remain focused on operational excellence while delivering market-leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. \r\nIn contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 Global Threat Report, we unpacked the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include: First, attacks are faster than ever. What took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes in seconds, attack speeds will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts. The cloud is today's battleground for cyberattacks. And third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. Gen AI puts advanced cybercrime trade craft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels. Gen AI will dramatically grow the adversary population. \r\nThe Global Threat Report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily creating one of the world's largest and fastest-growing cyber threat data set. From day 1, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data moat. \r\nEmbedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data, build and train robust preventative and generative models and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity. Our team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data corpus and unique access to cyber's freshest data at the source alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science and engineering expertise together serve as a structural competitive advantage. \r\nAlong with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards. In today's environment of heightened cyber attacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their boards. We regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the back room to the boardroom. This, alongside the severity of the threat landscape makes effective cybersecurity and increasingly mission-critical necessity. \r\nThat said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bazaar. Disjointed point feature copycat products clutter the market attempting to Band-Aid symptoms instead of curing the illness. OS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk, and in many cases, serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelized their stitched together patchwork of point products, masquerading as thinly veiled piecemeal platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, skyrocketing cost and subpar cybersecurity. The outcome is shelfware and sunk costs. ELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coax customers into purchasing nonintegrated point products. It's the organization trapped in these fragmented pseudo platforms riddled with bolt-on point products that are the ones suffering from fatigue. \r\nIn stark juxtaposition, what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solutions and architect the right go-to-market, organizations purchase because they need more, receive more and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this. \r\nFirst, record deal volumes. In Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in deal value, more than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value. Deal counts grew by more than 30% year-over-year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption. Deals with 8 or more modules more than doubled year-over-year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solutions and our frictionless go-to-market motion. \r\nLet me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurity's leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever-expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open. Our single platform is data-centric, AI native and scalable, delivering immediate time to value. \r\nKey wins proved the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. Our recent 7-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale. Falcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor and a next-gen vendor. We eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon Cloud Security as their first CSPM, CIEM and ASPM solution. \r\nAn 8-figure multiyear win in a Fortune 100 business where the Falcon platform displaced 5 different products with recent breaches costing them hundreds of millions and costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tool. They purchased EDR, Next-Gen AV, Identity, biointegrity monitoring and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%. What used to require 5 installs is now done with 1. \r\nThere are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time an organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases. Our application of Gen AI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent and one integrated workflow. \r\nNext, delivering the right solutions our market-leading cloud security, identity protection and next-gen SIEM solutions are in demand because they solve painful customer problems. These businesses collectively are more than doubling year-over-year, each are IPO-able businesses and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. \r\nI'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solutions where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter. With net new ARR growing nearly 200% year-over-year and more than $400 million in ending ARR CrowdStrike, is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave. \r\nHere are a few recent cloud security wins. An 8-figure multiyear win in a hypergrowth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousands. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time. Falcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike Core, CSPM, CIEM, CWP and ASPM. From the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. \r\nA leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities. This large 8-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device, but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest clouds. \r\nA global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large 7-figure deal. The Palo Alto Cloud Security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether. CrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multiproduct, multi-agent multi-console separate platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps, asynchronous alerts and overall fatigue managing cloud security. Falcon's single platform with its integrated cloud security component was a win for the customer. \r\nCustomers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach. It is a compliance and reporting tool. Cloud security has moved beyond CSPM. Customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single agent and agentless cloud security solution. We've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity, ASPM for locating, controlling and securing cloud applications, CWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches. And now we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud. \r\nTurning our cloud security focus to date. We're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology amongst a sea of early start-ups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. \r\nLet me explain. The majority of companies and cloud data security focus on 2 things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart: Runtime data discovery and classification. Data is analyzed, pre and post decryption, enabling precise and instant results; Real time and continuous data visibility, a live view into data risk, not just at rest, but also in motion with LLM powered adaptive policies; Data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration including the data exposed through Gen AI services. Simply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. \r\nBut we'll also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start, already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts. Customer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch. Similar to the days of legacy AV where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud-centric next-gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY '28. With Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application to device to cloud focused on stopping breaches. \r\nNext, let's look at identity protection, which surpassed $300 million in ARR, more than doubling year-over-year. Q4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer adds. With 80% of attacks involving identity vectors, we have made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through nonintegrated, afterthought features or simply lack identity protection altogether. Our identity threat detection and response module remains the market's only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials and secures where identities are actually born, active directory. \r\nWins from the quarter include a 7-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed. Upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slip past their current vendor. Our identity solution delivered in one, not two agents, sets the Falcon platform apart. \r\nAn 8-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a start-up to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent. The customer saw the immediate value of Falcon Identity. Our single agent and single-platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency. \r\nLastly, let's discuss log-scale next-gen SIEM in inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIEM ARR in Q4 and growing over 170% year-over-year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SIEM ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers. \r\nOur next-gen SIEM is quickly emerging as the go-to Splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SIEMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SIEM market, and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering SIEMs, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO and instant time to value. \r\nIn large-scale next-gen SIEM, all CrowdStrike data is already resident, saving the expense and time of data transfer. Customers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI-powered queries or trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIEM Falcon experience. With pipeline already in the hundreds of millions, there's overwhelming interest in LogScale scale next-gen SIEM. \r\nOne of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hypergrowth LogScale next-gen SIEM practice. Together, we closed a 7-figure multiyear next-gen SIEM deal with a large European manufacturer displacing Splunk and Elastic and beating out Azure's Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed. \r\nA major mobile computing company standardized on LogScale next-gen SIEM in a 7-figure multiyear deal replacing legacy SIEM. We competed against Palo Alto's XSIAM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike an even easier choice. \r\nLastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, displacing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a 7-figure deal. In partnership with E&Y and their global LogScale next-gen SIEM practice, this customer grew their SIEM use cases by bringing in security and IT data more than before, retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches. \r\nLogScale next-gen SIEM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win. Our LogScale next-gen SIEM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity with the businesses of all sizes. I can confidently say LogScale next-gen SIEM is one of the fastest-growing SIEM solutions on the market today. \r\nOur pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments Falcon for IT excitement is palpable. Our customers are also excited about the gen AI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will save hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI. \r\nThe third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to-market. I'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced FalconFlex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want when they want over the course of a multiyear subscription term. FalconFlex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger land and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. \r\nA recent noteworthy FalconFlex deal was a multimillion dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged FalconFlex to go all in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT hygiene products, point cloud products and legacy DLP products. The right platform solutions and go-to-market make a partner ecosystem's leading choice. \r\nSome partnership highlights include: accelerating momentum with Dell. Since announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings such as their own MDR service on Falcon. \r\nOur MSSP business is growing by triple digits year-over-year, fueled by the right technology, strategy and partners. MSSPs increasingly want the platform, not part of the platform, to power cybersecurity transformation. MSSPs are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity. \r\nOur AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales the AWS Marketplace continues to be one of the fastest-growing routes to market. A vast majority of our marketplace business also transacts through resellers and SIs, where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed and end customer value. \r\nThe Falcon platform is validated, tested and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Falcon and our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant. Our placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest in ability to execute and furthest to the right in completeness of vision in this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile. Second, the Forester wave for cloud security placed CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market, ranking highest for vision and innovation. \r\nIn conclusion, CrowdStrike's single agent, single unified data-centric platform and our mission to stop breaches sets us apart. Since starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud. We pioneered AI for cybersecurity, and we've quickly become the de facto security platform that disrupts, displaces and consolidates other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the crowd. We are cybersecurity's community. \r\nWhen cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is the required skill set. In the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In SoCs across every vertical and geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system. It's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, CrowdStrike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security, where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily. It's CrowdStrike that created cybersecurity's first dedicated Gen AI stock assistant to make every user a power user. It's CrowdStrike where more than 0.5 million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches. The technology, the crowd, the mission, this is what makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity's definitive platform. \r\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Burt.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. \r\nFor the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line. Operating income grew 86% year-over-year to reach a record $660.3 million or 22% of revenue. And net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million or $3.09 per diluted share. \r\nFree cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to reach $938.2 million or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past 4 quarters and full fiscal year in less than 5 years following our IPO. \r\nOur achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10x from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%. We continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flank the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next 5 to 7 years. \r\nMoving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. \r\nWhile companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon platform. This is evidenced by, first, the number of deals with 8 or more modules more than doubling year-over-year in Q4. Second, subscription customers where 5 or more, 6 or more and 7 or more modules growing to 64%, 43% and 27% of subscription customers, respectively. Third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than 580. And finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over 250 in Q4. \r\nWe finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners. We are landing bigger with new customers on average adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98%, and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY '24 quarters, Net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2 and 122% in Q1. \r\nLooking into FY '25, a we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate within plus or minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S., 16% from Europe, Middle East and Africa, 10% from the Asia Pacific region and 6% from all other markets. \r\nTotal gross margin increased by 282 basis points year-over-year to reach 78% and subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 291 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform as well as our continued investments in data center and workload optimization. \r\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million or 53% of revenue compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year. Our strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year-over-year to reach a record $213.1 million, and operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares. \r\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million. Free cash flow reached a record $283.0 million or 33% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis. \r\nBefore I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business including larger deal sizes, increased win rates and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging, and therefore, the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent challenging macro backdrop. \r\nSecond, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR in Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. \r\nThird, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY '25 as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go-to-market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY '25. \r\nNext, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY '25 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest income and expense, CapEx and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. \r\nMoving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 million to $190.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $220.4 million to $223.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90, utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis. \r\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 to $3,989.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 million and $913.0 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97. \r\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nOkay. Great. Congrats to the team on a strong finish to the year. George, maybe for you. I think the number that sticks out the most to me from the quarter is the $850 million in ARR from maybe what I'll call platform products. So the question is, can you just talk about the competitive landscape in a couple of those areas like cloud security and SIEM. I mean, definitely a rising tide in some of those markets, but also some good competitors. What do you think is giving CrowdStrike a right to win in those markets?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, thanks, Saket. Obviously, a key part of our success has been that all of the modules are platform, which is really a key driver. And when I started the company, it was really about creating this data platform that allowed us to ingest data at scale and then create multiple use cases. And really, what you're seeing is many, many years of hard work that allow us to solve use cases beyond just core endpoint protection. So when we think about cloud security, customers are really looking to rationalize the alphabet soup of cloud products that are out there. And they're looking, not only for posture management, but runtime protection, and they want it all integrated into a data platform. \r\nSo I think given what we've done and some of the acquisitions, including now Flow, we are obviously well positioned in that area and a lot of interest from our customers, and we've seen a lot of success. When we think about the SIEM market and more -- maybe more importantly, the legacy SIEM market, customers are just frustrated with the existing technologies, the cost structure around those. And what they're looking for really is a data platform like CrowdStrike and now that LogScale's natively integrated into the product, it's a better way to give them the outcome they want, which is faster results, better overall outcomes and a lower TCO. So I think it's this data concept that we've been talking about for many years that everyone now is starting to see the fruits of our labor and how we can solve use case well beyond just endpoint protection. Burt?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. So I would agree, George. I think at the end of the day, for us, when we're thinking about the different products that are in our portfolio. It's really about the platform. We sell the platform regardless of what are the products that are in the platform. They all kind of work off of each other, and we're just out there solving as many outcomes as we possibly can.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan.\n\nBrian Lee Essex\n\nGreat to see the strong results from the team. George, you articulated a few thoughts on consolidation and pricing in your prepared remarks. But I wanted to ask a little more directly a maybe follow-up to Saket's question both for you and Burt. One of the other vendors in the space has talked about a strategy of platformization. So maybe with that in context, how does this impact your go-to-market and pricing?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, thanks, Brian, as you might imagine, I heard a lot about platformization over the last week. To me, it's kind of a made up (inaudible) term. But what I believe our competitors are talking about is bundling discounting and giving products away for free, which is nothing new. In software and security software, it's been done for the last 30 years. So when we think about what we've seen in the past with other competitors. We know free isn't free. And what customers are saying is more consoles, more point products masquerading as platforms create fatigue in their environment. \r\nAnd one of the things, again, that we've been focused on is that single-agent architecture, a single platform, single console that allows us to stop the breach, but more importantly, drive down the operational cost and supply many use cases or solve many use cases that are out there. So I've been around the block for a bit. I've seen this movie of wrap and roll and bundling together with multiple products that were acquired. And last time I saw that, I was at McAfee. So I don't know, Burt, do you have anything to add to that?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. I think, George, look, at the end of the day, we sell on value. And we've never been a company that's done deep discounting. We've never been a company that has increased our prices to get more ARR. That's not us. And at the end of the day, for us, we're here to help customers get the greatest amount of outcomes at the lowest TCO, period. And to George's point, free is not free and good is not good enough.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Sandler.\n\nRobbie David Owens\n\nI was wondering if you could address the modest step-up in billings duration. After a year of compressing durations, your total billings outgrew your short-term billings, and it does appear that customers are committing for longer contracts. Wondering if that's a function of your consolidated platform or another dynamic in the market?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nRob, so I think it's a couple of things. One, for sure, it's about the platform. But second, Q4 is -- historically, we've seen a lot more of the multiyear deals. We also see more renewals in Q4 as well. But billings in general, remember, it's a noisy metric, right? It's heavily influenced by duration and timing of deals within the given quarter. But -- and having said that, at the end of the day, we do manage the business to ARR. And that's the one that we focus in on. Billings for us is just an aftermath. You're right. It was a strong billings quarter, but that's not really how we run the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist.\n\nJoel P. Fishbein\n\nCongrats on the great execution as well. George, just a follow-up for you on the data market or the DLP market and congrats on the acquisition of Flow. Just curious how that will be integrated. You didn't really mention how big that is for you guys, but obviously, a very big market that is ripe for disruption. And maybe talk about the competitive dynamics of that market as well.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nSure. Well, we're excited about this because not only do we get the classification of data, but we also get the runtime protection in the cloud. So it's a perfect fit for our data protection module. And again, what I talked about in the prepared remarks was that there's a lot of similarities to what I saw when I started the company in legacy AV to legacy DLP. I don't even like the term DLP, we call it data protection because It's really about how data flows and data in motion, not only in a company's organization, but through all of their cloud and all of the applications. \r\nSo I think it's a perfect fit. We're excited about the team. We're excited about the technology. That will be integrated, of course, as part of our platform. We spend a lot of time on that, making sure the customer has got the right user experience. And we'll get this closed -- this acquisition closed out in the next couple of weeks and then we'll be heads down with the integration. But so far, so good on our data protection module. We've got some wins there and a tremendous amount of interest in replacing the legacy DLP technologies.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Wells Fargo.\n\nAndrew James Nowinski\n\nIt is a really amazing quarter again, particularly in light of some of the noise that's been in the market. So I wanted to ask about the expanded partnerships with Dell that you announced today and also about the -- I think, the Pax8 partnership that you announced at your user conference last year. I guess, first, how did both partners contribute to results in the quarter relative to your expectations? And then second, have you factored in the contribution from those partners into your FY '25 outlook?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nYes, I'll take the first part, and I'll turn it over to Burt. So we obviously are very excited about the Dell partnership. I'll start with them. I talked about that earlier. And really, we're in the early innings. We're winning deals, large enterprise all the way down to SMB, taking advantage of their reach and their go-to-market motion. So still early days, and we've already put up some big numbers from that partnership. \r\nWhen we look at Pax8 and the like, again, it's still early days, but we've seen tremendous success, particularly down market in the SMB. And what customers are looking for, even the smaller customers are looking to solve big problems. They can't be hit by ransomware or they can't have an impact to their business. So it's a perfect model for us to get to those SMBs. And it's, like I said, early days, but tremendous results so far. Burt?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes. So I think that -- we're very excited about both partnerships with Dell and Pax8, they represent additional routes to market, but it's still early days on both of them, as George had mentioned. But they're one of many routes to market. We do believe that they're going to bring deals to us, and we're excited to have them on board as partners.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America.\n\nTal Liani\n\nSo one of -- some of the -- we had discussions this kind of past few weeks about the pricing environment of the XDR market and the ability to offset this with add-on modules. And the question is -- you touched on it, but I want to ask, do you feel -- the contribution of Microsoft and Cortex from Palo Alto and others, do you feel their impact on pricing of individual components off your package? And is the story -- is there a story about price compression of each individual components offset by the bundle or that you just don't see the XDR pricing pressure that Palo Alto was talking about.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, again, I mean I can -- I try to focus on what we've been able to do. And as the leader in the space, we've been solving problems for a long time. And when we look about -- we look at the impact that ransomware and some of these very prominent breaches have had, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for companies. So to buy a platform that has the capabilities to stop breaches is really what customers are looking at. And when we think about sort of one-off modules or things of that nature, for us, we're looking at the total package and the solution of what we put together. \r\nAnd of course, it's a competitive environment, but you have to have a competitive product, you have to have the right level of innovation, and you have to have the right go-to-market motion, which we talked about in some of the prepared remarks. So it has been competitive. It has -- will be competitive. But at the end of the day, what we're finding is that customers want the right outcome. And we've seen that free is not free, and we see that good enough is not good enough. And I think customers are smart enough to realize the difference between price and total cost. And that's what we've been able to show with every dollar spent on CrowdStrike is a $6 return on their investment. And we're going to continue to deliver value and outcomes for customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham..\n\nAlexander Henderson\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. So first thing you ever said to me, George, was that you're a platform, not an endpoint company. I think you've been proving it with high alacrity over the last year. \r\nWith the comments coming in about the platformization. It sounds like the response that you're having here is that the companies that are trying to do that are really just offering bundles of products, but they're not truly integrated. Your platform is based off of cloud native micro services, API-driven. And I think if you were to talk to the degree to which you integrate any acquisition into that platform, it would be radically different than what we're hearing or seeing from some of the other players. \r\nSo can you talk about why the micro service cloud-native architecture in a single platform integrated upfront is the way to go and how hard it is for companies that are trying to merge disparate packages into a platform that wasn't designed as a platform from the get-go because I think, ultimately, that's the key differentiator here. And I would think that with the acquisition of Flow, you'll be able to integrate it much more rapidly because it's API-driven, because it's micro service-based. Can you talk to that?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nYes. Sure, I can. Thanks, Alex. It's a great question. And I do remember our early conversations finally, and you're absolutely right about being the platform for cybersecurity when I started the company. \r\nSo when we think about architecture, architecture does matter and really what we've created is a very data-centric architecture that allows us to get data at scale into our platform, leverage our AI and then create the outcomes. It's that collect once, use many. We have a single platform. Our competitors have many other platforms as they call them. We have a single agent. Our competitors have 5, 6, 7, 8 agents depending on the competitors. \r\nSo when we look at our architecture, it was really designed from the beginning to solve the problems of today and the future problems. And the result of that is ease of use, the outcome that a customer is looking for, stopping breaches and lowering the cost, and future proofing what they want. I've -- in a prior life, I've been involved in companies that acquired a lot of products. And I can tell you, it is near impossible to stitch all this stuff together, particularly at the agent level unless you're very diligent about it. \r\nAnd I can tell you from a CrowdStrike perspective, we've been very diligent about our acquisitions, as you've seen, and thoughtful on the pricing. But also what's important to realize is that we bought products and we really haven't sold some of them for the better part of 18 months because we wanted to focus on the integration, things like identity. And now we see the fruits of our labor. So it's this focused, long-term diligent approach to our acquisitions, I think, that have helped us because we started with a very innovative cloud-native platform from the beginning.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Roger Boyd of UBS.\n\nRoger Foley Boyd\n\nGreat. Congrats on a really strong end of the year. I wanted to talk about Charlotte. The customers that we've spoken to that were part of that early access program sound pretty positive on both what the product can do today as well as the pipeline and where it could go in the future. George, you said a couple of positive stats around automation. Any updated view on your ability to monetize the Charlotte product or the time line to monetization from here?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, yes, that is the goal. We already have paying customers in Charlotte. We just released it. So the good news for us, and I think the good news for our customers, is they see the value and they're willing to pay for it. Obviously, we're in the early innings of this. But the way we've architected it as a foundational component of our platform, it allows us to create expertise around different areas of the platform as well as automation, leveraging the native automation capabilities that we have. \r\nSo our overall goal, again, is how do you drive automation in the SoC, how do you modernize the SoC, and how do you take the collective wisdom of CrowdStrike and its years of knowledge in fast categories and bring that to bear for customers big and small? And so far, we've gotten the response from customers where they understand the time savings and the value that it can bring. So more to come on this. Obviously, we just GA-ed it over the last week or so. But overall, I'm very encouraged by what we're hearing and seeing from customers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nI'll offer my congrats as well, guys. Burt, your new ARR commentary was helpful for Q1. I'm curious, this time last year, I believe you talked about flat net new ARR growth for fiscal '24. And obviously, I think you guys did about 6% this year. Any just sort of like directional guardrails you give us from a full year perspective in terms of just thinking about it from a net new perspective?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nSo with respect to ARR, obviously, we don't guide to it. But we have talked about in the past where we've started the year in Q1 and build from there. And that's kind of really all I can really comment on ARR. You can kind of infer where we're going with our guide. And -- but at the end of the day, our guide -- the methodology has remained consistent, and that's how we think about it.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nSo it sounds like -- it sounds like your commentary on linearity, you would expect Q1 to be sort of the low point for net new growth -- or net new dollars for the year?\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nYes, That would be accurate.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim.\n\nJohn Stephen DiFucci\n\nListen, as everybody said, these are really impressive results, no matter how you look at it, but especially as compared to others out there. I'd like to ask another question about the past is -- I know, George, you think, but that's why the past is the past. It's great. It's great to see. But I'd like to ask another question about the future. \r\nI know Charlotte AI is the sexy new product. It's everybody -- are you an AI winner or are you a loser, I mean. And we'll see how that develops. But given your lightweight agent and all the data you collect or even could collect, it just seems that Falcon for IT could be a whole new world for you, which might make it harder given it might perhaps be a different buyer, but certainly worth it. I guess how should we think about the development of this product going forward, given your -- I know it just was generally available too, but I'm sure you've had early conversations with customers.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nWell, I've got to tell you that the customer excitement around Falcon for IT is off the charts when we talked about it at Falcon and now that it's generally available. Customers are looking for a better solution in this area. And one of the things that we found is that the security team has been solving a lot of IT problems and challenges for IT for a long time, and we really needed to carve out a home for IT. So when you look at some of our competitors in that market, it's -- obviously, it's a pretty big market, but having a single agent and the ability to actually solve IT problems, which many of our customers were doing already, is fantastic. \r\nSo again, early days, but the feedback and the interest is off the charts for Falcon for IT, and it goes to the heart of how we built the platform. To collect data, it doesn't have to be security data. It can be almost any data related to either our agent first-party data or now third-party data we can ingest. And that solves many use cases beyond what we originally came to market with. So I think the sky is the limit there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to George Kurtz for closing remarks. Sir?\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nSo I want to thank all of you for your time today. We appreciate your interest and certainly look forward to seeing you at our upcoming investor events. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) shares took a huge hit after its fiscal second-quarter earnings, which were released on Feb. 20. This was probably overdone, so the stock now looks cheap. This analysis will explain why using a simple free cash flow yield model to value its common shares.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with PANW.\n\nThe stock fell from $366.16 before the earnings report to a low of $262.01 the next day. It has since recuperated to $316.15 by Wednesday, Feb. 28. But it could still be worth more.\n\nI estimate the stock is worth at least 18% more at over $376 per share. This is based on the company's free cash flow margin guidance, analysts' revenue estimates and a simple FCF yield model.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' FCF and SaaS subscriptions\n\nPalo Alto Networks makes money selling cybersecurity software-as-service modules (slightly over 80% of total revenue) and the rest in hardware and networking products.\n\nFor the quarter ending Jan. 31, its revenue was up 19%. Analysts had been expecting slightly less than that. So that should have been a high point for the stock.\n\nBut the market's disappointment came when management said its adjusted free cash flow was only $654 million compared to $685 million a year earlier. Moreover, in the prior quarter, its adjusted FCF was much higher at $1.48 billion.\n\nThe company's history of quarterly adjusted free cash flow can be seen in the table below. It shows that FCF is very seasonal most of it comes during its fiscal first quarter ending Nov. 30. Why Is Palo Alto Networks So Cheap?\n\nSource: Company presentations and Hake estimates.\n\nAs a result, it is best to just look at trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow. This shows that the quarterly changes are mostly negative except for the first fiscal quarter.\n\nBut the year-over-year changes in trailing 12-month adjusted FCF is very strong. This can be seen in the chart below. Note that the changes are very stable. Why Is Palo Alto Networks So Cheap?\n\nSource: Hake\n\nThis is because typically most corporate clients will renew their SaaS subscriptions once a year. The quarterly changes usually relate to new subscriptions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt turns out most of the company's renewals occur before the end of the calendar year in November. That is because nobody wants to make corporate decisions during December as vacations and travel take over itineraries.\n\nSo the bottom line is the company is very profitable on a trailing 12-month basis.\n\nFCF margins are strong\n\nPalo Alto Networks' profitability from a free cash flow margin standpoint (i.e., FCF/revenue) is very high and relatively stable. This can be seen looking at its adjusted free cash flow margins on a trailing 12-month basis. Why Is Palo Alto Networks So Cheap?\n\nSource: Hake.\n\nThe chart above shows that, although declining, its FCF margins over the past 12 months have been high at around 39% to 45%.\n\nMoreover, management itself said it expects full fiscal year adjusted FCF margins to be between 38% and 39%. I suspect they are being conservative, so I estimated 40% for the fiscal year ending July 31.\n\nBased on analysts' revenue estimate of $8 billion for the year ending July 31, that leads to an estimate, using a 40% FCF margin. of $3.20 billion.\n\nHowever, if we look at analysts' revenue estimates for $9.16 billion for next year, the average over the next 12 months is about $8.50 billion. Therefore, by the end of calendar 2024, the company will be on a run rate for $8.60 billion in revenue and $3.43 billion in adjusted free cash flow.\n\nWe can use that to set a price target for the stock\n\nSetting a price target using FCF yield\n\nOne way to value the stock is to assume it pays out its free cash flow as a dividend. For example, if we estimate that one-third of adjusted free cash flow is paid as a dividend, that would be:\n\n1/3 x $3.43 billion (adjusted FCF estimate in the next 12 months) = $1.14 billion\n\nThat is because typically tech companies will leave some of its FCF to buy back shares as well as accumulate cash to use in acquisitions or debt reduction.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has no long-term debt and $3.37 billion in cash and securities. As such, it could afford to pay out as much as 50% of adjusted free cash flow as a dividend.\n\nBut, just to be conservative, let's say it pays out 35% of the $3.43 billion in estimated free cash flow. That means its dividend will cost the company $1.2 billion (i.e., 0.35 x $3.43 billion).\n\nHow will the stock market value this? I submit that the market will give the stock at least a 1% dividend yield. So here is how that works out:\n\n$1.2 billion in dividends / 0.01 = $120 billion market valuation $120 billion / $101 billion market value today = 19% potential upside\n\nIn other words, the stock will be worth at least 19% higher, or $376.22 per share.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe bottom line is Palo Alto Networks has a stable free cash flow outlook. This means the stock can be valued much higher.\n\nIn fact, on the upper limit if the stock were to have a 0.80% dividend yield, it could be worth $150 billion (i.e., $1.2 billion/ 0.008), which is 48.50% higher than today's price.\n\nAnalysts tend to agree with me. For example, AnaChart, a new sell-side stock analyst site that surveys analysts, shows the average of 38 analysts' price targets is $359.19. That implies an upside of over 13.60% from here.\n\nThe bottom line is Palo Alto Networks is likely to retrace its recent tumble.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "'She's such a genius': RFK Jr. jokingly calls Nancy Pelosi 'an incredible investor' for making millions from well-timed stock trades \u2014 here are the Pelosis' 2 big bets right now\n\nThe debate over whether politicians should be permitted to trade stocks has been contentious. However, the position of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on this matter is unequivocally clear.\n\nDuring a recent cryptocurrency conference in Denver, an audience member asked RFK Jr. about his view on stock trading by politicians, specifically mentioning Democratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The former House Speaker has received attention lately for her major wins in the market.\n\nDon't miss\n\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation Can I collect my dead spouse's Social Security and my own at the same time?

It has seen a 34% increase over the last 12 months, beating the S&P 500's already impressive 25% return during the same timeframe.\n\nWhile past performance does not guarantee future results, those interested in emulating Pelosi\u2019s investment strategy might want to pay attention to her two most recent trades, as reported by trading data platform Unusual Whales, which also serves as the data provider for the NANC ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia\n\nShortly before the holiday season, Pelosi disclosed through a filing that her husband, venture capitalist Paul Pelosi, bought 50 call options on Nvidia (NVDA) with an expiry date of Dec. 20, 2024 and a strike price of $120. The reported transaction value was between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nA call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a specified price within a certain time period. Typically, the value of a call option tends to rise when the price of the underlying asset increases.\n\nIt appears that Pelosi\u2019s bet was well-placed. Since the reported transaction date of Nov. 22, 2023, Nvidia shares have soared by 76%.\n\nArtificial intelligence has emerged as a prominent trend in the tech sector.

On Feb. 21, Paul Pelosi bought another 20 call options on Palo Alto Networks with the same strike price and expiration date for a total value of between $100,001 and $250,000.\n\nShares of Palo Alto Networks fell after the company lowered its full-year guidance in its latest earnings report. Management now expects full-year revenue to be between $7.95 billion to $8 billion, a decrease from the previous guidance of between $8.15 billion and $8.2 billion. Additionally, total billings are now guided at $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion for the year, compared with the previous projected range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.\n\nDespite this recent downturn, PANW stock is still up 55% over the past year.\n\nWhat to read next\n\n'The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' \u2014 here's what he likes for protection 'We're looking at a downsized America': Kevin O'Leary warns any new house, car and lifestyle you enjoy will be significantly 'smaller' \u2014 here's what he means and how you can prepare Bill Burr once complained to Joe Rogan that his bank took $28 every month 'for no reason' \u2014 now the government is taking action on these frustrating fees.

CrowdStrike Total Revenue\n\nUnsurprisingly, this was another great quarter for CrowdStrike with revenue up 32.6% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $59.32 million quarter on quarter, a solid improvement from the $54.39 million increase in Q3 2024. This is a sign of slight re-acceleration of growth.\n\nNext quarter's guidance suggests that CrowdStrike is expecting revenue to grow 30.5% year on year to $904 million, slowing down from the 42% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. For the upcoming financial year, management expects revenue to be $3.96 billion at the midpoint, growing 29.5% year on year compared to the 36.3% increase in FY2024.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know that we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills. CrowdStrike's free cash flow came in at $283 million in Q4, up 35.1% year on year. CrowdStrike Free Cash Flow\n\nCrowdStrike has generated $938.2 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, an eye-popping 30.7% of revenue. This robust FCF margin stems from its asset-lite business model, scale advantages, and strong competitive positioning, giving it the option to return capital to shareholders or reinvest in its business while maintaining a healthy cash balance.\n\nKey Takeaways from CrowdStrike's Q4 Results\n\nThis was a strong quarter for CrowdStrike, with the company beating slightly on revenue and ARR but very convincingly on operating profit. Keeping with that theme, while forward guidance for next quarter and the full year were only slightly above expectations, non-GAAP EPS guidance was more convincingly ahead, showing better-than-expected profitability. Lastly, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) warned of weakness in security spending a few weeks ago when it reported earnings, sending waves of caution across the sector. Cybersecurity peers that reported after Palo Alto put up mixed results, which kept investors on edge for CrowdStrike's results. The stock is up 16.5% after reporting and currently trades at $347 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in CrowdStrike right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

        "title": "From Zero to Hero: 3 Turnaround Stocks for a Portfolio Revival",
        "content": "Some of the greatest opportunities can be found in turnaround stocks \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a large, respected stock that\u2019s down temporarily.\n\nLook at\u00a0Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), for example. A few weeks ago, the cybersecurity giant gapped from about $360 to a low of $260. All after the company dropped its revenue and billings guidance for fiscal year 2024.\n\nBut the pullback was overkill.\u00a0For one, analysts said the\u00a0pullback was an overreaction to a misunderstanding. Two, the stock managed to catch and hold support at its 200-day moving average, while becoming oversold on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R. And three, cybersecurity issues were still making major headlines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA few days later, PANW jumped from $260 to a high of nearly $328. The best part \u2014 there are plenty of turnaround stocks just like PANW. In fact, I spot opportunities just like these every day. Here are three to consider, for example.\n\nCameco (CCJ) CCJ Stock: Hand in long yellow glove holding a chunk of uranium material\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/RHJPhtotoandilustration\n\nUranium prices are at 16-year highs thanks to massive supply and demand issues. All of which is great news for uranium stocks, like\u00a0Cameco (NYSE:CCJ).\n\nOn one side, we have\u00a0one of the world\u2019s biggest producers of uranium, Kazatomprom warning it \u201cwill produce\u00a0only 80% of its permitted maximum uranium output allowed under Kazakh subsoil usage contracts, instead of the previously announced 90% level, due to difficulties procuring sufficient levels of sulfuric acid,\u201d\u00a0as noted by S&P Global.\n\nOn the other side, demand for uranium is exploding, especially with global leaders agreeing to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050. American Nuclear Society said:\n\n\u201cA major factor behind the bullish outlook is that the demand for uranium in Western markets (excluding Russia)\u2014currently at approximately 200 million pounds\u2014is about 40 million pounds greater than the radioactive metal\u2019s supply. Furthermore, market analysts project an average supply deficit of 35 million pounds per year over the next decade.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs we all learned in Econ 101, little supply and growing demand equals higher prices. All of which is great news for turnaround stocks, like Cameco. If you pull up a one-year chart of CCJ, you can clearly see CCJ is now consolidating at support, and is just starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.\n\nSource: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also look at\u00a0Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), which is just starting to pivot from double-bottom support just under $14 a share. It\u2019s also starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI and MACD, as well. From its current price of $15.44, I\u2019d like to see it initially refill its bearish gap around $17.50 a share. For one, investors are flocking to gold, which last traded at $2,083.\n\nTwo, gold demand is expected to hit another record this year, as central banks continue to buy the safe haven, according to the\u00a0World Gold Council.\u00a0\u201cCentral-bank buying maintained a breakneck pace, with annual net purchases of 1,037 tons last year, just 45 tons shy of the record set in 2022, the WGC said in the report. It expects central-bank buying to top 500 tons this year,\u201d added Bloomberg.\n\nEven\u00a0millionaires and billionaires are flocking to gold over concerns of dollar devaluation and the potential for economic collapse. Such comforting news, huh?\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can look at hot turnaround stocks, like\u00a0Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) again, too.\n\nThe last time I mentioned ALB, it traded at around $120 on February 26.\u00a0At the time, I noted, \u201cwith cuts to its demand forecast, falling lithium prices, and plummeting electric vehicle sales now priced in, the stock is ridiculously oversold. And, as other investors run scared from ALB on all that news, it\u2019s time to buy the blood in the streets.\u201d\n\nAs hoped, fear is giving way to greed, as ALB shares get bid higher on speculation that lithium prices are finally bottoming out. That would explain why ALB just hit a high of $142.80.\n\nHelping,\u00a0Sociedad y Quimica (NYSE:SQM) CEO Ricardo Ramos expects for lithium prices to remain stable this year, and for sales volumes to improve.\n\nEven better, Australian lithium company\u00a0Pilbara (OTCMKTS:PILBF) just said it\u2019s seeing buying interest again, too.\u00a0\u201cAll our customers, for avoidance of doubt, are taking their product and, in some cases, asking for more,\u201d said Pilbara Minerals\u2019 Managing Director Dale Henderson, as noted by Bloomberg.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Fantastic Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Putting aside Nvidia is practically impossible, considering nearly every large technology company in America seems to be racing to buy its data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Plus, Nvidia stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 index in 2023 with a 239% gain, and it's already up another 61% in 2024.\n\nBut the AI industry is expanding quickly, and a number of other opportunities warrant attention, so let's forget Nvidia for a moment.\n\nPalo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is the world's largest cybersecurity company, and it's applying AI across its product portfolio to deliver advanced protection against modern threats. DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), on the other hand, is an under-the-radar cloud services provider emerging as an on-ramp to the AI revolution for small and mid-size businesses.\n\nHere's why investors might do well to buy both stocks right now.\n\n1. Palo Alto Networks\n\nCyberthreats are a growing concern in the corporate world. Data breaches not only have severe financial consequences, but they also shatter the trust between companies and their customers. Attacks are increasing in sophistication with each passing year, and malicious actors are even using tools like generative AI to trick employees into handing over sensitive information through realistic phishing emails and phone calls.\n\nAutomation has never been more important to cybersecurity, because it's impossible to train every employee within an organization to be an expert. Palo Alto Networks says 93% of security operations centers still rely on manual, human-led processes, and the workload is so heavy that 23% of security incidents are left uninvestigated. That creates enormous vulnerabilities.\n\nPalo Alto offers three cybersecurity platforms addressing cloud security, network security, and security operations. It's weaving AI into all of them, including its new Cortex XSIAM security operations product. For one customer, it resolves up to 90% of security incidents autonomously, with no human input required. XSIAM was released a little over one year ago, and it has already amassed a sales pipeline worth $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto is the world's largest cybersecurity company, and it plans to use that scale to crush its competitors. Many large organizations use cybersecurity tools from multiple providers based on their needs, but Palo Alto wants its customers to ditch competing products in favor of using its products exclusively.\n\nTo achieve this, Palo Alto will offer customers lengthy fee-free periods so they can integrate its software at no cost, which should encourage them to make the switch once their contracts are up with competing providers. A customer who uses all three of Palo Alto's platforms gets a lifetime value 40 times greater than a customer using just one, so this could drive significant long-term growth.\n\nOn the other hand, this strategy will lead to a short-term dip in Palo Alto's revenue and billings growth, which is why its stock suffered a sharp fall recently and now trades 16% below its all-time high. Nevertheless, the company still forecasts record revenue of up to $8 billion in fiscal 2024 (ending July 31).\n\nTherefore, the dip in its stock price might be a great entry point for long-term investors. Once Palo Alto begins reaping the rewards of its strategy, it could unlock a new phase of growth.\n\n2. DigitalOcean\n\nThe world's largest cloud platforms, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, are spending billions of dollars to build data centers for AI development, mainly using chips from Nvidia. While they are focused on serving large organizations and cashed-up AI developers, DigitalOcean is making sure small and medium-sized businesses aren't left behind.\n\nDigitalOcean is a provider of cloud services that help these businesses store data, host websites, and develop software. It offers cheap and transparent pricing, highly personalized service, and mountains of educational material to help customers maximize their output. It's an ideal platform for start-ups and businesses with less than 500 employees that can't afford in-house technical teams to manage their cloud infrastructure.\n\nLast year, DigitalOcean spent $111 million to acquire Paperspace, a data center operator focused on delivering AI infrastructure at affordable prices. It offers the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) -- including the industry-leading H100 from Nvidia -- up to 70% cheaper than Microsoft Azure. Paperspace charges customers by the second with no lock-in contracts, and its narrow business model allows it to maintain a slim cost structure compared to the cloud giants. Those features lead to lower prices for the end user.\n\nDigitalOcean estimates its opportunity in the small and medium-sized business cloud services industry will be worth $114 billion in 2024, which could swell to $213 billion by 2027. However, AI could dramatically expand that addressable market into the trillions of dollars, considering Wall Street predicts the technology could add somewhere between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the coming decade.\n\nDigitalOcean could soon become the go-to platform for these businesses who want to access AI. At the end of 2023, the company had only $730 million in annual recurring revenue, so it has barely scratched the surface of its addressable market, let alone the AI opportunity.\n\nDigitalOcean stock remains 71% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy of 2021. Its valuation was a little unrealistic back then, but the steep drop may give investors a great long-term entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ:PANW) Returns On Capital Are Heading Higher",
        "content": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Palo Alto Networks:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.074 = US$778m \u00f7 (US$18b - US$7.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).\n\nTherefore, Palo Alto Networks has an ROCE of 7.4%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Software industry average of 7.7%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Palo Alto Networks' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Palo Alto Networks .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThe fact that Palo Alto Networks is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 7.4% on its capital. In addition to that, Palo Alto Networks is employing 174% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, both common traits of a multi-bagger.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother thing to note, Palo Alto Networks has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 42%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Palo Alto Networks' ROCE\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that Palo Alto Networks has managed to break into profitability and is continuing to reinvest in its business. Since the stock has returned a staggering 287% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nOne final note, you should learn about the  2 warning signs  we've spotted with Palo Alto Networks (including 1 which is potentially serious) .\n\nWhile Palo Alto Networks isn't earning the highest return, check out this freelist of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) expects artificial intelligence (AI) to become a key growth driver for the company in the long run, which is not surprising as this technology is expected to play a central role in shoring up cyber defenses and help organizations protect their networks from bad actors. However, a closer look at the company's latest quarterly results indicates it has a lot of work to do before it can make the most of the AI-related cybersecurity opportunity.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence forecasts that generative AI-driven cybersecurity spending could jump to $3.1 billion in 2027 from just $9 million in 2022. By 2032, generative AI-based cybersecurity spending is predicted to touch nearly $14 billion. This explains why Palo Alto management discussed the company's AI-related potential in detail on the latest earnings conference call, suggesting that this technology could drive healthy growth in the company's revenue by 2030.\n\nHowever, the fact that Palo Alto stock fell a whopping 22% following the release of its fiscal 2024 second-quarter results (for the three months ended Jan. 31, 2024) on Feb. 20 cannot be ignored. Let's see why that was the case and whether AI could indeed help Palo Alto regain investor confidence.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' guidance cut spooked investors\n\nPalo Alto's fiscal Q2 revenue increased 19% year over year to $2 billion, while billings increased at a slower pace of 16% to $2.35 billion. The cybersecurity specialist's non-GAAP (adjusted) net income was up 39% year over year to $1.46 per share. The numbers were better than analysts' expectations of $1.30 per share in earnings on revenue of $1.97 billion.\n\nHowever, Palo Alto couldn't top its strong quarterly performance with a robust outlook. It predicts revenue to increase at a slower pace of 13% to 15% in the current quarter to a range of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion. Consensus estimates were looking for $2.04 billion in revenue from Palo Alto in the current quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Palo Alto sees its billings increasing just 2% to 4% in the fiscal third quarter to between $2.3 billion and $2.35 billion, lower than the $2.62 billion consensus estimate. Given that Palo Alto's billings are an indicator of its future revenue, the market didn't take kindly to the fact that the company reduced its full-year billings guidance.\n\nPalo Alto now expects fiscal 2024 billings to land between $10.1 billion and $10.2 billion, lower than the prior estimated range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion, and up just 10% to 11% over fiscal 2023. It has also reduced its revenue expectation to $7.95 billion to $8 billion from the earlier range of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion. Based on its latest forecast, Palo Alto's revenue would increase between 15% and 16% in the current fiscal year.\n\nThere are a few silver linings\n\nFor a stock that's trading at an expensive 13 times sales as compared to its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 8.8, it wasn't surprising to see investors hitting the panic button following Palo Alto's guidance cut. However, the positive takeaway from Palo Alto's latest earnings report was an increase in its remaining performance obligations (RPO), a metric that refers to the total value of the company's future contracts, and which, according to CEO Nikesh Arora, is a better indicator of future growth potential.\n\nMore specifically, Palo Alto's RPO jumped 22% year over year last quarter to $10.8 billion, outpacing the growth in its revenue and billings. Meanwhile, the annualized recurring revenue (ARR) from Palo Alto's next-generation security (NGS) offerings -- which include the Prisma cloud security platform and the AI-powered Cortex platform that provides endpoint detection and response, security automation, and external threat protection -- increased an impressive 50% year over year to $3.5 billion last quarter.\n\nPalo Alto management predicts that AI adoption in cybersecurity could take its ARR from NGS products to $15 billion in 2030. That would be nearly 5 times the ARR Palo Alto's NGS products are currently generating.\n\nThe company expects its total addressable market to increase between $13 billion and $17 billion thanks to AI. What's more, Palo Alto says that it achieved more than $100 million in AI-specific ARR in the second quarter. Management also points out that it has \"aggressive plans to roll out additional AI-based offerings by the end of this fiscal year.\"\n\nAs a result, it won't be surprising to see Palo Alto regain its mojo and start growing at a faster pace as it rolls out more AI-specific products. That's the reason why savvy investors may want to take advantage of the pullback in this cybersecurity stock and buy it considering that it could step on the gas in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Salesforce, Inc. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+33.1% vs. +11.9%). High interest rates, buyouts, opening new branches and decent loan demand will aid net interest income (NII), though rising funding costs will weigh on it.\r\n\r\nDespite some green shoots in the investment banking (IB) business, IB fees are less likely to improve anytime soon. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates, will likely hamper fee income growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Salesforce have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+79.5% vs. +59.8%). The company is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Salesforce's sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line.\r\n\r\nContinued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce's strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings will help the company tap the growing opportunities in the space.\r\n\r\nHowever, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Also, the challenging macroeconomic environment could hurt its growth prospects.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Salesforce here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+49.7% vs. -6.1%). The company's cystic franchise sales continue to grow, driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher.\r\n\r\nVertex saw rapid success in its non-CF pipeline candidates' development in 2023. Its one-shot gene therapy, Casgevy, was approved for two blood disorders in multiple regions, which diversified its commercial opportunity.\r\n\r\nVertex is on track to submit regulatory applications for VX-548 in acute pain and for vanzacaftor triple in CF by mid-2024. Vertex faces minimal competition in its core CF franchise.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and The Williams Companies, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nPalo Alto Networks' estimated fair value is US$395 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Palo Alto Networks' US$303 share price signals that it might be 23% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 18% higher than Palo Alto Networks' analyst price target of US$334\n\nDoes the February share price for Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$3.07b US$3.51b US$4.12b US$4.80b US$5.64b US$6.27b US$6.80b US$7.25b US$7.63b US$7.97b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x27 Analyst x26 Analyst x19 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 11.09% Est @ 8.45% Est @ 6.60% Est @ 5.31% Est @ 4.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9%  US$2.9k US$3.1k US$3.4k US$3.7k US$4.0k US$4.2k US$4.3k US$4.2k US$4.2k US$4.1k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$8.0b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.3%) = US$175b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$175b\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$90b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$128b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$303, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Palo Alto Networks as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Palo Alto Networks, there are three additional elements you should further examine:\n\nRisks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) stock is making gains in Monday's trading. The cybersecurity specialist's share price was up 9.3% as of 1:30 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBefore the market opened this morning, Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil released a note on Palo Alto Networks that maintained a positive rating on the stock. JPMorgan's Brian Essex also released a note stating that recent fears surrounding Palo Alto's outlook may be overblown. Investors are reacting positively to the coverage.\n\nSome analysts think Palo Alto's sell-offs are overdone\n\nPalo Alto Networks stock got crushed last week after the company issued disappointing forward guidance, but some on Wall Street believe that investors have become too bearish on the stock.\n\nWhile Susquehanna's Patil lowered the stocks' one-year price target from $400 per share to $325 per share, the analyst remained bullish on the stock. Even after this morning's surge, the price target suggests additional upside of roughly 5%.\n\nIn another note released this morning, JPMorgan analyst Brian Essex said he thinks there is some misunderstanding about Palo Alto's outlook commentary and deal structure. During the earnings call last week, Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora indicated that he was seeing some \"spending fatigue\" in the cybersecurity industry. But Essex seems to think that this comment hasn't been put in the proper context and that the investor reaction may have been overly negative.\n\nWhat comes next for Palo Alto?\n\nWith its last quarterly report, Palo Alto lowered its guidance for 2024. The company now expects total billings for this year to be between $10.1 billion and $10.2 billion, down from previous guidance for billings between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity specialist also lowered its sales target to between $7.95 billion and $8 billion -- down from an earlier target for revenue between $8.15 billion and $8.2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther complicating matters, Palo Alto is in the early stages of a major strategy shift. The company plans to offer more free services in hopes of building long-term platform contracts. While it's possible this strategy shift will pay off over the long haul, it likely means financial performance will face some headwinds in the near term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands out in the real estate sector with its compelling dividend yield of 2% and unique focus on data center properties, a critical asset in the current digital landscape. This specialization is particularly pertinent given the massive increase in digital data usage, reliance on cloud services, and the growing necessity for robust cybersecurity measures. The sector\u2019s vitality is further highlighted by significant investments from notable figures, such as Nancy Pelosi\u2019s move into Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), pointing to a sustained demand for secure data handling infrastructures. Positioned at the core of this digital shift, Equinix presents investors with a steady opportunity for growth, backed by the essential nature of its services in today\u2019s tech-driven world.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nEquinix\u2019s role as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) specializing in data centers places it at a crucial junction of real estate and technology, particularly cybersecurity. The increasing emphasis on data protection and cybersecurity, as highlighted by Pelosi\u2019s investment in PANW, not only underscores the sector\u2019s importance but also suggests a promising outlook for data centers. Equinix\u2019s vast network of data centers provides essential infrastructure for companies, including those in the cybersecurity field, making it an indirect beneficiary of the sector\u2019s growth.\n\nInvesting in Equinix allows for a unique blend of growth and income, a rare combination in the investment world. High-growth sectors like cybersecurity often lack a regular income component, while high-dividend stocks may not always promise significant growth. However, Equinix breaks this mold by offering a stake in the digital infrastructure critical to the tech and cybersecurity industries, ensuring its position in a rapidly expanding market. Moreover, as a REIT, Equinix distributes a significant portion of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends, enhancing its appeal to income-focused investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nEquinix\u2019s global footprint, with data centers in key strategic locations worldwide, is vital for mitigating geographical risks and ensuring a diverse tenant base. These facilities are integral to the operations of a wide range of businesses, including burgeoning tech companies and established cybersecurity firms, ensuring a stable demand for Equinix\u2019s properties.\n\nThe announcement of Equinix\u2019s dividend, coupled with its strategic position in the digital and cybersecurity realms, presents more than just an investment in real estate. It offers a pathway to participate indirectly in the growth of the cybersecurity sector, as highlighted by Pelosi\u2019s investment in PANW. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, driven by advancements in technology and an increased focus on data security, Equinix\u2019s role becomes ever more critical, potentially boosting its dividend prospects and making it an attractive option for investors seeking to diversify their portfolio with exposure to the burgeoning cybersecurity industry.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.  Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

They\u2019re a global leader in cybersecurity solutions and have been operating in the space for more than 2 decades. As previously forecasted, Fortinet\u2019s 2023 net-income eclipsed $1 billion for the first time.\n\nFortinet has largely been ignored by Wall Street as investors rushed to more popular cybersecurity stocks like Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). However, the company has continued to deliver strong YOY growth in revenue, FCF and EPS. Fortinet\u2019s cash flows have been robust in recent quarters, as gross billings and their flagship Fortigate firewall powered strong double digit growth.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this security software maker have returned -17.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Palo Alto belongs, has gained 11.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nPalo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +23.7%. This estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.14 indicates a change of +11.7% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palo Alto is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate of $1.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.2%. The $8 billion and $9.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.1% and +16%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.3%. EPS of $1.46 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.22%. The EPS surprise was +12.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "1 Amazing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Down 29% You'll Regret Not Buying on the Dip",
        "content": "Cyber threats are a growing concern among the world's top businesses. Technologies like generative artificial intelligence (AI) are helping bad actors craft sophisticated attacks by creating hyper-realistic phishing emails, and voice recordings that can trick employees into handing over sensitive information.\n\nIn fact, 64% of the 4,702 CEOs recently surveyed by PwC believe generative AI will increase cybersecurity risk in their organizations over the next 12 months. It was their biggest concern when it comes to AI, outranking the spread of misinformation and potential legal risks.\n\nAdvanced cybersecurity tools that use AI to deliver smarter, more automated protection are required to combat these new-age threats -- and Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is a leader in that very field, but the stock has had a rough go of it lately.\n\nThe company recently released results for its fiscal 2024's second quarter (ended Jan. 31). That sent the shares plunging 29% as the company announced a shift in its business strategy. However, these new steps could bear fruit over the long term. Here's why investors should consider the stock now.\n\nPalo Alto is a leader in AI-based cybersecurity\n\nPalo Alto's business is split into three platforms: network security, cloud security, and security operations. The company is gradually weaving AI through many of the products under those banners to give businesses the most advanced protection possible.\n\nHere's a notable statistic. Palo Alto says 93% of security operations centers within organizations still rely on human-led processes. Cybersecurity managers are under such a heavy workload that 23% of incidents are left uninvestigated, which creates an unacceptable number of vulnerabilities.\n\nPalo Alto's Cortex XSIAM security operations platform was designed to solve that problem. AI and automation are at its core, and for one large customer, it has reduced the number of incidents that require manual investigation by 75%. Another customer now has 90% of their security incidents solved by automation, up from 10% prior to adopting XSIAM. XSIAM was launched a little over one year ago, and it has already amassed a revenue pipeline worth $1 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the AI opportunity is just heating up. Organizations and their employees will be using AI an increasing amount in the coming years, and Palo Alto says security isn't yet front and center. They could be accessing AI in an insecure manner that places their critical data at risk, and plugging those vulnerabilities could be a $5 billion opportunity by 2030.\n\nPlus, Palo Alto says the frequency of phishing emails has increased 12-fold over the last year because of AI's ability to generate them instantly. According to CrowdStrike, 90% of successful cyberattacks originate at the endpoint -- the computer or device used by each employee -- making it the most vulnerable part of every company.\n\nPhishing emails tend to target those employees, and since Palo Alto already protects roughly 100 million individual users, it has a huge opportunity ahead in limiting the damage.\n\nA strong Q2, but reduced full-year forecast\n\nPalo Alto delivered $2 billion of revenue in the second quarter, marking a 19% increase from the year-ago period. It also delivered $1.46 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share, which was a 39% increase. Palo Alto was profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\u00a0basis, too, although the result benefited from a large one-off income tax benefit.\n\nThe point is, this company is delivering revenue growth without substantial losses at the bottom line, unlike many of its competitors, which are still burning through cash each quarter. Palo Alto's remaining performance obligations (RPOs) also soared 22% to $10.8 billion, which typically converts to revenue over time.\n\nHowever, Palo Alto's management team unexpectedly reduced its forecast for both RPOs and revenue for the fiscal 2024 full year. The company is undergoing a major strategy shift to position itself for accelerated growth in the future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe shift toward platformization\n\nThe cybersecurity industry is fragmented, with companies often piecing products together from different providers based on their needs. Historically, Palo Alto has relied on the quality of its products to attract its customers to use more of them.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Palo Alto's business is split into three platforms. Well, the lifetime value of customers using all three platforms is 40 times greater than those using just one. Therefore, incentivizing large customers to use Palo Alto for all of their needs could drive enormous growth in the long term.\n\nThe problem is that large organizations often have existing contracts with their cybersecurity providers and can't simply opt out whenever they please. So, Palo Alto is offering them fee-free periods to capture them while they are still contracted with a competitor. Then, once that contact runs out, they will convert into paying customers for Palo Alto.\n\nIt's a great strategy that forgoes short-term revenue (hence the drop in billings and revenue guidance) in exchange for potentially significant growth in the long term. Plus, it squeezes out Palo Alto's competitors in the process.\n\nWhy Palo Alto stock is a buy now\n\nPalo Alto believes the accelerated shift to platformization will help the company reach $15 billion in annual revenue by 2030, 90% of which will be recurring revenue, creating a stable and reliable business.\n\nConsidering that the company expects to deliver $8 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024, hitting that goal would translate to an 87.5% increase between now and then -- or a compound annual growth rate of 11%.\n\nHowever, Palo Alto thinks there could be upside to its $15 billion target thanks to AI. That isn't surprising given that so many companies developing AI technologies are delivering explosive growth right now. The truth is, nobody knows exactly how much the threat landscape might be altered by sophisticated AI-based attacks, so the true size of Palo Alto's long-term opportunity is hard to discern.\n\nSo, while investors rushed for the exits following the reduction in Palo Alto's guidance, the 29% drop in its stock price presents an opportunity for investors who are willing to hold for the long term. They might be glad they bought in when they look back on this moment in a few years, assuming Palo Alto's vision becomes reality.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Stock: Bear vs. Bull",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ: PANW) stock price plummeted 28% on Feb. 21 in response to the company's latest earnings report. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Jan. 31, the cybersecurity company's revenue rose 19% year over year to $1.98 billion and exceeded analysts' estimates by $10 million. Its adjusted earnings grew 39% to $1.46 per share and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.16.\n\nPalo Alto's headline numbers seemed healthy, but it followed up its earnings beat with a reduction to its full-year guidance and a jarring shift in its long-term strategy. Let's review the bear and bull cases to see if its fallen shares are worth buying. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe key numbers\n\nPalo Alto's billings and revenue growth decelerated significantly in the first half of fiscal 2024. That slowdown can be attributed to the macro headwinds, which made it harder for cybersecurity to lock customers into longer-term contracts, and stiff competition. But as its top-line growth cooled off, it reined in its spending to strengthen its operating margins.\n\nMetric Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Billings Growth (YOY) 26% 26% 18% 16% 16% Revenue Growth (YOY) 26% 24% 26% 20% 19% Adjusted Operating Margin 22.8% 23.6% 28.4% 28.2% 28.6% Adjusted EPS Growth (YOY) 81% 83% 80% 66% 39%\n\nData source: Palo Alto Networks. YOY = Year-over-year.\n\nThe bear case when it comes to Palo Alto\n\nThat slowdown wasn't surprising, but Palo Alto's revised guidance cut stunned the bulls. For the full year, it expects its billings to only rise 10%-11%. That's a drastic reduction from its previous full-year outlook for 16%-17% billings growth -- which had already been cut from its sunnier outlook for 18%-20% growth at the end of fiscal 2023.\n\nAs a result, Palo Alto expects its revenue to only rise 15%-16% for the full year, which is well below its prior outlook for 18%-19% growth and analysts' expectations for 19% growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto attributed that slowdown to tougher competition and a strategic \"shift\" toward consolidating its customers onto a single unified platform to eliminate their dependence on smaller cybersecurity companies for specific services. It expects that strategy to widen its moat and increase the stickiness of its ecosystem, but it will initially be driven by trials and deferred revenue deals, which won't boost its near-term billings growth.\n\nDuring the conference call, CEO Nikesh Arora said those customers wouldn't pay any fees for a \"period of time\" after locking themselves into its platform, and that shift would curb its billings and revenue growth over the \"next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nInvestors might have been forgiving of that loss-leading strategy if Palo Alto's stock were trading at lower valuations. But even after its post-earnings decline, it still doesn't look cheap at 49 times forward earnings and 11 times this year's sales. Its insiders have also sold nearly 10 times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months.\n\nThe bull case for Palo Alto\n\nOn the bright side, Palo Alto expects this \"platformization\" strategy to pay off over the long term and spur its higher-growth next-gen security (NGS) services -- which include its Prisma cloud security tools and Cortex AI threat detection tools -- to generate $15 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by fiscal 2030. That would be more than four times higher than its $3.49 billion in NGS ARR at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024. It also expects more than 90% of its revenue to be recurring by fiscal 2030 as its adjusted operating margin rises to the \"low to mid 30s.\"\n\nMoreover, its near-term operating margins, free cash flow (FCF), and earnings per share (EPS) are all rising. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, it expects its adjusted operating margin to expand from 24% to 26.5%-27%, its adjusted FCF margin to stay nearly flat at 38%-39%, and its adjusted EPS to rise 23%-25% -- which matches analysts' expectations for 24% growth. It's stayed profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for seven consecutive quarters.\n\nThose healthy bottom-line numbers suggest Palo Alto still has plenty of pricing power and that it can afford to throttle its own billings growth to lock more customers into its ecosystem. During the call, Arora said the company's lower near-term billings guidance was \"not a consequence of a change in the demand outlook\" but rather a deliberate shift in its long-term strategy.\n\nIs Palo Alto worth buying right now?\n\nI've owned shares of Palo Alto Networks since early 2021, and its rally over the past three years turned it into one of my largest positions. I admittedly sold 17% of my shares after the latest earnings report to free up cash for other stocks, but I'm still keeping my remaining shares and waiting to see how its \"platformization\" strategy plays out.\n\nPalo Alto is still a good long-term play on the cybersecurity market, but it could remain out of favor this year until its top-line growth stabilizes again. So for now, the bears could remain in charge -- but the bulls should eventually return.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Palo Alto Networks a Buy on Its Post-Earnings Plunge?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) has been one of the best leaders in the cybersecurity sector, with the stock having been up about 116% in the past year alone.\n\nThat is until Wednesday, Feb. 21, when the stock plunged over 28% in a single day following its second quarter earnings.\n\nInvestors were spooked when Palo Alto lowered its prior guidance for the year. In its defense, management said the lower guide was due to a deliberate aggressive pricing strategy aimed at winning market share.\n\nBut should investors really buy the dip, and take on the risk of this new strategy working out?\n\nTaking down expectations\n\nIn the earnings release, Palo Alto management took its full-year revenue guidance down to $7.95 billion to $8 billion from prior guidance of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion. Moreover, management also took down full-year billings guidance to $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion, from a prior range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion .\n\nNeedless to say, with a stock trading around 60 times earnings heading into the print, the guide-down was bound to get a nasty reaction. Hence why Palo Alto plunged 28.4% on Wednesday following the earnings release.\n\nManagement explains\n\nThe revenue and billings shortfall was explained by management as a deliberate strategy, in which Palo Alto plans to essentially give away a lot of products for free, temporarily, in order to allow customers to consolidate around Palo Alto as a complete \"platform.\"\n\nThe thinking, according to CEO Nikesh Arora, is that a lot of Palo Alto's customers have different vendors for different products, whether it's for intrusion protection (IPS), SD-WAN network protection, firewalls, zero trust, or endpoint protection. While Palo Alto has been taking share and delivering strong results prior to this quarter, Arora explained that sometimes it's difficult to transition a customer to adopt more of its services and displace an incumbent vendor on a certain product, due to customer fears over execution risk.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Palo Alto is now doing is saying to customers it will provide this service for free while the customer is still under contract with another vendor, until the existing contract runs out. The thinking is that because Palo Alto has one of the stronger portfolios of cyber products in the space, and since corporations are looking to mitigate their corporate costs, Palo Alto may use this strategy to help customers adopt its \"bundle\" and therefore simplify their vendors while saving money.\n\nIt's actually a pretty smart-sounding strategy, but there are several risks for investors to consider, too. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhy now?\n\nTo be sure, the move is spurring concerns over a lack of demand and perhaps price wars in the cybersecurity sector, which might not be good for Palo Alto, at least in the near-to-medium term.\n\nMoreover, when management was explaining the reasons behind the strategy shift, it was a bit obtuse. On the one hand, it maintained that demand for cybersecurity was \"strong,\" yet also said customers had shown \"spending fatigue.\" When challenged on the seeming contradiction, Arora went on:\n\n... they're feeling like my budget for cybersecurity keeps going up in double-digits every year because I'm trying to protect against every new threat vector. Yet, you see the number of breaches continues to rise. So our customer are sitting down and saying, if I spend more money, can you show me how I get a lower total cost of ownership across my enterprise? How do I spend less on the services that I have to deploy? And how do I get better ROI? So I think it's more about optimizing their current cybersecurity budgets as opposed to there being no demand. Demand continues to be very strong.\n\nClearly, customers are getting angry about how much they are having to spend on cybersecurity. And while that means the need is high, it also means there could be a short-term price war and pressure on cyber stock margins.\n\nAnother concern is that another quasi-peer in Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) just reported excellent numbers, which seems to go against Palo Alto's narrative. While Cloudflare isn't a direct competitor in many cases to Palo Alto, as its core products deal with network performance, it does have a lot of security offerings such as Zero Trust, DDoS protection, application firewalls and network security.\n\nSo, it's a little bit tough to square why Palo Alto feels it has to take this bold step while a company like Cloudflare is doing so well.\n\nBut the move could pay off... eventually\n\nWhile price wars are unpleasant to wage, the eventual winners could come out stronger on the other side. But that only happens if less-strong players eventually go away or merge to consolidate to fewer competitors. That process could take time, and come with more pain across the entire sector.\n\nIf Palo Alto's announcement is any indication, it could be rough going for both Palo Alto as well as its competitors in the space for a while. Given that the company makes minimal GAAP profits and still trades above 10 times this year's sales guidance even after the drop, the stock could tread water for quite a while until the new strategy's success or failure is verified by investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Will CrowdStrike Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2040?",
        "content": "CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD) has generated big gains since its public debut in June 2019. The cybersecurity company went public at $34 with a valuation of $6.7 billion, and it now trades at about $300 with a market cap of $70 billion.\n\nThe bulls loved CrowdStrike because it was disrupting older cybersecurity companies with its cloud-native services, which locked its customers into sticky subscriptions and eliminated the need for on-site appliances. From fiscal 2020 (which ended in Jan. 2020) to fiscal 2023, its annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67% as its total number of subscription customers more than quadrupled from 5,431 to 23,019.\n\nThose breakneck growth rates are impressive, but could CrowdStrike continue expanding and become a trillion-dollar company by 2040? Let's review its business model to see if it has a shot at joining the four-comma club. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCrowdStrike's hypergrowth days could be over\n\nAnalysts expect CrowdStrike's revenue to rise 36% in fiscal 2024, 29% in fiscal 2025, and 26% in fiscal 2026. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they suggest its business is maturing as it faces more competitors.\n\nFor example, Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is expanding into the cloud security market with Prisma, Microsoft is rolling out more first-party cybersecurity services for its cloud-based ecosystem, Cisco is integrating more cybersecurity services into its own networking equipment, and its smaller challenger SentinelOne is trying to automate the entire threat detection process with AI algorithms across a hybrid mix of on-site appliances and cloud-based services.\n\nThe cloud-native network security market could expand at a CAGR of 14% from 2024 to 2029, according to Global Market Estimates. Mordor Intelligence expects the cloud endpoint security market -- where CrowdStrike's Falcon mainly operates -- to grow at a CAGR of only 12% during the same period.\n\nCrowdStrike might continue to grow faster than the broader industry as it expands its ecosystem and gobbles up its smaller competitors, but it probably can't replicate its hypergrowth rates from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023. That gradual slowdown could be worrisome for a stock that already trades at 23 times next year's sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow fast will CrowdStrike grow over the next 16 years?\n\nIf CrowdStrike grows its top line at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2040, its annual revenue will rise from $2.2 billion to $50 billion. If it's still trading at 20 times sales by then, its market cap could hit $1 trillion. That said, it would need to play its cards nearly perfectly to maintain that high growth rate and premium valuation.\n\nWith a more conservative CAGR of 15% -- which seems more realistic as it faces tougher competitive challenges and unpredictable macro headwinds -- its revenue would reach $24 billion by 2040. If it's trading at a more reasonable 10 times sales, which would be comparable to Palo Alto Networks' current price-to-sales ratio, it could be worth about $240 billion.\n\nFocus on these core growth metrics instead\n\nSimply put, CrowdStrike has a narrow but viable path toward hitting a trillion-dollar valuation by 2040 -- but it could easily fall short of that lofty target as its growth cools off.\n\nSo instead of wondering if CrowdStrike will ever become a trillion-dollar company, investors should focus on its growth in customers and their increased adoption of its cloud modules instead. In its latest quarter, 42% of its customers were using at least six of its modules, compared to 36% of its customers a year ago. It's also remained profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for three consecutive quarters as it reined in its spending and stock-based compensation.\n\nThose fundamental improvements indicate its ecosystem is sticky and that it still has plenty of pricing power in the crowded cybersecurity market. So as a long-term investor in CrowdStrike, I believe it could still easily generate more multibagger gains over the next two decades -- and I'm not concerned about its ability to join the 12-zero club in the distant future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Buy Palo Alto Networks Stock on This Dip -- Just Not Yet",
        "content": "Veteran investors know the time to step into good stocks is after an erroneous sell-off. That's why so many people are now eying Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) shares following Wednesday's post-earnings dip. The 28% tumble is a huge discount on a solid company's stock.\n\nThis is one of those cases, however, where interested investors might want to keep their powder dry for at least a few more days. This plunge is different than the typical setback for most stocks. It could linger, and perhaps even worsen before reversing course.\n\nInvestors are seeing the glass as half-empty\n\nCybersecurity outfit Palo Alto Networks reported its fiscal second-quarter 2024 numbers after Tuesday's close. The top line grew to the tune of 19% to $2 billion in the period ended Dec. 31, 2023, and per-share profits of $1.46 were a marked improvement on the year-ago comparison of $1.05. Contracted revenue (for future booking) was up 22% year over year to $10.8 billion. Last quarter's numbers were also better than analysts' expectations.\n\nThe stumbling block? Guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2024. The company dialed it back for a second quarter in a row. Total full-year revenue is now expected to roll in between $7.95 billion and $8 billion. Half a year ago the revenue guidance was a range of $8.15 billion and $8.2 billion. Total billings should be lower than last August's original forecasts as well. The market just panicked, fearing these revisions point to tougher headwinds on the horizon.\n\nThe sell-off is an overreaction though. As Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora explained during Tuesday's earnings call, this lowered guidance reflects the company's intentional \"platformization\" efforts. That is, adding several different products to a particular customer's cloud-based software package for up to half a year at no additional charge. The hope is that these clients will like their new tools so much that they end up paying for access to them for at least several more years.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors, however, fear the tactic marks the beginning of a brutal price war that may never end.\n\nLost in all the noise is the fact that this sales tactic is actually quite cost-effective, since access to the cloud-based cybersecurity tools in question can be turned on and off by Palo Alto Networks with just a few keystrokes. In this same vein, also lost in Wednesday's dust-up is that Palo Alto still raised its full-year profit outlook despite lower revenue guidance.\n\nThen there's the not-so-minor reality that this company is well equipped to fight any price war it may have just started.\n\nIt certainly sounds like a juicy buying opportunity. Just don't be in too big of a hurry to take the plunge.\n\nMore than a knee-jerk reaction to lowered guidance\n\nIf you've already scooped up Palo Alto shares or if you can't wait any longer, you're not doomed.\n\nWednesday's steep pullback isn't your typical post-earnings stumble though, for handful of reasons. Chief among these reasons is the marketwide backdrop itself. It's not great.\n\nSee, stocks have been rallying since October on hopes that the global economy was headed for a soft landing, ushered in by waning inflation and a subsequent series of gradual rate cuts. Now it's not clear that's what's in the cards. Inflation isn't exactly cooling off as quickly as hoped, nor is the Federal Reserve as keen on lowering interest rates as quickly as expected.\n\nShellshocked investors are suddenly rethinking all of their purchases. Following their 50% three-month run-up, Palo Alto Networks shares may have been especially vulnerable to even the slightest of missteps from the broad market.\n\nThe lowered guidance may also be serving as a wakeup call to shareholders regarding Palo Alto's valuation -- even though its underlying earnings aren't expected impacted by the aforementioned top-line lull.\n\nIt's curious. Sometimes the market's willing to overlook an outrageous valuation as long as the growth story remains perfectly intact. That's been Palo Alto for years now. Investors didn't mind its regular losses all the way through 2021, knowing it was making progress toward profits. That finally happened in 2022, and those profits have widened in the meantime. PANW Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe kind of money Palo Alto Networks is now making, though, is in the same ballpark as the kind of money it's going to be able to earn a few years from now. With shares priced at more than 40 times this year's projected profits and more than 30 times 2026's expected per-share earnings of $7.93, all of a sudden the premium valuation doesn't feel so comfortable. It happens.\n\nFinally, Palo Alto's announcement didn't just catch investors off guard. It surprised analysts, too. Not too many of them outright downgraded the stock, but several analysts weighed in with lowered price targets. Don't be surprised to see a few more follow suit in the near future, as they digest the company's sales strategy and what it may mean for the entire cybersecurity business. This could keep the narrative leaning in a bearish direction for at least a few more days.\n\nAll of these stumbling blocks, however, are temporary.\n\nBut Palo Alto stock is still a buy -- sooner or later\n\nInvestors are still generally better served by not trying to perfectly time the market. Nobody does it very well for very long. It often ends up hurting more than helping, in fact.\n\nThat's not what this is though. Taking a pause before plunging into any new Palo Alto position isn't an attempt to time the market as much as it is a means of managing risk by allowing the post-earnings effect to run its full course.\n\nDoing so might work in your favor, or it may work against you. Palo Alto Networks stock is in a scenario it's never really been in before. That's why you must resist the temptation to be one of the first ones to try and catch this falling knife, so to speak.\n\nBut how long should you wait to make any purchase? Give it at least a week, but there's no need to wait longer than a month if you're certain you want to own it for the long haul.\n\nBy the way, Precedence Research says the global cybersecurity market is poised to grow at an annualized pace of 12.6% through 2032.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Stock Dropped 25% This Week. Here's Why.",
        "content": "Shares of Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) dropped over 25% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The cybersecurity giant dropped its revenue and billings guidance for fiscal year 2024, causing analysts to lower their price targets. Shares of Palo Alto Networks have soared in the past year with more and more cybersecurity threats emerging and government mandates in places like the U.S. Despite this recent drop, Palo Alto Networks stock is up 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nSlowing growth, lowered guidance\n\nIn its second quarter, Palo Alto Networks' revenue grew 19% year over year to $2 billion. The company is not very profitable, posting just $54 million in operating income last quarter, but it has a huge opportunity ahead of it with the continued need for cybersecurity from companies and government agencies.\n\nThe problem is, this opportunity has created massive expectations in Palo Alto Networks stock. Expectations were not met this quarter as the company lowered its revenue and billings guidance for fiscal year 2024. It now expects total billings in the range of $10.1 billion-$10.2 billion, down from $10.7 billion-$10.8 billion, and revenue from $7.95 billion-$8 billion, down from $8.15 billion-$8.2 billion.\n\nThese are significant guidance cuts in a year when cybersecurity is supposed to see huge demand, which is why many analysts downgraded the stock in the days following the earnings report. It is no surprise then to see Palo Alto Networks stock down 25% in just the last few trading days.\n\nIs the stock cheap?\n\nAfter its drop, Palo Alto Networks now trades at a market cap of $90 billion. The company generates close to $3 billion in free cash flow, but due to a lot of stock-based compensation and deferred revenue, its operating income was only $600 million over the past 12 months. Cash flow of $3 billion brings the stock multiple to around 30 times, which is still well above the market average.\n\nEven at this discounted price, Palo Alto Networks stock remains expensive. That means investors need to have confidence in continued growth from the company for the stock to do well. That might be the case with the growing spending on cybersecurity from all sorts of entities around the world, making the stock a potential \"buy the dip\" candidate after this latest earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) jumped 5.8% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia's outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.\n\nIs now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nCrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was one day ago, when the company dropped 11.8% after cybersecurity stocks fell as industry stalwart, Palo Alto Networks reported fourth-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. This is never a good sign. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well. Palo Alto Networks highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) Customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term demand forecast provided was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of \"a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings.\" In addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a \"platformization\" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, Palo Alto Networks noted that a typical customer adopting the platform \" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months.\" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.\n\nOverall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance highlighting several issues within the business as well as potential challenges for cybersecurity players in the coming quarter.\n\nCrowdStrike is up 25.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $308.88 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $334.55 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,325.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

        "content": "Insiders seem to have made the most of their holdings by selling US$21m worth of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stock at an average sell price of US$226 during the past year. After the stock price dropped 29% last week, the company's market value declined by US$31b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.\n\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nPalo Alto Networks Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman & CEO, Nikesh Arora, for US$17m worth of shares, at about US$226 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$262, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 13% of Nikesh Arora's stake.\n\nIn the last year Palo Alto Networks insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! insider-trading-volume\n\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this freelist of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\n\nInsiders At Palo Alto Networks Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Palo Alto Networks shares. In total, Independent Director John Key sold US$709k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Palo Alto Networks insiders own 1.1% of the company, worth about US$915m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\n\nSo What Do The Palo Alto Networks Insider Transactions Indicate?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Palo Alto Networks makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Palo Alto Networks (1 is concerning!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Robust revenue growth with a 19.3% year-over-year increase, signaling strong market demand. Significant net income surge to $1.7 billion, reflecting effective business strategies and tax benefits. Continued investment in innovation and product development to maintain competitive edge. Global presence with a diverse customer base, including the majority of the Global 2000 companies.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PANW.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW), a leading cybersecurity solutions provider, filed its 10-Q report, revealing a comprehensive financial performance and strategic positioning. The California-based company, known for its platform-based approach to network, cloud, and security operations, has reported a significant year-over-year revenue increase of 19.3%, with total revenue reaching nearly $2 billion for the quarter ended January 31, 2024. This growth is attributed to the adoption of its extensive product portfolio, which includes both product sales and subscription services. Notably, net income experienced a dramatic rise to $1.7 billion, largely due to a tax benefit, showcasing the company's financial resilience and strategic acumen. With over 85,000 customers worldwide, PANW continues to solidify its market position, backed by a strong commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Decoding Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nFinancial Performance and Customer Base: Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) has demonstrated robust financial health, with a 19.3% increase in revenue year-over-year and a substantial net income of $1.7 billion. This financial prowess is underpinned by a diverse and growing customer base, including the majority of the Global 2000 companies. The company's ability to secure recurring revenue streams through its subscription and support services, which account for 80.2% of total revenue, is a testament to its strong market position and the high demand for its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nInnovation and Product Development: PANW's commitment to innovation is evident in its continued investment in research and development, totaling $447.9 million for the quarter. The launch of PAN-OS 11.1 Cosmos and Cortex XSIAM 2.0 reflects the company's focus on staying ahead of cyber threats with advanced AI-driven solutions. This strategic emphasis on innovation not only enhances the company's product offerings but also positions it as a leader in the cybersecurity industry, capable of addressing evolving security challenges.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Channel Partners: While PANW's indirect fulfillment model has been successful, it also presents a potential weakness. The company's reliance on distributors and resellers to sell its products and services could lead to challenges if these partners fail to perform. Any disruptions in this sales channel could impact PANW's ability to distribute its products effectively, potentially harming its operating results and market reach.\n\nCompetitive Market Pressures: The cybersecurity industry is fiercely competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. PANW faces competition from large companies with more extensive resources, as well as specialized vendors that may introduce disruptive technologies. To maintain its competitive edge, PANW must continue to innovate and adapt to market changes, which could strain financial and human resources.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpanding Cybersecurity Demand: The increasing prevalence of cyber threats and the growing complexity of IT environments present significant opportunities for PANW. As organizations prioritize cybersecurity, the demand for comprehensive solutions like those offered by PANW is expected to rise. The company's extensive portfolio and expertise position it well to capitalize on this trend and expand its market share.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions: PANW's strategy includes acquiring complementary companies and technologies to enhance its product offerings and market presence. With a strong balance sheet and a history of successful integrations, PANW is well-positioned to pursue strategic acquisitions that could open up new revenue streams and fortify its industry standing.\n\nThreats\n\nEconomic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: Global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions can significantly impact customer spending and behavior. Factors such as inflation, interest rate fluctuations, and regional conflicts could adversely affect PANW's financial performance. The company must navigate these uncertainties while maintaining its commitment to customer satisfaction and innovation.\n\nTechnological Disruption: The rapid pace of technological change in the cybersecurity industry poses a threat to PANW. The emergence of new and disruptive technologies could challenge the company's product relevance and require continuous investment in research and development. PANW must remain agile and responsive to these changes to sustain its market leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a strategic focus on innovation and customer expansion. Its robust revenue growth, significant net income, and sustained investment in product development underscore its strengths. However, the company must address its reliance on channel partners and competitive market pressures to maintain its competitive edge. Opportunities for growth lie in the expanding cybersecurity demand and potential strategic acquisitions, while economic and geopolitical uncertainties, along with technological disruptions, represent key threats. Overall, PANW's strategic initiatives and market positioning suggest a favorable outlook, provided it continues to adapt to the dynamic cybersecurity landscape.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "Palo Alto Networks Stock (NASDAQ:PANW): Threats Detected; Stay in Safe Mode",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) specializes in threat detection, but now there are threats detected in the company\u2019s commentary about the cybersecurity market. Therefore, even though Palo Alto Networks just managed to pull off a bottom-line Street beat, I am neutral on PANW stock.\n\nHeadquartered in California, Palo Alto Networks provides cybersecurity software. Like many other technology-focused businesses, Palo Alto Networks emphasized its products\u2019 artificial intelligence (AI) features. This helped to send the Palo Alto Networks share price significantly higher during the past year.\n\nPANW stock is crashing today, though, and it\u2019s understandable if people want to know exactly what\u2019s going on. The news isn\u2019t all bad, but Palo Alto Networks\u2019 management delivered a cautionary remark that should make prospective investors think twice.\n\nA \u201cStrong and Unique Position\u201d for Palo Alto Networks\n\n\u201cOur leadership across all of our three platforms and growing cross-platform adoption puts us in a strong and unique position,\u201d Palo Alto Networks CEO\u00a0Nikesh Arora recently declared. This quote is taken from Palo Alto Networks\u2019 quarterly press release, in which Arora made sure to emphasize the company\u2019s \u201cAI leadership strategy.\u201d\n\nSo, is Palo Alto Networks really in a \u201cstrong and unique position\u201d? We can cherry-pick some data points to support this contention. For example, in the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2024, Palo Alto Networks\u00a0grew its revenue by 19%\u00a0year-over-year to\u00a0$1.975 billion. That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at, and this result beat the consensus estimate by $10 million.\n\nFurthermore, Palo Alto Networks posted a bottom-line beat with Q2-FY2024 non-GAAP net income of\u00a0$0.5 billion, or\u00a0$1.46\u00a0per diluted share. This shows improvement over the net income of\u00a0$0.3 billion, or\u00a0$1.05\u00a0per diluted share, that Palo Alto Networks reported in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nPlus, this result surpassed Wall Street\u2019s consensus earnings estimate of $1.30 per share. It\u2019s another win for Palo Alto Networks, which has an excellent track record of beating analysts\u2019 quarterly EPS estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn light of these results, maybe Palo Alto Networks is indeed in a \u201cstrong and unique position.\u201d On the other hand, the market is forward-looking and wants to know whether Palo Alto Networks\u2019 management is confident about the future. So, let\u2019s move on to the company\u2019s forward guidance, along with a remark that might startle you.\n\nPalo Alto Networks Faces \u201cSpending Fatigue\u201d\n\nNot all of Arora\u2019s comments were as confident as the aforementioned \u201cstrong and unique position\u201d remark. In actuality, Arora might not be as confident as some investors would want him to be.\n\nIn a conference call, Arora observed, \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to notice customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity.\u201d The CEO also noticed Palo Alto Networks\u2019 customers asking themselves, \u201cHow do I spend less on the services that I have to deploy?\u201d\n\nAlong with Arora\u2019s troubling remarks, Palo Alto Networks issued forward guidance that some investors won\u2019t want to hear. For the current quarter, Palo Alto Networks anticipates revenue of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion, which comes up short when compared to the $2.04 billion that Wall Street had forecast.\n\nAdditionally, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 management guided for current-quarter adjusted EPS in the ranges of $1.24 to $1.26. Again, there\u2019s a shortfall here, as analysts wanted to see adjusted EPS of $1.30.\n\nMoreover, the full year could be hampered by \u201cspending fatigue.\u201d For Fiscal Year 2024, guided for Palo Alto Networks of $7.95 billion to $8 billion. On the other hand, the consensus estimate called for full-year revenue of $8.19 billion.\n\nSo, what do analysts think about Palo Alto Networks? We\u2019ll get to the consensus opinion in a moment, but at least one analyst appears to be concerned about Palo Alto Networks.\n\nIn particular, Piper Sandler downgraded PANW stock from Overweight to Neutral and cut its price target on the shares from $350 to $300. Piper Sandler pointed out that, for the third consecutive quarter, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 results \u201care creating a large degree of investor consternation.\u201d There\u2019s no denying that this is true, as Palo Alto Networks stock is down 28% today.\n\nIs PANW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, PANW comes in as a Strong Buy based on\u00a026 Buys and three Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average Palo Alto Networks stock price target is $391.82, implying 49% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell PANW stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Patrick Colville of Scotiabank, with an average return of 40.51% per rating and a 94% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider PANW Stock?\n\nIs there an irresistible bargain now that investors are dumping their Palo Alto Networks shares? Not necessarily, as Palo Alto Networks\u2019 decent quarterly results are being overshadowed by the company\u2019s cautious forward guidance and the CEO\u2019s \u201cspending fatigue\u201d remark.\n\nSince Palo Alto Networks\u2019 management doesn\u2019t seem entirely confident, then investors shouldn\u2019t be too bullish right now. Therefore, I feel that this isn\u2019t the ideal time to consider a share position in PANW stock.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Shares of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW) have plummeted by its biggest single-day loss after slashing its full-year guidance. Piper Sandler Co-Head of Technology Research Rob Owens joins Yahoo Finance Live to explain why he downgraded Palo Alto's stock to Neutral and moved to \"look at other names for cyber exposure\".\n\nOwens points out this is now \"the third quarter in a row\" Palo Alto has lowered its billings outlook. He finds this concerning given that the overall cybersecurity sector is performing \"well\" currently. Owens notes positive industry tailwinds like \"increased disclosure requirements from the SEC\" and more regulation around AI. However, he states \"Palo Alto is struggling a bit\" despite these circumstances.\n\nOwens says Palo Alto stands out as \"one of the few security consolidators that sits across a lot of domains.\" He highlights their success in firewalls, cloud security, endpoint protections, and more. But as Palo Alto expanded, so did the competition and internal headwinds now challenging the company.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Shares of Palo Alto networks seeing their biggest decline ever as Wall Street turned sour on the stock. Analysts now rethinking their views and ratings on the cybersecurity company after it lowered its full year guidance. Here with more on the short and long-term trajectory for Palo Alto, let's get to Rob Owens, Piper Sandler's co-head of technology research. Rob, it is great to see you and to have you on the show. And let's just get right to it, Rob.\n\nSo Palo Alto Networks, you cut your rating, Rob, right? You go to a neutral, so you've moved to the sidelines. How come, Rob? Just walk us through the change.\n\nROB OWENS: Yeah. We think after the events of last night, it was appropriate to move to the sidelines, Josh. It was the third quarter in a row where we have had a lowered billings outlook from the company effectively. The first one being relative to street consensus at the end of their fiscal year. And the last two were guides down.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd the company is changing its strategy relative to go-to market. You're seeing more giving away of product and competitive situations in hoping to bring in larger deals for the long term. So what are the implications here? We took about 600 million out of our billings number. That's about 6% for the year but realize that year ends in two quarters, it's a July fiscal year, and a couple hundred million in terms of revenue.\n\nSo we've seen consistent guidance down out of Palo Alto at a time where honestly we think cybersecurity is doing pretty well, you know, Josh, if you look at the competitive landscape, if you look at what's happened from a breach perspective. Number one, we had major breaches last year with Clorox and MGM, major ransomware events. You look at increased disclosure requirements and breach disclosure requirements from the SEC itself. You look at AI and the advent of a lot of new technologies. I think cyber is probably seeing some of the best fundamentals that's ever seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Palo Alto struggled a little bit, so we think it's appropriate to move to the sidelines and look towards other names for cyber exposure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So this is really interesting, Rob, because-- it's Julie here-- the discussion that we were having offline before the show was this very question. You know, given that there are still quite a number of threats, right, cyber threats, the question was, are companies pulling back their spending for some reason? Or is it a Palo Alto issue? And so it sounds like you think it is a Palo Alto issue. Is it that their offerings are not compelling enough, they're too expensive, as you say, they're now going to be doing promotions, or something else? What is it?\n\nROB OWENS: Well, I-- i think it's somewhat asymmetric to look at the threat landscape on one side and the spending environment on the other, because it doesn't make sense relative to what Palo said. And I think that they've gone after successfully over the last couple of years, by the way, very large customers. And some of those customers might be feeling a little bit of indigestion relative to security.\n\nBut if you look, I think, across the broader landscape, relative to, again, the threat environment, which is as robust as I've seen it in, honestly, my 27 years of covering security, increased regulatory requirements-- you had the director of the FBI out a couple of weeks ago talking about some type of cyber-like Pearl Harbor event to come in the next nine months on critical infrastructure. If companies are pulling back on their spending right now, I actually don't think that's a good thing. And I don't think that's the honest to God truth.\n\nSo at the end of the day, I think this is somewhat asymmetric specific to Palo Alto and some of the customers that they're dealing with and a little bit of shift in strategy. Now, Palo Alto is one of those few security consolidators that sits across a lot of domains. And what I mean by that is that came up in the firewall market, they've moved into cloud, they moved into endpoint SIEM, which is Security Information and Event Management. As you know, we love our acronyms in security.\n\nAnd so as Palo has gotten a lot broader, I think they've faced some headwinds definitely and some competitive headwinds. And so we're seeing the other side of that right now at a time where cyber is strong. They're getting more promotional. They're taking the numbers down and effectively telling investors, give us 12 to 18 months and things will kind of be back to normal.",

        "title": "Why Fortinet, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, and Other Cybersecurity Stocks Plunged Wednesday Morning",
        "content": "A number of cybersecurity companies slumped out of the gate Wednesday morning and never looked back. As of 1:35 p.m. ET, shares of Zscaler(NASDAQ: ZS) had plunged by 13.9%, SentinelOne(NYSE: S) was down 10.8%, CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD) had tumbled by 9.4%, Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) was off by 4.2%, and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) had lost 4.2%.\n\nA check of all the usual sources -- regulatory filings, analyst commentary, and financial reports -- found no company-specific news fueling these declines, suggesting the stock price moves were driven by the dismal outlook and strategy shift by a rival in the space. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSolid results with a dose of uncertainty\n\nAfter the close Tuesday, Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW)reported results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter, and investors were taken aback. For the period, which ended Jan. 31, revenue grew 19% year over year to $2 billion, driven higher by expanding relationships with existing customers. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.46, up 39%.\n\nThose results exceeded analysts' consensus estimates, which had called for revenue of $1.97 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.30.\n\nHowever, it was a dramatic shift in the company's strategy that surprised investors, and which led management to slash Palo Alto's full-year guidance.\n\nPalo Alto Networks offers three platforms, which include network security, cloud security, and security operations. CEO Nikesh Arora announced Palo Alto was seeking to accelerate its multiplatform strategy. He noted that the customer lifetime value of a client that adopted two of its three platforms was five times the value of a single-platform customer. For those that adopt three platforms, the number is more than 40 times larger -- so it's understandable that the company would seek to accelerate multiplatform adoption.\n\nTo support this shift in strategy, management noted that beginning Thursday, it will be \"launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers\" in the form of incentives, free trials, and discounts. Over the next 12 to 18 months as this program ramps up, Arora expects Palo Alto to take a hit to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of that, management has reduced its guidance. For the company's fiscal third quarter, management is guiding for revenue in a range of $1.95 billion and $1.98 billion, which would amount to year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. Perhaps most telling is its outlook for billings to grow by just 3% to $2.33 billion, which illustrates the consequences of the company's decision -- at least over the short term.\n\nArora also noted the company was beginning to see \"spending fatigue in cybersecurity.\" Investors took that as a bad sign for the whole industry, and many stocks in the space sold off in unison.\n\nMaking a mountain out of a company-specific molehill\n\nSo what does all this mean for Palo Alto's rivals?\n\nIn a word -- nothing.\n\nGuggenheim analyst John DiFucci questioned the company's need to offer incentives \"when other companies embark on similar paths of consolidation without having to give away product for a time.\"\n\nJefferies analyst Joseph Gallo addressed spending fatigue, writing, \"While it's logical for cyber fatigue in Palo Alto's mega deals, we haven't heard this from anywhere else,\" suggesting this was a company-specific issue.\n\nIt seems like a stretch to suggest that competitors will suffer due to Palo Alto's shift in strategy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zscaler scored two price target hikes from analysts. The first came courtesy of Truist, which maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its price target to $260, which would equate to roughly 20% upside after Wednesday's plunge. The analyst noted that after discussions within the industry, demand seems to have stabilized \"despite the challenging macro environment.\" UBS was even more bullish, keeping a buy rating and boosting its price target to $300, or upside potential of roughly 40%. That analyst suggested the environment was more positive than the company's conservative guidance suggests.\n\nIn the wake of Palo Alto's results, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci maintained a buy rating on SentinelOne shares while boosting its price target to $32, proposing potential upside of about 23%. The analyst said he expects another \"top-line beat and raise\" when the company reports early next month.\n\nGuggenheim was also bullish on CrowdStrike, with a buy rating and price target of $358, which would result in potential gains for investors of 23% from current levels. DiFucci believes CrowdStrike will \"grow faster and attain greater scale\" in the coming years, benefiting shareholders.\n\nThis is all a long way of suggesting that the fate of an industry doesn't rest on one company.\n\nTo be clear, none of these stocks is cheap by traditional valuation metrics. Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler currently trade at forward price-to-sales ratios of 15, 14, and 14, respectively, while Fortinet and SentinelOne each have forward price-to-sales ratios of 7.\n\nOf this quintet of stocks, CrowdStrike is the surest bet for my money. The company is still generating robust growth and has achieved the scale necessary to thrive.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Advisors Capital\u2019s JoAnne Feeney joins Yahoo Finance Live to outline what she calls \u201cthe three buckets\u201d for investors when assessing AI opportunities: chips enabling AI infrastructure, server manufacturers building that infrastructure, and software developers utilizing AI.\n\nEven if one area faces headwinds, like the chip slowdown, Feeney says firms servicing consumer use-cases like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others have \u201ca very long runway.\" She stresses as generative AI grows, more \"consumer-facing\" AI applications will arise, making those companies good plays.\n\nAs an example, Feeney highlights Palo Alto Networks (PANW) enhancing cybersecurity capabilities using AI for businesses. Despite recent guidance questions, she calls their strategic change \u201cvery smart\u201d. Feeney urges looking beyond short-term stock pressures, arguing any weakness presents \u201ca great opportunity\u201d to build positions in durable AI plays like Palo Alto.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Eventually, there is going to be a life after NVIDIA that we have to think about too in terms of some of the massive run up that we've seen. There's these different pillars of generative AI, where you've got the applications that sit on top of the language learning models, and those models that sit on top, of course, the chips powering the data centers as well.\n\nSo where is that next portfolio pivot, perhaps, that's still within generative AI, but is later on towards the consumer appreciation or realization of being able to have hands on some of these solutions?\n\nJOANNE FEENEY: Yeah. Right. So you've broken it down really nicely into-- think about three buckets. First, you've got the chips that make it possible to build the servers to run the AI training and inference models.\n\nThen you've got the folks building those servers and making those services available to, not just the consumer through, say, a ChatGPT, but also to other software companies that are then developing novel ways to use AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo there are three areas. You can say, OK, at some point, the growth in the sale of the chips may slow down, eventually. We're, I think, a long way from that given how much demand is sitting out there.\n\nBut then the consumer facing opportunities, we think, in companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and other potentially social media players or retail plays. So what are the consumer get out of using large language models like ChatGPT? So I think that the Microsofts and Amazons of the world are going to have a very long runway as more and more consumer facing applications get developed.\n\nAnd then the third bucket are software companies developing applications for, say, the business world, for how to run your factories better, for how to manage your operations more efficiently. Companies like ServiceNow, Snowflake, companies like Palo Alto, who are going to make cybersecurity smarter than it has been able to be in the past, which by the way, is a company we've owned for a long time, I think, since the last time its stock fell off a cliff.\n\nWe shouldn't read, by the way, too much into that slightly weaker forward guidance. We think the moves they're making here to change slightly their business model and their go-to market strategy is actually very smart from a perspective of getting over the big switching costs that their new potential customers face.\n\nSEANA SMITH: JoAnne, the drought that we're looking at here, off just about 25% pre-market, it sounds like you think it's an overreaction.\n\nJOANNE FEENEY: Oh, yeah. I really do. I think what you have is a lot of short-term holders that recognize that, hey, the next few months could be a little bit bumpy. They've clearly brought down their orders guidance. And I think that's really hurting the stock. And there are questions about how much growth they can generate in the next 6 to 12 months because of this shift in go-to market strategy.\n\nBut when you look into that shift, what does it portend for the future? And you see a lot more potential for the company to take market share, which, ultimately, is a very good thing for where they're going to end up in, say, two years.\n\nSo long-term holders should view this as an opportunity. If they've missed-- they feel like they've missed Palo Alto, this is a great opportunity to get in. They have a modest position. This might be a really good opportunity to increase the size of that position. Because, ultimately, this strategy that they've rolled out, they've talked about last night, is one that's going to help them gain market share with bigger contracts with longer duration.\n\nAnd it's going to be a little bit painful up front because they're going to basically give away some services while they're helping their new customers to transition. But, ultimately, it's a really good strategy.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. Well, we have seen some of that concern being stretched to some of their competitors out there. CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Zscaler, among those in the red today. And what you're saying might be an overreaction on those stocks as well.\n\nAll right. JoAnne Feeney, Advisors Capital Management Partner and Portfolio Manager, thanks so much for joining us here this morning.",

        "content": "Shares of Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) turned sharply lower Wednesday morning, falling as much as 27%. As of 10:44 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 25.9%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the cybersecurity specialist plunging was its quarterly financial report. While results were better than expected, the company announced a major change to its strategy that caught investors off guard.\n\nSolid results\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Jan. 31), Palo Alto Networks' revenue grew 19% year over year to $2 billion, fueled by existing customers increasing their spending. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that rose 39% to $1.46.\n\nTo give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $1.65 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.30, so Palo Alto Networks cleared both bars with room to spare.\n\nTotal billings -- or contractually obligated sales that haven't yet been booked as revenue -- provide insight into the company's future growth potential, and there appeared to be trouble on the horizon. Second-quarter billings increased to $2.35 billion, up 16% year over year. When billings grow more slowly than current revenue growth, this suggests a potential slump in future sales.\n\nA major strategic pivot\n\nCEO Nikesh Arora revealed a major shift in strategy that caught investors off guard. The company will offer increased incentives, including free product offers, in a bid to get customers to adopt more of its products and services. The resulting uncertainty had some investors running for the exits.\n\nIn keeping with its plans, management slashed its guidance. For its fiscal third quarter, executives are forecasting revenue in a range of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion, or year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. The company also expects diluted adjusted EPS of $1.25. Even more troubling was projected billings of $2.33 billion, or an uptick of just 3% at the midpoint. This suggests a rapid deceleration in growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, management is forecasting revenue of $8 billion, up roughly 15% year over year. Palo Alto Networks expects total billings of roughly $10.15 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would equal growth of about 11%.\n\nThis is a major shift in strategy, and it remains to be seen whether management can pull this off, which is why the stock plummeted.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palo Alto Networks wasn\u2019t one of them.

Catching a secular tailwind and then picking the stocks that will dominate that industry has been a sure way of compounding wealth in the market. This led us to create this list of millionaire-maker growth stocks.\n\nToday, the investment landscape presents several secular tailwinds offering millionaire-maker growth stocks. These markets are growing at unprecedented rates due to changes in consumer preferences, accelerating innovation and certain idiosyncratic factors. Notably, some of these markets are large enough to support multiple winners.\n\nLet\u2019s highlight some examples. First, we have the cybersecurity market that is growing as breaches and ransomware threats surge. McKinsey projects cyberattacks will lead to $10.5 trillion in damage annually by 2025. Given these challenges, the cybersecurity demand will grow 10.56% annually between 2023 and 2028, reaching $273.6 billion by 2028.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBesides cybersecurity, other growth opportunities include e-commerce, artificial intelligence, rising semiconductor content, and the shift to electric vehicles. Let\u2019s highlight three growth stocks that are plays on some of these secular trends.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRarely do you find top growth stocks at fire sale prices, but occasionally, the opportunity arises. As of this writing, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a buy after falling over 25% on February 21, after issuing a slight guidance miss.\n\nTaking things into perspective, this cybersecurity leader is one of the best-positioned growth stocks for the long term. Its platform offers security solutions in network security, cloud security and security operations. Across the three platforms, Palo Alto has been recognized as a leader in 21 categories by market research firms like Garter and Forrester. For instance, in December 2023, Gartner recognized the firm among the leaders in the Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to the leadership across multiple categories, the firm is seeing increasing customer interest. Moreover, organizations are moving away from disparate security solutions, preferring a single platform. This consolidation of security vendors is benefiting Palo Alto, which has the most comprehensive platform in cyber. As of the end of Q2 FY2024, 79% of Global 2000 companies were using at least two of its platforms and 57% were in all three.\n\nLooking at Q2 FY2024 results, revenues grew 19% year-over-year to $2 billion. Non-GAAP net income was $0.5 billion, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding 580 basis points to 29%. Despite these stellar numbers, Q3 guidance of $1.95 and $1.98 billion was below the consensus of $2.04 billion. This outlook disappointed market participants.\n\nInvestors are overacting and missing the bigger picture. First, management\u2019s decision to offer some free products is meant to capture longer-term platform contracts. Although the move will dent billings in the medium term, it will consolidate Palo Alto\u2019s position as the largest platform in cyber security. Secondly, the cybersecurity market is still growing its total addressable market, which will be a tailwind for PANW stock. Easily, this is one of the top millionaire-maker growth stocks.\n\nKKR (KKR) Man calculating finances on calculator. Finance. Finance stocks.\n\nSource: wutzkohphoto / Shutterstock\n\nThis private equity giant is not one of your typical growth darlings. However, given the rise of the alternative asset management industry, KKR (NYSE:KKR) is one of the growth stocks to watch in the financial sector.\n\nOver the last decade, demand for alternative asset classes like real estate, private credit and infrastructure has grown rapidly, benefiting KKR. Still, the industry sees more growth opportunities. For instance, private equity firms are targeting retail investors who currently have 1% to 2% allocated to alternatives compared to institutions at 25% to 30%. Increasing their assets from retail investors could be a tailwind for rising assets under management (AUM).\n\nKKR has set itself for success over the next decade. It has a strong track record in private credit, with more than $200 billion in AUM. Yet, the firm expects significant secular growth, especially in the asset-based finance market. Management estimates the ABF market at $5.2 trillion and expects it to exceed $7.7 trillion in five years.\n\nKKR has compounded revenues at 34.8% annually over the last five years. Management thinks they can double the business by riding the tailwinds of growth in the alternative asset management space. At 18 times forward earnings, it\u2019s one of the bargain growth stocks to buy.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is at the center of two major secular trends. The first trend is cloud migration, with public cloud spending rising 20.4% in 2024. The second is the rise of AI, which is increasing the amount of data generated, stored and processed. Organizations need Snowflake\u2019s data warehouse and data lake solutions that are interoperable in various cloud environments.\n\nSince its IPO, Snowflake has delivered a stunning 70% compounded annual revenue growth rate. It will keep up the above sector growth rate due to the AI opportunity. Management notes that many organizations need a data strategy for AI. In line with perspective, they have introduced Snowflake Cortex to leverage machine learning and AI on Snowflake.\n\nA major hurdle for organizations implementing AI has been access to quality data. Snowflake\u2019s data-sharing architecture addresses this challenge. By the end of Q3 FY2024, 28% of all customers were sharing data on the platform. Another product, Snowflake Horizon, offers a unified security and governance solution purposely for AI.\n\nSnowflake is still one of the top growth stocks as it continues to win workloads. The company highlighted its strengths in Q3 FY2024 results with revenue of $698 million, representing 34% YOY growth. What\u2019s more, net revenue retention was 135%, highlighting the stickiness of Snowflake\u2019s platform.\n\nOrganizations using AI are generating more data, creating demand for Snowflake\u2019s tools. With 647 of Forbes Global 2000 as customers, this data warehouse and data lake company has shown the critical nature of its solutions.

Nvidia really needs to not only beat, but have a very strong forecast for it to reaccelerate to the upside.\" The chipmaker has jumped 38.2% so far this year, compared with 5.7% and 3.6% year-to-date gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nFive of the 11 major S&P sectors eased in early trading, with rate-sensitive technology stocks down 1%.\n\nThe AI-fueled rally on Wall Street this year ran into a rough patch after data last week hinted at sticky inflation and stoked concerns that the Federal Reserve could delay the start of its rate easing cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe January inflation data complicates upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin said on Wednesday.\n\nMinutes from the Fed's January monetary policy meeting, due at 1400 ET (1900 GMT), will offer further clues on the timing of potential interest rate cuts.\n\nA majority of traders are currently pricing in June as the starting point for rate easing, compared with March at the start of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nAt 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 104.68 points, or 0.27%, at 38,459.12, the S&P 500 was down 10.96 points, or 0.22%, at 4,964.55, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 69.03 points, or 0.44%, at 15,561.76.\n\nAdding to the declines, Palo Alto Networks slumped 25.4% after the cybersecurity firm forecast third-quarter billings below Wall Street estimates, signaling cautious spending by businesses.\n\nShares of other cybersecurity companies such as Fortinet , Zscaler and Crowdstrike Holdings fell between 7% and 14%.\n\nAmazon.com gained 1.7%, with the company set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective next week, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance. Shares of Walgreens slid 3.5%.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.08-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 18 new highs and 30 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Bansari Mayur Kamdar; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)",

Keefe Bruyette upgraded HomeTrust (HTBI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $32 price target on valuation. The firm has \"long admired\" the company's attractive southeast markets, its ongoing transition to a thriving commercially focused banking franchise, its steps towards higher profitability, its scarcity value, and its numerous strategic changes and improvements. Craig-Hallum upgraded Hackett Group(HCKT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $28, up from $25, citing revenue and adjusted EPS that were ahead of expectations. While Craig-Hallum has modestly lowered its Q1 estimates, it expects the current efforts regarding Generative AI to drive stronger growth rates in the back half of the year. Jefferies upgraded COPT Defense Properties(CDP) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $28, up from $26. The firm sees potential for a \"beat-and-raise story\" with consensus still below the midpoint of the 2024 guidance, which it says should help re-rate the stock trading in line with traditional office. Zelman upgraded Armstrong World(AWI) to Outperform from Neutral. The firm cites the company's through-the-cycle EPS growth.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nNorthland downgraded Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to Market Perform from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $275. April quarter billings guidance came in 1300 basis points below consensus, which embeds federal continues to underperform prior expectations and layers in the near-term negative impact of platformization, says the firm in a post-earnings note. Piper Sandler, Rosenblatt and Loop Capital also downgraded Palo Alto Networks to Neutral-equivalent ratings.  HSBC downgraded Home Depot(HD) to Reduce from Hold with an unchanged price target of $323. The company's Q4 results were basically in line with estimates, but its sales momentum \"remains poor, weighing on short-term profitability,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan downgraded Wendy's(WEN) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $19, down from $22, following the Q4 report. The stock is likely to remain range-bound in an industry where price promotion and capital intensity across the category is likely to increase, the firm says. JPMorgan downgraded Vizio (VZIO) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $11.50, up from $10, after Walmart (WMT) announced an agreement to acquire the company for $11.50 per share in cash. Craig-Hallum and Roth MKM also downgraded Vizio to Neutral-equivalent ratings. Wolfe Research downgraded Discover Financial (DFS) to Peer Perform from Outperform without a price target saying the pending takeover by Capital One (COF) should close. RBC Capital also downgraded Discover Financial to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $140, up from $117.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nScotiabank initiated coverage of UiPath (PATH) with a Sector Perform rating and $29 price target. The firm says the company's opportunities come with challenges, namely a dynamic end-market and rising competition. It waits for a better entry point before recommending shares. Stifel initiated coverage of Confluent (CFLT) with a Buy rating and $40 price target. Confluent's real-time data streaming platform, built on open-source software Kafka and Flink, plays \"a pivotal role in the ongoing secular trend of modernizing data architectures as more companies view data as a core asset,\" says the firm. Stifel initiated coverage of AnaptysBio (ANAB) with a Buy rating and $50 price target. The firm believes that immune cell modulation represents \"a key part of the evolution in the treatment paradigm of autoimmune disease\" and calls AnaptysBio \"uniquely positioned\" with two ongoing Phase 2b studies for lead PD-1 and BTLA agonist programs in Rheumatoid Arthritis, or RA, and Atopic Dermatitis, or AD, which are set to read out in mid-2025 and by year-end 2024, respectively. Benchmark initiated coverage of ChargePoint(CHPT) with a Buy rating and $4.25 price target. ChargePoint's \"land-and-expand approach\" of selling EV charging hardware that is further connected via Cloud Services subscriptions has helped it build \"an industry leading charging network\" that is positioned to capitalize on market growth as the industry matures, the firm tells investors. JPMorgan initiated coverage of World Kinect(WKC) with a Neutral rating and $25 price target. The firm thinks upside exists in World Kinect's Aviation business due to the continued recovery of air travel off of COVID lows, but says this dynamic is properly reflected in consensus estimates and in the share price.",

I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nStory continues\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThank you, Walter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I am pleased to report another quarter in which we successfully executed our profitable growth strategy, driving a combination of top line growth, significant expansion in non-GAAP operating margin and strong free cash flow generation.\r\nRevenues grew 19% year-over-year and RPO grew 22%, capturing the full value of our future revenue. Billings grew 16% year-over-year. Just as important as we focus on profitable growth, we again delivered substantial operating margin leverage and strong growth in free cash flow. Non-GAAP operating margins of 28.6% expanded nearly 600 basis points year-over-year and we generated $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.\r\nOur strong profitability drove non-GAAP EPS of $1.46, up 39% year-over-year and our GAAP net income continues to grow meaningfully, even without onetime items. Beyond our financial results, we achieved a number of notable milestones in Q2 worthy of spotlighting. We continue to drive larger deals, including a steady stream of $1 million-plus deals and success in our largest deals with 10 transactions over $20 million in the quarter. Our 10 highest spending customers in Q2 increased their spend with us by 36% in the period.\r\nI also wanted to update you on key achievements across our 3 platforms. In our Network Security business, we continue to see progress driving ARR growth in our SASE business. Q2 was our fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth. Additionally, more than 30% of our new SASE customers we signed in the second quarter were new to Palo Alto Networks, showing that we can win head-to-head in the market when leading with SASE. We continue to drive innovation in network security, refreshing our high-end 7500 cities platform and investing new OT security capabilities, which garnered a net new leadership position for us.\r\nIn Prisma Cloud, we have made significant investments in the first half of the year to drive new customers and saw this pay off in Q2 with our highest new ACV growth in 5 quarters. We continue to see strong trends in multi-module adoption with approximately 30% growth in customers with 2 or more modules and approximately 60% growth in customers with 3 or more modules. Additionally, about 1/4 of our customers are using 5 or more modules. Our external recognition in this market continued with Forrester Research, positioning us as a leader in its Cloud Workload Security Wave report.\r\nIn Cortex, XSIAM continues to be a significant catalyst for large transactions and growth across the business. It is evidenced by ARR for XSIAM customers being more than 5x higher than that of Cortex customers who have not yet adopted XSIAM. We've seen significant progress in the milestone with XSIAM in Q2 including the most number of deals signed in a single quarter and bookings of over $90 million again this quarter.\r\nWe've already displaced 19 different SIM vendors to date and the confidence under our belt, we're now looking systematically on how we can accelerate this legacy SIM displacement.\r\nFrom a regional perspective, demand overall is healthy. We did see softness in the U.S. Federal Government market. We are positioned well for several large projects where we had requisite certifications and 1 technical selection, but these deals did not close. The situation started off towards the end of Q1 were worsened in Q2. And as a result, we had a significant shortfall in our U.S. federal government business. We expect this trend will continue into our Q3 and Q4. Offsetting the billing weakness in Fed was some non-product backlog that we shipped this quarter.\r\nWith several leadership positions awarded in second quarter, including our addition as a leader of the Gartner Endpoint Protection Magic Quadrant, we're now a recognized leader in 21 different categories across our 3 platforms. Five years ago when we began our strategy, the industry believed building leadership across multiple categories wasn't possible. No one was talking about security platform. Instead, the world was best of breed. Our success over the last 5 years has been driven by the shift to platformization. We're committed to investing in innovation to extend our industry leadership position and platform.\r\nThis unique leadership across our 3 markets is driving strong adoption of our platforms in our target Global 2000 markets. As of Q2, 79% of Global 2000 have transacted with us on at least 2 of our platforms and 57% in all 3. This is up from 73% and 47% 2 years ago. In most of these accounts, while they have adopted products from multiple platforms, we are early in driving each of our platforms wall to wall. This is a major area of focus for us as we move forward, driving consolidation within our 3 platforms. We know this is the right strategy and see compelling economics of multi-platform wins. Our 2 platform customers have an average customer lifetime value that is more than 5 times that of our single platform customer. For our 3 platform customers, that is more than 40x larger.\r\nWhile we are driving platformization, I personally think we should be doing this faster. Not only is this showing up in our deal statistics, but as we have established the portion of our platforms -- position of our platform, we're now seeing significant progress in consolidating vendors in our customer environments. We've built our Zero Trust platform through a consistent architecture across our appliance, software and SASE form factors. Customers can now consistently manage security policy across these form factors and then leverage a consistent set of security subscriptions to consolidate network security capabilities. These capabilities provided by point vendors can include intrusion prevention, web proxies, URL filtering, SD-WAN and DLP just to name a few.\r\nIn Q2, we saw Zero Trust consolidation wins that included a large U.S. manufacturing company standardizing on our network security platform in a $40 million transaction, replacing end of life competitive hardware, leveraging our security subscription that are moving a point competitor in SSE. We were the only company with the right certifications across all these offerings that could support their broad geographic footprint.\r\nThis deal was part of a consolidation and modernization effort across IT with positive ROI for the customer. We also had a 7-figure deal with a large law firm, expanding our firewall footprint in the new data center and expanding their hybrid workforce initiatives with Prisma Access. As part of this, we won versus other firewall and SSE competitors and also consolidate their URL filtering and VPN capabilities.\r\nIn Prisma Cloud, we have built a go-to cloud platform combining key best-of-breed capabilities that we have acquired or developed organically. Our common architecture and user experience spreads across 12 modules. As our customers adopt multiple modules, they can consolidate a wide variety of vendors, including those in cloud security posture management, cloud workload protection, API security, SCA or software composition analysis and infrastructure as code security amongst others.\r\nIn Q2, we closed a 7-figure Prisma Cloud new logo deal with a financial services company, displacing multiple incumbent vendors. The customer was looking for CNAPP solution to support their multi-cloud journey. The Prisma Cloud CNAPP streamlined several previously deployed point solutions and tools.\r\nWe also closed a 7-figure renew and expand deal with the leading North American technology company, where the customer intends to expand the use of Prisma Cloud to 7 modules and also value the consolidation and standardization delivered through Prisma Cloud.\r\nFinally, in our Cortex platform with our autonomous security operations platform, XSIAM, we were able to establish our offering, which has enabled us to accelerate platform value proposition with Cortex. A platform approach in the SOC is becoming a customer imperative as point products each of their own data stores cannot have full context, nor drive appropriate action without overly complex integration and high people cost.\r\nIn Q2, we saw consolidation wins that include a large insurance company that renew the subscription and support of firewalls at the same time added XSIAM and expanse capability for a $25 million transaction. The XSIAM choice displays the 2 leading EDR and SIM competitors in the market, enable the customer to avoid the cost of adding other point products in their stock.\r\nAdditionally, in Q2, we saw follow-on consolidation success with the Japanese manufacturing company. They had previously consolidated their network security across our SASE capabilities, leveraging Prisma Access in our DLP and CASB capabilities. The customer then added XSOAR into their SOC and expressed an interest in consolidating further. In Q2, they added XSIAM in a mid-7-figure deal.\r\nI know if you've had a chance to look at our guidance. Our guidance is not a consequence of a change in the demand outlook out there. Our guidance is a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in wanting to accelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leadership. We believe this is the time for us to invest, given our leadership position in the market and our leadership position across platformization and consolidation.\r\nBut before I talk about that more as to how we intend to accelerate our growth prospects in the future, and drive towards a much higher aspiration of $15 billion in ARR by 2030, I want to give you a candid view of where we see the cybersecurity market and the demand function out there.\r\nThe demand story is no different from prior quarters and the margin continues to get stronger. There are multiple drivers fueling this. The threat landscape continues to challenge our customers with increasing scale and sophistication of attacks. I'm personally getting calls from CEOs and members of Boards that have had bad incidents as well as those that have seen their peers adversely impacted. We're increasingly focusing on working with companies impacted by breaches, an important commitment as we continue to be the leader in this space.\r\nLast quarter, we offered 1,500 of our top customers an opportunity to get our pre-support during a breach. Surprisingly, 400 customers have signed up in the last 90 days out of 1,500 to get our help on this topic. Clearly, there is awareness and concern around cybersecurity as has never been before. Heightened geopolitical tensions are driving significant nation state activity with national infrastructure being targeted. Successful breaches and ransomware attacks are being perpetrated across many industries and we see a few repercussions of those attacks. Although we did see various law enforcement agencies this morning or over the weekend shut down lock pit, which is a promising sign.\r\nThe new SEC mandate requires prompt disclosure material incidents, which often result in companies reporting those incidents before a full assessment can be done or incidents remediated .We see some companies making several disclosures in succession as they grapple with understanding the full extent of what they are facing. We see the results of these disclosure mandates recognizing the need for expedited action and security visibility and remediation in (inaudible).\r\nThe part that is new, despite the many demand drivers we're seeing, we're beginning to notice customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity. This is new. As adding incremental point products is not necessarily driving a better security outcome for them. This is driving a greater focus on ROI and total cost of ownership amongst most customers.\r\nThere are also some key trends within the industry that I think are worth highlighting. Palo Alto Networks is unique in seeing gains in market share in hardware firewalls or in the product space. This market is changing rapidly with us seeing some of our competitors who had introduced price increases begin to roll them back. From our advantage point, we see the share shift happening in our favor because we see customers consolidating into our Zero Trust platform. Customers, as I mentioned, 30% net new network security customers for SASE or new to Palo Alto. Those are the customers who over time go ahead and consolidate their footprint and require our firewalls to be deployed to give them a consistent zero-trust architecture.\r\nWe see this as a promising trend. We intend to accelerate that opportunity. Along with the incremental focus on ROI and TCO, the single product vendor is having challenges in articulating compelling value. They're also forced to have platformization narrative. When they're not able to convince the customers that their strategy is competitive, they are many times resorting to uneconomic pricing and putting pressure on transactions in this manner. We're beginning to see rogue behavior by some vendors in the space who are keen to retain their customers, primarily in the legacy vendor space and the startup space. We intend to combat that with investing in this space and trying to accelerate platformization and consolidation for our customers.\r\nWe're also seeing increased demand for AI along with deploying AI in our products or big DCR customers asking us to help them protect for a successful and responsible deployment of AI in their infrastructure. Putting this all together, these trends of the market bolster our conviction that adopting platforms is the only viable strategy for customers and leveraging AI is imperative. We want to match faster to our aspiration to become the Salesforce, to become the ServiceNow or the Workday of cybersecurity. Customers have adopted platforms in other markets across technology, and this will inevitably happen in cybersecurity. These industry trends set up conditions that favor leaders that can drive consolidation. We intend to answer this challenge.\r\nWith all the promise that platformization holds, adoption is not always easy for many of our customers. Until now, we have primarily assumed that our customers adopt our platforms in their own pace. The crux of challenge is around execution. Customers face risk in executing or making significant changes to their environments as well economic exposure from these changes. Key friction points we've noticed include the challenge of replacing multiple products simultaneously as well as the issues around double playing while working through complex contract terms.\r\nOver the last 6 months, we have been quietly working to develop programs that enable us to help minimize and even share in the risk of our customer space. You will see us tomorrow launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers to help drive this consolidation and platformization strategy. We believe we can build customer confidence in our platforms by approaching them well before their point product contracts expire. After we gain their contractual commitment, we have offered an extended rollout period where we can demonstrate our ability to deliver these platform benefits. Customers can then start paying us after the obligation of legacy vendors ends.\r\nWith the experience we have gained over the last 6 months, we believe now is the right time to accelerate programs across our portfolio to drive this platformization. All these programs will have mechanisms to reduce customer friction, accelerate product deployment, help customers realize the value of our platforms and consume new innovation sooner. While this is not an exhaustive list, I wanted to give you some examples.\r\nWe have begun to launch programs already that include legacy trade-ins, no cost introductory offers and product add-ons and incentives to accelerate estate standardization. Each of these programs is elements of reducing execution risk and dealing with economic exposure that concern our customers. In that sense, we must bear the cost of the transition through lower upfront financial outcomes, but we are convinced these will yield amazing outcomes for us in the mid- to long term.\r\nWe have developed these programs across all 3 platforms. And as I mentioned, we intend -- we have announced a few and we intend to announce more starting tomorrow in addition to expanding some of the programs that we already have.\r\nGiven this is an investor call, and you're all focused on these numbers, I want to provide you a high-level understanding of the aggregate impact we expect this will have in the medium term and long term. I will then have Dipak talk more about this in his section and explain this much more eloquently and elaborately.\r\nWe expect a typical customer entering into a platformization transaction will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth over the next 12 to 18 months. As customers move into the period where contracts of full billing and revenue contribution, we expect to see an acceleration in our top line metrics. Beyond this dip and acceleration in our top line metrics, we believe we can sustain higher growth rates for longer, driven by sticky and broad platform relationships with incremental customers, allowing us to aspire to goal of $15 billion in next-generation security in 2030.\r\nWe also expect to achieve our transformation to a business with greater than 90% recurring revenue and industry-leading non-GAAP operating margins in the low to mid-30s. As Dipak will explain, we believe we can do this in a financially prudent and strong manner.\r\nTalking about bigger platforms and ARR aspirations cannot be done today without talking about AI. We have been working on AI for a long time as a company. However, we did accelerate our efforts with the arrival of Generative AI. I personally believe AI is going to be one of the biggest inflection points in technology in over a decade and likely, more importantly, to significantly increase the total addressable market in cybersecurity.\r\nGartner predicts by 2027, $300 billion will be spent on the AI software. This AI juggernaut continues to bring several challenges along with it from a security perspective, multiple vectors of attacks, ranging from fishing to malware to nation state activity had inflected negatively due to AI. Furthermore, customers are evaluating dozens of co-pilots type offerings for their end users, where security is not necessarily front and center. \r\nWe see 3 discrete opportunities to drive additional growth in cybersecurity through AI and we have internally put pen to paper to understand this opportunity and we're in alpha or beta stages of many of these across our product capabilities.\r\nFirst, organizations are concerned about their employees access to AI in an insecure manner. Where as a consequence of unintended leakage of open source, other data models tampering or AI-driven fishing, we see an opportunity to add value across the growing volume of users we secure. We currently secured north of 100 million users and their access to applications both in the public cloud and in the data center. We expect each of these users is an opportunity for us to deliver an AI security sub for them. We believe it's a $3 billion to $5 billion opportunity over the next 5 years.\r\nSecondly, organizations are increasingly deploying AI-related workloads in the cloud, just like they need to understand the overall security posture of their cloud estates and expeditiously identify immediate issues. They must do this for AI-related workloads. We believe this in itself is a $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next 5 years. Lastly, network traffic will increasingly have an AI context with interactions and transactions between applications and AI models.\r\nOur more than 0.5 million installed firewalls is the perfect place to inspect this traffic. We believe this is a $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next 5 years. Overall, this combined $13 million to $17 million opportunity drives our conviction that investing in AI and maintaining our leadership can help us accelerate our growth towards $15 billion by 2030.\r\nBeyond the large opportunity, we also believe we are uniquely positioned to garner our fair share of the TAM. Our proprietary data and large technology footprint is a significant advantage in driving AI outcomes.\r\nWe've already seen the early benefits of this AI in our newly developed product offerings. In Q2, our AI offerings, which include XSIAM, Autonomous Digital Experience Management, or ADEM and AI ops crossed $100 million in ARR milestone. We are possibly the first security companies to cross $100 million ARR in AI security. This is above and beyond the AI capabilities we have embedded across all of our platforms, including our advanced subscriptions and our Code-to-Cloud platforms.\r\nOur co-pilots are an alpha and are in the hands of leading customers who are giving us feedback before we move to general availability. Looking forward, we have aggressive plans to roll out additional AI-based offerings by the end of this fiscal year. We have plans to offer 3 new product offerings, 1 to address each of the stance I talked about. \r\nBefore I wrap up and pass it on to Dipak, I'd like to summarize. We have established our platformization notion, our clear industry leadership position with our best-of-breed platforms and the industry trends convince us, we're in the best position to capitalize on this early trend and now focus on the next phase of cybersecurity, which is going to be all about consolidation.\r\nOne of the hardest things to do is to change the strategy that is working. We have spent time understanding how to accelerate our strategy further. We firmly believe as a management team that the changes we are making today are going to give us better prospects in the mid- to long term and allow us to drive this consolidation much faster whilst giving our customers better ROI and total cost of ownership. AI is an opportunity early stages. However, we are seeing the signs that there is significant demand there. It will prove to be an inflection point for cybersecurity and today will be marked as a day where we will see that inflection begin to take hold as we start to deliver more AI security products over the course of the rest of the year.\r\nWe have confidence we can drive our top line growth trajectory higher for longer ahead of the growth trajectory we talked about back in August despite absorbing some short-term impacts. We have shown we run the business in a financial prudent manner, which we will continue to do as we drive this acceleration, hitting our original operating profitability and cash flow margin targets.\r\nWith that, I will pass on to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Given all that we have to talk about this quarter, I will do an abbreviated review of our Q2 results. You can refer to the press release and supplemental financial information on our website for our key numbers.\r\nFor Q2, revenue of $1.98 billion grew 19%. Product revenue grew 11% while total service revenue grew 22% with subscription revenue growing 26% and support revenue growing 14%.\r\nMoving on to geographies. We saw consistent revenue growth across all of our theaters with the Americas growing 19%, EMEA up 19%, and APAC also growing 19%. We had some puts and takes during the quarter related to billings. As Nikesh mentioned, we saw weakness in the U.S. federal vertical related to some specific programs. This U.S. federal weakness was a meaningful headwind to our billings in Q2 after we saw a slow start in the year to Fed. The impact of the federal deals on our revenue is significant as they are relatively shorter than our average contract term. At the same time, we saw a decrease in our non-backlog, which offset the Fed weakness in our billings. We continue to see customers closely watching cash outlays around deals, which we discussed last quarter, although this trend played out largely as we expected 90 days ago.\r\nRemaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $10.8 billion, and current RPO was $5.2 billion. You likely notice that our GAAP EPS was $4.89 and GAAP net income was $1.75 billion. These benefited from a $1.5 billion release of a tax-related valuation allowance. This was a onetime item in fiscal year '24, which has been adjusted out of our non-GAAP results. This amount also does not impact our cash taxes. Our average duration on new contracts was relatively flat year-over-year with average duration for new contracts remaining at approximately 3 years, while total contract duration was down slightly year-over-year.\r\nI did want to spend more time talking about our accelerated platformization and consolidation strategy and give you more of my perspective with some additional framing and detail with the financial lens. Nikesh talked about our programs to alleviate friction with customers. We believe that by moving from a deal-by-deal approach to a program-based and systematic approach, we can accelerate platformization with our customer base and drive then the consolidation faster by mitigating platformization friction. This results in a number of business benefits for us ranging from a faster capture of the customer estate and larger platform commitment to higher renewal and expansion rates and faster adoption of our new innovations.\r\nFor the customer, they are able to execute on the platform deployment with lower risk and consolidate vendors while benefiting from a lower cost -- total cost of ownership and the better security posture. As Nikesh gave you the high-level trajectory in our pipeline, I want to help you understand how we think about the medium term. Our platformization offers to drive consolidation effectively provide customers a period of the contract for free as part of their commitment. We expect we may see a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top line growth rate, notably billings. Some of our platformization programs embed deferred payments into deal structures, which we have spoken about in the past. We expect this will persist through fiscal year '25 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs and result in billings below the target we provided in August of 2023.\r\nBeyond this period, we expect we can sustain higher growth than we provided in these targets in August.\r\nFrom an NGS ARR perspective, we expect less impact on our year-end metrics, and we expect we can continue to meet or exceed our target, which calls for 30% growth rate through fiscal year '26. As Nikesh noted, we are establishing a long-term target of $15 billion of NGS ARR in fiscal year '30. Underlying this trend, we expect customers deploying our full set of platforms to have a higher makeup of NGS products. These offerings tend to be deeply installed in our customers' infrastructure and once a customer deploys the platform, it's easier to continue to consolidate vendors and adopt new innovations. We expect this to drive a significant increase in our overall revenue mix that is recurring.\r\nFrom a revenue perspective, we expect to see less pressure on revenue as compared to billings. Generally, we see a lag in changes in our revenue growth versus our billings growth, and we expect that this will happen here as well. As Nikesh mentioned, part of what gives us confidence to execute on the strategy and especially to do so now, is our success in driving profitable growth. As we embark on a strategy that we expect will negatively impact the top line in the short term, we have significant confidence that our business scales well and we can continue to see operating leverage from a number of drivers.\r\nAs I have mentioned multiple times before, we scale well across every line item of our P&L, ranging from customer support, the cloud hosting, the sales and marketing to G&A. And we've seen significant payoff from focusing on internal efficiency across all areas of the business. Let me give you some specific examples for Q2. First, in cloud hosting, we signed a significant extension with our primary cloud provider. This contract is constructed to enable us to drive further margin benefits as we scale. Second, within G&A, we're progressing well on a significant employee experience program. This started by analyzing all of our service desk tickets across all channels and identifying all the manual responses needed to address requests. The combination of process reengineering, automation and AI is still in progress, but we have already seen positive savings and have a target of automating 90% of the more than 300,000 manual interventions.\r\nBy the end of Q2, we roughly halved the cost of our T&E servicing. We are now leveraging this program as a template across other business areas. In short, whilst we made a lot of progress, we still have significant opportunities on the profitability front. That gives us confidence that we can maintain our medium-term operating margin and free cash margin targets beyond this year. Specifically, we believe that we can expand our operating margins by 100 basis points beyond this year in line with the operating margin guidance we gave in August of 28% to 29%. And this can continue to support our medium-term free cash flow margin target of 37% plus. We expect that this will come despite us absorbing some billings impact as we have both the benefit of some prior arrangements with deferred payments contributing as well as efforts we have placed on optimizing the cash dynamics of our vendor spending.\r\nIn short, I wanted to reiterate what Nikesh said that it is important for us to be able to manage through this platformization acceleration in a financially prudent manner, and we have set ourselves up well to do this over the next 12 to 18 months.\r\nNow moving on to the guidance for Q3 and the year. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.30 billion to $2.35 billion, an increase of 2% to 4%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion, an increase of 13% to 15%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26, an increase of 13% to 15%.\r\nFor the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.10 billion to $10.20 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 35%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, an increase of 15% to 16%. We expect operating margins to be in the range 26.5% to 27%, an increase of 240 to 290 basis points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.55, an increase of 23% to 25%. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 38% to 39%. \r\nIn the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nThanks. We'll now proceed with Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Hamza Fodderwala from Morgan Stanley, followed by Brian Essex from JPMorgan.\n\nHamza Fodderwala\n\nI just wanted to clarify, Nikesh, your comment on spending fatigue. What exactly were you referring to there, just given -- you also said demand was quite good. And then just the billings cut, it seems like it's a function of some bundling discounting as well as lower duration. Any way to quantify that at all?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThanks, Hamza. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think I want to make sure there's no confusion in our characterization of spending fatigue. Over the last few years, most of our customers have ended up spending more on cybersecurity than on IT. As a consequence, they're feeling like my budget for cybersecurity keeps going up in double digits every year because I'm trying to protect against every new threat vector, yet you see the number of breaches continues to rise. So our customers are sitting down and saying, if I spend more money, can you show me how I get a lower total cost of ownership across my enterprise? How do I spend less on the services that I have to deploy? And how do we get better ROI.\r\nSo I think it's more about optimizing their current cybersecurity budgets as opposed to there being no demand. Demand continues to be very strong. The customers are demanding to get more for the amount of money they have allocated to cybersecurity. That's where platformization consolidation kicks in. In terms of trying to quantify duration versus...\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nSo just to be clear, Hamza, from a billings perspective, part of the billings guidance is related to the Fed that we talked about in the prepared remarks, part of it is also because of the platform initiatives -- platformization initiatives per se, but also part of it is we just expect there to be more deferred payments like annual billings, things like that as we roll out these programs. That's what makes it up.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thank you, Hamza. Next question is from Brian Essex at JPMorgan, followed by Saket Kalia at Barclays.\n\nBrian Lee Essex\n\nYes. Maybe to follow up on Hamza's question. Maybe for Dipak, one thing that caught my ear was the comment about discounting or offering a free period upfront for a certain period of time. Wanted to get a sense of what kind of headwind within that billings guidance is attributable to some of that discounting? And should we be looking at other metrics like average TCV or annualized TCV to get a sense of once those contracts hit a normal run rate, what would a normalized growth rate look like?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThanks, Brian. Let me jump in here. I think let me clarify in terms of the discounting notion. What's happening today is when I go to a customer and say, listen, I'd like to replace your estate with the entire platform. The customer says, \"Wait, wait a minute, I got this vendor for IPS, this for SD-WAN, this for SSC. And I got half of my firewalls from another vendor, and they all expire at different points in time. I'd love to deploy Zero Trust but it's going to take me 2, 3 years as the end of life, so these vendors happen. And I'm scared that if I rip and replace this at this point in time, is going to create execution risk, not just that, it's going to hit economic risk.\"\r\nSo the propositions we're going to customers is, listen, let's lay out a 2-year, 3-year cybersecurity consolidation and platformization plan. We'll go start implementing today, you pay us when they're done. So what it is, is more of a sort of like you can use our services until you have to keep paying the other vendor, we'll take it from there. But that's taking away a lot of the economic exposure and the execution risk for our customers. Now you can call that discount or you can call that a free offer. Our estimate is approximately it works out at about 6 months' worth of free product capabilities to our customers on a rolling basis. I think in about 12 months, as our offers start lapping each other, we should go back to our growth rate we've been talking about. And I think the right metric is the time frame is to look at RPO.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nThank you, Brian. Next question from Andy Nowinski at Wells Fargo, followed by Gabriela Borges at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAndrew James Nowinski\n\nI wanted to ask about the U.S. federal spending. You said it was soft in Q2, Nikesh and I think it's going to remain soft for the next 6 months. But given your comments about how nation state activity targeting the national infrastructure was increasing, I guess, why do you think there's a disconnect between that trend? And were those comments specific to your Palo Alto customers in the U.S. Fed are more broad-based?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nLook, part of it is particular to us. As you are aware, there was a large program. We were part of down selected to be the only vendor. We'd expected and we staffed it to make sure we could implement it and we could get the orders. That program didn't materialize at the pace and at the spending levels we had expected. We saw an early glimpse in Q1 towards the end, we saw it not show up in Q2, and we have it staffed for Q3 and Q4. Remember, Fed is a lower duration number. So it has a much more significant impact to revenue because Fed pays on an annualized basis as opposed to a TCV basis.\r\nSo you're seeing the impact of that to our revenue for Q3 and Q4 and some of the billings miss in Q2, which we had to make up with shipping from non-product backlog. So that's kind of what happened in the Fed business. One's bidding, twice shy. So we're being very cautious about how we expect it to come back or not in the second half of the year. So it's more pertinent to that as opposed to a broader comment around the federal space. And don't forget, Fed is, in general, is not a next-generation security adopter because they're usually slower on cloud services than they are on traditional cybersecurity products.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nThanks, Andy, Apologies. We're going to go back to Saket Kalia from Barclays and then go to Gabriela Borges from Goldman.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nGreat. Nikesh, maybe for you, just to touch on the platformization item a little bit deeper. I almost think about these as ramping contracts and you tell me if that's off. But specifically, as you look at the second half, maybe putting the mechanics of the ramp aside, how do you sort of feel about sort of underlying demand with metrics like ACV or bookings and what percentage of your book of business do you sort of expect to shift to sort of this ramping structure? Does that make sense?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nYes, yes, that makes a lot of sense. I think part of what we're noticing, Saket, is that we'd like to go from best-of-breed competitive behavior with legacy vendors or New Year vendors and go straight to platform competition. Because you noticed that we have a higher win rate on platform deals. We have a higher win rate and consolidation plays as opposed to best-of-breed head ones, which end up costing more time and energy and you see very, I call it rogue behavior where people start trying to desperately hold on to customers.\r\nSo we are trying to shift our go-to-market towards a consolidation in play and a platform play. I think, as I said to earlier, the right number to look at in this context is RPO. The underlying demand is strong. Our book of business is strong. Our pipeline is strong. There is nothing going on in the demand side. It's just that we see this pushing out of the billings towards later parts as we get more and more consolidation offers and platform offers out there.\r\nTo give you an example, when we acquired Talon, we made Talon free to every SASE customer, right? Is there going and trying to upsell that every SASE customer and run the risk of running the POCs or other secure browsers. We've decided to give it away free for the next 12 months until the customer's renewal comes up. Now that has a billing impact in the 12-month time frame and revenue impact. However, at the end of 12 months, all these will be renewed because our aspiration is to get 50% of our customers to use the enterprise browser.\r\nIt's one of the best products we've acquired. It has tremendous market tractions. When we acquired it, there were 100 POCs in place going on at customers. And we told them, listen, if you're a Palo Alto customer, just use it. It's part of our product. It's part of the licensing. You don't have to pay us more, you don't have to do a new contract. What that does, it allows us to penetrate a market segment which would end up being competitive, we end up getting some share and spend the rest of our lives trying to create more traction and more market share in the future. Is that great. It's free.\r\nOur incident response offer. We never had 400 Fortune 2000 customers dealing with us on incident response. We launched an offer, in 90 days, we've got 400 customers. We gave them 250 hours free, right? That's 100,000 hours of breach consulting for free but that drives a future business for us where they become a cybersecurity partner of choice. So we're trying to seed ourselves into our customers' platform and consolidation strategies so that we don't have to keep fighting on individual best-of-breed deal every time we go to a customer.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks, Saket. We're going to go next to Gabriela Borges with Fatima Boolani from Citi on deck.\n\nGabriela Borges\n\nNikesh, I wanted to ask how you think about the risk of potentially cannibalizing the customers that are willing to pay full price today as you implement the bundling strategy? And then how do you think about...\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nIf you find then let me know. Sorry, go ahead, please ask the question. How do you...\n\nGabriela Borges\n\nYes. It's helpful, a longer-term question on how do you think about maybe catalyzing a race to the bottom with pricing pressure. So as you think about ramp deals, technology that maybe was $100 today or a year from now, by the time you get to renewal, is no longer worth $100 because you've created pricing competition or you've created a competitive response.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI think there are 2 answers -- let me answer 2 parts of the question. I think this is -- to think about it as a price war is a wrong way to think about it. Actually, we're averting a price war by driving a platformization approach. I will explain how.\r\nFirst of all, all of our customer deals are discussed, negotiated POC. So it's very rarely that we have a customer who does not understand the value of what they're offering. Because the competitive market, we have a price. Our competitors -- normally rational competitors have a price. So we don't think that we're cannibalizing a full price paying customer possibly. I think what we are doing, Gabriela is that we're avoiding the unintended consequence where a customer says, oops, I have no time left. Because what happens to customers with all the right intentions we'll say, I'll renew, I'll buy Power Auto in 12 months from now when my current contract goes away. They take a little while analyzing and they get to 6 months my God, if I'm not able to deploy you in 6 months, I'm going to have an exposure, so I'm going to go try and get a renewal.\r\nWhen they're trying to get a renewal, the other vendors know this is not going to be their business for too long. So that's when international pricing behavior happens. It's not when they execute early and deploy early. So actually, we're averting the last minute race to the bottom like you called it, by making sure our customers don't have to worry about the execution risk and trying to get renewals and trying to get best pricing in the last 6 months.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks, Gabriela. Next up is Fatima Boolani from Citi. And after that, Roger Boyd from UBS.\n\nFatima Aslam Boolani\n\nNikesh, on the platformization strategy. I was hoping you could drill into what the catalyst was for this to be a midyear change. What were you hearing from customers where you said we've got to pull the trigger in the middle of the year because it's admittedly atypical. And then as a related note, when you're rolling this out, if you've got customers who are not paying you for 6 months, how are salespeople going to get compensated for that free freemium sort of stance you're taking. So just how are you protecting I guess, the piece of the go-to-market organization as it relates to the new strategy?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThank you. Dipak did warn me this one will take a little bit of explaining. And -- so let me go back to what Saket said. For simplicity purposes, think about a ramp deal. So our salespeople still get paid on TCV, right? So they're still going to do a 3-year deal or a 5-year deal. We're not doing 6-month or 12-month deals. So you'll see that in our RPO. You'll still see us doing ramp deals where the first 6 months may not be charged, but the next 4.5 years is or the next 2.5 years is. So our salespeople will get paid on the TCV deals like they get paid today, right? That's not a problem. I think that's the best way to think about it and -- I'm sorry, there was another part that I missed, I apologize.\n\nFatima Aslam Boolani\n\nJust the impetus of it being a -- yes, what now?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI'd say the impetus, Fatima is fascinating. We are -- we've managed to double our business in the last 5 years. And for us to get to a double from here and more, we've had to step back and say, what did we do? We got 21 categories where we're best-in-breed to realize we're still fighting best-of-breed deals while we should be selling the platformization strategy and we realized selling the platformization strategy, which we have been for the last 6 months, as we said, we have been trialing this out, we've been running this play with about 6 months discovering, when we go in with the platform approach, we win more often than if we go into the best-of-breed only. Otherwise, we get whittled down on price, XDR to XDR or SASE to SASE. \r\nWhen you go with XSIAM with XDR, XSIAM and XSOAR, then we don't get a little down on price because customers see the TCO value and the ROI of doing the entire replacement together. But the moment we go up with that is like lots a lot of risk. I got to replace everything in the next 6 months. I'm not willing to commit, let's go one at a time. And they go one at a time, I get billed down on price with a legacy vendor.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks, Fatima. Next up, we have Roger Boyd, and after that, it will be Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\n\nRoger Foley Boyd\n\nGreat. Another follow-up on the platformization. But as you get more accommodative on some of these offerings, more aggressive on discounting. What are you expecting to see from a contract duration perspective? It sounds like the focus is going to be on RPO, but are you expecting to see contract duration actually extend in exchange for some of this economic and flexibility?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI think that's a great question. I think the way to think about it is that we still have 2 parts of our business. We'll still have the regular part of our business, which is still growing and competing best-of-breed. We expect that business to continue. Remember, this platformization really applies to where customers have the opportunity to consolidate and platformize. There are still many who are in different parts of their cybersecurity journey or the IT journey. So to the extent that we are dealing with the customer who's willing to consolidate with us, you will see contract durations go up because we're not going to do this if you're not going to get a commitment for a 3- to 5-year deal because it does not behoove us to do those deals if you don't see a long-term commitment to the customer because we are going to be consolidating multiple security products to them and working with them to implement them across the enterprise.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nNext question, Jonathan Ho from William Blair. And after that, we've got Adam Borg from Stifel.\n\nJonathan Frank Ho\n\nGreat. I guess one thing I'm trying to understand a little bit better is this ability to standardize on the platform, give you something similar to what Microsoft has done with their E5 bundling to sort of force customers or package very attractive terms for customers to switch. And I guess, how does that maybe play out in terms of customers' willingness to commit to a single vendor platform?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThat's a great question, Jonathan. Very apt question. Look, it allows us to do a much better job of putting stuff together across our portfolio as opposed to having to do each of these deals on an individualized basis. So you're bang on the idea that the consolidation benefits us and allows us to drive towards that platform much faster. That's helpful.\r\nI think it also gives us financial flexibility in terms of pricing deals. That's also very important, very true. But I'll give you an example, right, just this morning, I was on the phone and the customer is trying to buy an IoT capability. Independently, that IoT capability is going to cost them north of $5 million. They already have our firewalls. We allowed them to activate IoT off our firewalls, which cost us a lot less than $5 million. But that allowed them to consolidate. And now when the renewal comes up in 6 months or 12 months, they're going to be able to renew for a higher amount. So that degree of flexibility that we can offer our customers, but they don't have to go end up spending more and building yet another vector that they have to go consolidate in the future is what we're trying to drive to.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks, Adam. Next up is Keith Bachman from BMO followed by Tal Liani of BofA.\n\nKeith Frances Bachman\n\nYou confuse me, Walter. I think Dipak for you, you mentioned we certainly have the billings guide for Q3 and then implied for Q4, something like 10%. And you indicated that this was going to be a 12- to 18-month sort of impact as you try to anniversary consolidating spend. But is there any trough or any way to think about FY '25? I mean is it still double-digit billings growth that we should be thinking about? Or any kind of metrics on how you think about the 6 to -- or excuse me, 12 to 18-month impact where you're trying to anniversary the program?\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nYes, our aspiration is that towards the second half of '25, we should revert back to our original expectations of mid- to high double-digit growth. But as I said, so 12 to 18 is obviously we have to go experience these programs to see how they persist. But at some point in time, they will start to lap and give us better upside in the larger size deals that we're able to do.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI just want to make one more point, sorry, on this context. One of the things that I think should not be lost what Dipak has said. We have maintained our absolute free cash flow guidance for the year and absolute EPS cuts for the year. So we believe we can make all this happen whilst holding our earnings and free cash flow constant.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Next, we're going to go back to Adam Borg, and then we're going to go to Tal Liani for BofA.\n\nAdam Charles Borg\n\nAwesome. Maybe just on XSIAM, it was good to see the traction there. Maybe talk more about the displacement opportunity that you saw in the quarter. I think you talked about replacing -- displacing up to 19 different vendors since being introduced and talk more about how you plan to further penetrate that as far as this broader platformization approach.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nThanks, Adam. So Adam, we've displaced 19 unique different SIM vendors. And the reason that's relevant for us is that tells us that our platform has capability that spans multiple use cases and different types of products in the market. It's not like we only replace 1 kind of SIM. We have been able to replace different kinds of SIM, which offer different capabilities in our customers. And we still believe this is the fastest and best cybersecurity product that has been created. We are north of 65 customers now in 9 months. As we said, we have signed a larger number of deals this quarter. And on a deal per deal basis, we did $90 million in TCV.\r\nSo we're really excited about it. This does resonate with our customers. We are launching tomorrow an offer to replace end points for our customers who are stuck with legacy end points which is one of the things that holds us back in being able to deploy XSIAM.\r\nWe've also announced support of other non-legacy vendors that they have in their infrastructure. So our customers have been asking for that so we can support some of the other leading edge XDR capabilities in the market. So we are making a sordid play to be able to be the SOC of choice. It is radically different and better than most other SIMs out in the marketplace. So we are putting a concerted effort, very excited about where we are with it.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nThanks a lot, Adam. Next up, Tal Liani from BofA, followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank.\n\nTal Liani\n\nFirst, just clarification, you spoke about discounting or pricing. Is there any product where you see more discounting than others? Is it on the legacy firewall side? Or do we see it on SASE or Cortex? Or should we look at it as a complete kind of pricing for the platform?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI think the best analogy is Jonathan's analogy, which is the bundling of multiple things into 1 capability, more like I don't want to call it that 1. More like 1 of the other vendors has a certain bundling philosophy. I think it's more like that than it is about individual product categories because it's not about if you buy SASE, I'll make it cheap or if you buy XT, I will make it cheap. It's about if you commit to my network security platform, the combined whole of it will be much better TCO and ROI for you, and I'll take the execution risk.\r\nYou don't remember, the exit ARR for me is going to be no different than it is today and I think that's why I don't like the word discounting or reduced pricing. The exit ARR will be consistent with what I would get today. I would end up taking the execution risk away from the customer.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thank you, Tal. Next up, we have Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. And after that, Matt Hedberg from RBC.\n\nBrad Alan Zelnick\n\nGreat. I wanted to ask another question from a go-to-market perspective, just extending on Fatima's question. Nikesh, how do you align the channel to execute on this platformization strategy where for you to win, somebody else has to lose. And their economics are typically a function of present day billings, not LTV. And then also just extending on that, you've talked about the SIs as a real strategic opportunity for you. Where do they fit into this platform -- I got to practice the word, platformization strategy.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nI know it's a new word. Only introduced 5 years ago when you didn't believe us. But now we've got to worry about consolidation. Thank you, Brad. So when I start to make fun with you, I start forgetting your question. So look, the 2 of your SI channel question, so 2 parts of it. It's a great question.\r\nFirst of all, channel does get compensated on TCV. So I think part of what we said is our deals are 40 times when they use all 3 platforms compared to a single platform deal. Our deals are north of 20 times than used 2 platforms, right? Our top 10 customers spent 36% more with us than everybody else. And that's all a function of the deal size. As we do the platformization, the deal size is going to get bigger. The channel gets paid on TCV. So channel has a lot of incentive to help us drive this platformization. I think you hit a very important point around SIs. We have been working really hard over the last 6 months with our SI partners to help activate and we're actually trying to get in front of their engagements with customers as opposed to wait for the RFPs. We have very strong relationships with almost every SI out there. It's been a concerted effort. We've just hired Kristy Friedrichs who is the CEO of New Relic to drive our partnerships, the Chief Partnership Officer. So we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it. And we're positively enthused about the traction we're getting with the SI.\r\nTo think about it, the SIs are new to this business over the last 3 to 5 years. They used to have cybersecurity businesses, but they really doubled down and focused on it, you can take your favorite SI and they all have a very strong practice in cybersecurity. And they would much rather partner with 1 large player or a few large players in the entire gamut of 3,000 cybersecurity companies that are out there. So it fits their aspirations. It fits our aspirations, our getting ahead of it. So they are a critical part of this platformization approach because these platform offers actually spin out a lot more services revenue than individual best-of-breed offers.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks. Next up is Matt Hedberg from RBC followed by Joe Gallo from Jefferies.\n\nMatthew George Hedberg\n\nGreat. I think one of the important points, Nikesh, you made is, despite all these changes, free cash flow margins are unchanged for fiscal '24 and the midterm targets, I guess the question for Dipak, I just wanted to make sure I understood why that's the case. It sounds like you said it was prior arrangements and optimizing vendor payments. First of all, did I get that right? And I guess, secondly, when we get into '25, are there other variables that we think of that could potentially change that margin target or kind of confidence level that, that margin target can hold into next year?\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nSo whilst we're not guiding to next year, we're pretty confident in our free cash flow margin, as I said in my prepared remarks going forward. Just to be clear, the thing that buttresses our free cash flow margin the most is our operating margin. Okay? So we do expect that to continue to increase. And that's kind of like 1 part of it. We -- secondly, we've got more business that's coming off prior contracts that we've signed. So we have visibility to that. We know when they're going to come. We also have some incremental focus on factors that impact our cash flow, for example, vendor payment terms. But when we put that all together, look, we're pretty confident on the cash flow side.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Joe Gallo at Jefferies.\n\nJoseph Anthony Gallo\n\nI appreciate the candor in cash on spend and it's logical. But given your discounting comments, can you just give an update on the competitive environment on win rates or any metrics you're tracking, particularly in SASE. You have seen several vendors enter the market, several noting large 8-figure wins. You've certainly made 8-figure deals look easy over time, but what gives you confidence this is not competitive, and this is more of a short-term hiccup?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nFirst of all, I would not classify this as a short-term hiccup. I know you guys would love life that was linearly nice in quarters and moved up in a beat-and-raise percentage basis. I'm trying to get this done in the next 3 to 5 years where we become even a bigger and larger platform in cybersecurity.\r\nIf I step back and look at what we've done over the last 5 years, we established the notion of the platform in cybersecurity. It wasn't a notion that existed. I'm trying to accelerate the deployment of the notion because I believe competitive advantaging product in this industry the last 2 to 3 years. At this point in time, I believe we have the largest competitive advantage across our platforms in the market starting with our XSIAM product in our SOC space. We think that is a 15-year-old legacy space, which we should get quickly and go and deploy as quickly as we can across the board and take you any friction in the process.\r\nOn network security, we did not have network securities, Zero Trust offers in the marketplace. We are starting to see our customer bought $40 million of SASE and then came and replaced all their firewalls with us in the last 6 months, right? So we are seeing the customers show that behavior. We're trying to take all the friction out of the way, so they can make that happen.\r\nNow if I break it down into the 3 categories we're in, I think in network security, you'll see more and more zero trust offers where hardware, software and SASE have to combine. There's very few vendors in the space who can do that today. So they're trying to hold on to the legacy positions. We're accelerating combination across that category. You can make your own judgments as to which vendors are going to benefit, which ones are not going to benefit as much.\r\nIn the SOC space, there is only 1 option, deploy AI in your SOC. The average technology in the SOC space is 13 to 15 years old, right? That was not made for AI. It was not ready for AI, it doesn't matter who you buy, it doesn't matter what gets acquired. What is important is that you can actually have an AI delivered data lake that delivers the capability of XSIAM. On cloud, it's a new space. And we're beginning to see what's fascinating is for us, our best cloud customers are the ones who are delivering SaaS software to their customers. So we take the large platform players, they use our cloud security because they understand the need to have an integrated cloud platform. So we have green shoots. We have trialed this. This is the time for us to double down and accelerate. That's what we're doing. It's not a hiccup.\n\nWalter Pritchard\n\nGreat. Thanks, Joe, for that last question. With that, I'll pass it over to Nikesh for his closing remarks.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nNo, I know this was exciting for all of you guys, even more exciting for us. We are committed. We believe this is the right way forward. We believe this is the way we can deliver a faster platformization, a faster way to consolidate the industry into a platform. We hope that in the next 5 years, this allows us to double our business from here, which is why I'm here. I want to say thank you to all of our employees, all of our partners, and of course, all of you for taking the time to listen to our earnings call.",

Beyond our financial results, we achieved a number of notable milestones in Q2, worthy of spotlighting. We continued to drive large deals, including a steady stream of million dollar plus deals and success in our largest deals with 10 transactions that were $20 million in the quarter. Our 10 highest spending customers in Q2 increased their spend with us by 36% of the period. I also wanted to update you on key achievements across our three platforms. In our network security business, we continue to see progress driving ARR growth in our SASE business. Q2 was our fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth.\n\nSee also 16 Companies With The Highest Sustainable Revenue in the US and 25 Most Affordable Places to Retire in the U.S. in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc. tumbled in late trading after cutting its revenue forecast for the year, sparking concerns that customers are reining in tech spending.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Stocks Fall Before Nvidia\u2019s Make-or-Break Moment: Markets Wrap Amazon Deserves to Be Called Out for Swindling Users\n\nSales will be $7.95 billion to $8 billion this fiscal year, the company said in a statement Tuesday. It previously projected revenue of as much as $8.2 billion, and analysts were estimating $8.18 billion.\n\nThe outlook suggests that customers may be dialing back their spending ambitions, even as online attacks proliferate. The top end of Palo Alto Networks\u2019 sales forecast represents an increase of 16%, well below its 25%-plus growth rate of recent years.\n\nThe company did maintain its outlook for earnings and free cash flow for fiscal 2024, which Chief Financial Officer Dipak Golechha said reflected \u201cdisciplined execution on profitable growth.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer Nikesh Arora echoed those remarks on a conference call, telling analysts that the company has been successfully executing its profitable growth strategy. But he also said customers were facing \u201cspending fatigue\u201d in cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cThis is new,\u201d he said. Customers are finding that adding incremental products \u201cis not necessarily driving a better security outcome for them.\u201d\n\nThe stock fell as much as 15% in extended trading following the earnings report. And the news weighed on shares of other cybersecurity companies, including Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. and Zscaler Inc.\n\nPalo Alto Networks shares had climbed 24% this year on the hope that cyber investments would continue to surge. It has outperformed most tech stocks in 2024, alongside security peers like Crowdstrike.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company posted sales of $1.98 billion in the second quarter, which ended Jan. 31, up 19% from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated $1.97 billion. Product revenue grew more slowly than service and support sales, underscoring an ongoing shift at the company. Excluding some items, earnings amounted to $1.46 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 billings \u2014 a closely watched measure \u2014 will range as high as $10.2 billion this year, the company said.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks's (NASDAQ:PANW) Q2 Earnings Results: Revenue In Line With Expectations But Stock Drops 12.9%\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q2 FY2024, with revenue up 19.3% year on year to $1.98 billion.\n\nIs now the time to buy Palo Alto Networks? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q2 FY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $1.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.97 billion (small beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $1.46 vs analyst estimates of $1.30 (12.2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q3 2024 is $1.97 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $2.04 billion (billings guidance for the period also missed expectations) The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year from $8.18 billion to $7.98 billion at the midpoint, a 2.4% decrease (billings guidance for the period also missed expectations) Gross Margin (GAAP): 74.7%, up from 71.8% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $115.5 billion\n\n\"Our leadership across all of our three platforms and growing cross-platform adoption puts us in a strong and unique position,\" said Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.\n\nFounded in 2005 by cybersecurity engineer Nir Zuk, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) makes hardware and software cybersecurity products that protect companies from cyberattacks, breaches, and malware threats.\n\nNetwork Security\n\nAlmost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks. The migration of businesses to the cloud and employees working remotely in insecure environments is increasing demand modern cloud-based network security software, which offers better performance at lower cost than maintaining the traditional on-premise solutions, such as expensive specialized firewall hardware.\n\nSales Growth\n\nAs you can see below, Palo Alto Networks's revenue growth has been strong over the last two years, growing from $1.32 billion in Q2 FY2022 to $1.98 billion this quarter.\n\nStory continues Palo Alto Networks Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Palo Alto Networks's quarterly revenue was once again up 19.3% year on year. On top of that, its revenue increased $97 million quarter on quarter, a strong improvement from the $75.2 million decrease in Q1 2024. This is a sign of acceleration of growth and very nice to see indeed.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 18% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nProfitability\n\nWhat makes the software as a service business so attractive is that once the software is developed, it typically shouldn't cost much to provide it as an ongoing service to customers. Palo Alto Networks's gross profit margin, an important metric measuring how much money there's left after paying for servers, licenses, technical support, and other necessary running expenses, was 74.7% in Q2. Palo Alto Networks Gross Margin (GAAP)\n\nThat means that for every $1 in revenue the company had $0.75 left to spend on developing new products, sales and marketing, and general administrative overhead. Trending up over the last year, Palo Alto Networks's gross margin is around the average of a typical SaaS businesses. Gross margin has a major impact on a company\u2019s ability to develop new products and invest in marketing, which may ultimately determine the winner in a competitive market. This makes it a critical metric to track for the long-term investor.\n\nKey Takeaways from Palo Alto Networks's Q2 Results\n\nThe quarter itself was ok, with revenue beat by a bit and operating income beating by a more convincing amount. However, both full-year billings and full-year revenue guidance were below expectations. EPS guidance for that period was more in line. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well. Overall, this was an ok quarter for Palo Alto Networks with the poor guidance dragging shares down. The company is down 13% on the results and currently trades at $318.55 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Palo Alto Networks right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

There are a significant number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from statements made in this press release, including: developments and changes in general market, political, economic, and business conditions; risks associated with managing our growth; risks associated with new products and subscription and support offerings; shifts in priorities or delays in the development or release of new offerings, or the failure to timely develop and achieve market acceptance of new products and subscriptions as well as existing products and subscription and support offerings; failure of our business strategies; rapidly evolving technological developments in the market for security products and subscription and support offerings; our customers' purchasing decisions and the length of sales cycles; our competition; our ability to attract and retain new customers; our ability to acquire and integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner; our debt repayment obligations; and our share repurchase program, which may not be fully consummated or enhance shareholder value, and any share repurchases which could affect the price of our common stock.\n\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023, which is available on our website at investors.paloaltonetworks.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics Palo Alto Networks has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The company uses these non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are helpful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing the company's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures or key metrics.\n\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the company's historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin. Palo Alto Networks defines non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by total revenue. The company defines non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, and restructuring and other costs. The company believes that non-GAAP operating margin provides management and investors with greater visibility into the underlying performance of the company's core business operating results.\n\nNon-GAAP net income and net income per share, diluted. Palo Alto Networks defines non-GAAP net income as net income plus share-based compensation-related charges, including share-based payroll tax expense, acquisition-related costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related charges, including legal settlements, restructuring and other costs, and non-cash charges related to convertible notes. The company also excludes from non-GAAP net income foreign currency gains (losses) and tax adjustments related to our long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate in order to provide a complete picture of the company's recurring core business operating results. The company defines non-GAAP net income per share, diluted, as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding, which includes the potentially dilutive effect of the company's employee equity incentive plan awards and the company's convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants, after giving effect to the anti-dilutive impact of the company's note hedge agreements, which reduces the potential economic dilution that otherwise would occur upon conversion of the company's convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, the anti-dilutive impact of the note hedge is not reflected in diluted shares outstanding. The company considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that it uses non-GAAP operating margin.\n\nBillings. Palo Alto Networks defines billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. The company considers billings to be a key metric used by management to manage the company's business and believes billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of the company's business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The company considers billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if sales of subscriptions continue to increase and the company experiences strong renewal rates for subscriptions and support.\n\nInvestors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics as analytical tools. In particular, the billings metric reported by the company includes amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Additionally, many of the adjustments to the company's GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in the company's financial results for the foreseeable future, such as share-based compensation, which is an important part of Palo Alto Networks employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that Palo Alto Networks excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Palo Alto Networks compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. In the future, the company may also exclude non-recurring expenses and other expenses that do not reflect the company's core business operating results.\n\nAbout Palo Alto Networks Palo Alto Networks is the world's cybersecurity leader.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Fomento Econ\u00f3mico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. FMX, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, Shopify Inc. SHOP, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for FMX, Palo Alto Networks and Shopify\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Fomento Econ\u00f3mico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V., Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Shopify Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of FMX have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+52.9% vs. +9.1%). The company\u2019s bottom-line improved year over year on robust sales growth, improved gross margin and lower interest expense.\r\n\r\nRevenues improved on gains across all business units resulting from effective growth strategies and robust demand across markets. The company\u2019s digital initiatives and business expansion endeavors have also been aiding results. Its efforts to expand in the U.S. specialized distribution segment bodes well.\r\n\r\nHowever, FEMSA witnessed operating margin decline due to contraction at Proximity Americas, Health, and Fuel divisions due to higher labor expenses related to the labor reforms in Mexico and the inclusion of Proximity Europe.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on FMX here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+76.8% vs. +46.5%). The company is benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Shopify have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+92.6% vs. +52.5%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in the merchant base. In 2023, 35% more merchants from outside North America launched and grew their businesses on Shopify\u2019s platform compared with 2022, reflecting growing international penetration.\r\n\r\nIt has been focused on winning merchants regularly based on a unified commerce platform and new merchant-friendly applications like Bill Pay, Tax Platform, Collective and the Marketplace Connect app. Strong adoption of these solutions holds promise.\r\n\r\nIntegration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. An expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Snap, Pinterest and Criteo is expected to expand its merchant base. However, raging inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.t\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy to Beat the Market This Week",
        "content": "During the week of February 12-16, we talked about three stocks to watch, Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB), to gain insights into broader market trends and potentially benefit. As the earnings season peaks, we explore three stocks to buy this week, and we explain the reasons behind it.\n\nThe relatively heavy economic data published last week, including the U.S. CPI and Retail Sales figures, has added market volatility. It also seemed that the U.S. economy would avoid a recession, a positive catalyst for those looking for stocks to buy this week. Both events bolstered investor sentiment despite rising bond yields.\r\n\r\nLast week also caught the market somewhat broadening out beyond its largest constituents. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained strong momentum, implying overall optimism. This provided another sign for those risk-on investors looking for stocks to buy in the small-cap space.\r\n\r\nThe February 19 \u2013 23 earnings calendar may be fairly light, leaving direction in the hands of the remainder of corporate earnings reports. A primary focus for those scouting stocks to buy will be tech giant Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) widely anticipated earnings release. Investors may secure some of their profits ahead or post-announcement, inducing downward pressure on its stock price. However, a solid quarterly report would probably help lift the broader market.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Nvidia, where earnings could prompt upward or downward momentum, a few other stocks to buy could present interesting opportunities. Solid earnings may help offset potential increased volatility should the last of the Magnificent 7 fail to catalyze further upside across markets.\u200b\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), the prominent coffee company, could be one of the stocks to buy this week. The company presents an interesting investment opportunity during a week anticipated to focus substantially on tech news. Despite the company\u2019s earnings results at the beginning of February missing analyst estimates, investors initially helped push the stock price higher. Yet, during the subsequent period following the release, its stock price declined below the level it stood at during the announcement. However, SBUX\u2019s retracement has not coincided with any adjustment to its underlying fundamentals.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company reported increased profits of 20% year-on-year (YOY) and maintained a generous dividend policy. This suggests its stock price may stabilise as investors refocus beyond the immediate post-earnings reaction.\r\n\r\nStarbucks currently trades on a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.9x, below the 27.2x of the S&P 500 Index. Analysts have established an average price target of $107.15, representing a 15% potential upside.\u200b\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) stocks to buy, Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) could be one of the more intriguing opportunities this week as optimism in the tech sector remains buoyant. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly results after the close of trading on Tuesday. Its stock price has risen in anticipation of the earnings release, and if the optimism continues, it could still be one of the stocks to buy not just for this week but also the following.\r\n\r\nDespite the bottom line growing some 66% in the previous quarter, the market reacted negatively to disappointing forward revenue guidance. Therefore, guidance will likely be a key focus this time around. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 24% to $1.30, with revenues increasing 19% to $1.97 billion. Notably, Palo Alto has a track record of exceeding analyst estimates by an average of 20% or more.\n\nLennar (LEN) Lennar (LEN) website homepage. Lennar logo visible on the phone screen\n\nSource: madamF via Shutterstock\n\nHomebuilder Lennar (NYSE:LEN) could be the last of the stocks to buy this week after seeing its share price drop in the wake of the CPI data released last week. It suggested that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may maintain higher interest rates and, therefore, mortgage prices would increase. However, with easing yields, its stock price could stage a rebound.\n\nAn even bigger catalyst for the construction company may be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) upcoming earnings report at the end of the week. This is because Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, has been accumulating homebuilder stock lately, including a $21.4 million stake in Lennar. While a small portion of his overall investment portfolio, the renowned investor\u2019s interest in the company implies it may have growth potential as the U.S. continues grappling with a sizable housing deficit of 3.1 million units.\r\n\r\nLennar currently trades at a P/E ratio of just 10.9x while holding a $6.3 billion cash reserve to invest in new opportunities. The company increased its cash holdings by $1.7 billion since last year, which makes it an even more compelling stock to buy this week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A key focus for investors will be how well Nvidia Corp. can keep capturing the growth for artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLargest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Amazon Deserves to Be Called Out for Swindling Users Stocks Pause Near Record as Traders Await Catalyst: Markets Wrap Wall Street\u2019s Moelis Bet Big on the Middle East. Now He\u2019s Cashing In\n\nThe tech darling \u2014 its market value reached $1.8 trillion this week \u2014 will have to show investors whether its performance is consistent with their \u201chigh expectations,\u201d said Jennifer Foster, co-chief investment officer at Chilton Investment Company.\n\nCompanies\u2019 willingness to invest in cybersecurity and software will also be a concern among Palo Alto Networks Inc., Synopsys Inc., and Intuit Inc. shareholders.\n\nCost-cutting measures will remain a dominant theme for US companies this week, following a slew of recent job cuts. While the US economy has shown resilience so far, some executives have urged caution about the business environment this year.\n\n\u201cThe economy is strong but slowing,\u201d said Grace Lee, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle.\n\nMonday: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday: Walmart\u2019s (WMT US) adjusted EPS is slated to fall 3.5%, the first decline in more than a year, on higher labor and product costs, BI said. The company is boosting compensation to retain store managers, while shoppers shift to lower-margin consumable and health items. Walmart may discuss a WSJ report that it\u2019s in talks to buy consumer-electronics maker Vizio Holding Corp. for more than $2 billion.\n\nDiamondback\u2019s (FANG US) $26 billion takeover of Endeavor and how it will affect future earnings, as well as bolster dividends and buybacks, will be the focus when the shale driller reports. The deal may dilute Diamondback\u2019s 2025 EPS by 2%, BMO said. Palo Alto Networks (PANW US) could modestly beat expectations and reaffirm its outlook after its clients issued strong results, Stifel said. Annualized recurring revenue probably grew 47% in the fiscal second quarter, compared with a 63% jump a year earlier. Home Depot\u2019s (HD US) same-store sales probably fell 3.6%, though declines shouldn\u2019t be as steep in subsequent quarters. The home improvement store is trying to expand market share among professional customers \u2014 a key driver of higher comparable store sales \u2014 by targeting complex projects, BI said.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday: Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA US) revenue is expected to more than triple for a second straight quarter, buoyed by soaring demand in its data center business, which accounts for 80% of the chipmaker\u2019s sales. AI demand remains strong, especially with Meta and Tesla continuing to load up on graphics processing units, Susquehanna said.\n\nAnalog Devices\u2019 (ADI US) first-quarter sales are projected to fall 23%, a third consecutive drop, amid weak demand in all the sectors it makes chips for. Peer Texas Instruments\u2019 soft outlook and revenue contraction may be an indicator for Analog Devices. Synopsys (SNPS US) \u2014 closing in on a $34 billion deal to buy Ansys \u2014 should post healthy sales growth, BI said, as its customers ramp up R&D and AI spending. Rivian\u2019s (RIVN US) vehicle deliveries fell short of analysts expectations, highlighting the automaker\u2019s challenges amid supply-chain issues and lower electric vehicle demand. Lucid\u2019s (LCID US) quarterly deliveries beat estimates. That meant it reached an annual target of 8,000 to 8,500 unit, though that was cut twice during 2023 from an original 14,000 forecast as it struggled to bounce back from supply issues and inconsistent output at the Arizona plant. Trip.com (TCOM US) probably tripled its adjusted earnings per share, jumping to 2.34 yuan (33 US cents), as demand for travel in China exceeds pre-pandemic levels, BI said. A doubling in revenue will have helped offset higher sales and marketing expenses. Etsy\u2019s (ETSY US) gross merchandise sales are set to fall 1.5% as holiday shopping only partly offset weak consumer spending, BI said. Temu\u2019s push into US markets might increase Etsy\u2019s customer-acquisition costs, Jefferies analyst said.\n\nThursday: Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s (KDP US) adjusted EPS is seen rising 8.2%, as US sales of its refreshment beverages grows on higher prices and volume, though sales of US coffee probably fell. Moderating input and operating costs will improve margins, BI said.\n\nBlock\u2019s (SQ US) Bitcoin revenue probably grew 33% last quarter, after shrinking a year earlier. Still, its initial 2024 gross profit outlook will probably miss expectations if it underperformed, Jefferies said. Weaker demand for food delivery and mobility will take Grab (GRAB US) results lower than previously expected, Barclays said. Watch for comments on revived merger talks with GoTo Group. Moderna (MRNA US) reported preliminary Covid-19 vaccine revenue of $6.1 billion for 2023, ahead of its outlook. Overall 2024 sales, including contribution from its RSV vaccine, will shrink to around $4 billion this year before growing in 2025, TD Cowen said. Carvana\u2019s (CVNA US) used vehicle revenue entered its sixth consecutive quarter of contraction as profitability and sustainability of virtual pre-owned vehicle sales remain a concern, BI said. Intuit (INTU US) may miss on consumer group sales as $60 million to $65 million of revenue shifts to the fiscal third quarter following a delayed start in the US Internal Revenue Service\u2019s tax filing season, Mizuho said. Booking Holdings\u2019 (BKNG US) revenue is projected to rise 17%. The company benefited from demand in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region where hotel spending remained resilient, Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFriday: Warner Bros Discovery\u2019s (WBD US) adjusted Ebitda probably rose 7.7%, consensus shows. Its licensing-first strategy \u2014 streaming shows like Young Sheldon on Netflix \u2014 boosted profitability, BI said. The company might detail its plans to launch a sports streaming service with Fox and Disney, which comes as its TV ad revenue is expected to continue falling.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today\u2019s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear What\u2019s Really Behind Tesla\u2019s Slowdown \u2018Playing God\u2019: This Labor Activist\u2019s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "US markets are closed today for the Presidents Day holiday. However, investors will soon be treated to the quarterly earnings reports from the likes of AI leader Nvidia and retail powerhouse Walmart, which will be the focus as the December reporting season comes to a conclusion.\n\nTuesday 20th February: How did Walmart Fair Through the Holiday Season?\n\nWalmart Inc. is anticipated to report increased sales for the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2024 year, but experts predict lower profits and lower earnings per share from the holiday period.\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 report, the company is anticipated by Wall Street to show revenue of around $170.2 billion, a 6% YoY increase. Operational income is expected to grow 12% YoY for a rise of $6.761 billion, and the EPS is forecast to be $1.65, an 8% YoY rise.\n\nWalmart\u2019s stock has been trading at record highs this month, at over $170 per share. The company announced in January that it will divide its shares three to one in order to lower the price and make them more affordable for staff members.\n\nWalmart reported a number of solid quarters in 2023, helped by increased sales of basic goods like food and fuel. Although recent credit card statistics looked encouraging for the store, Walmart\u2019s recent gains will likely be slowed by reduced food costs and a downturn in general merchandise sales. Investors will be keenly observing Walmart\u2019s comments about the current status of consumer spending.\n\nWalmart\u2019s shares are up more than 6.90% since the beginning of the year. Daily Walmart Chart \u2013 Source: ActivTrader\n\nTuesday 20th February: Will Home Depot Confound Expectations of a Disappointing Quarter?\n\nWhen Home Depot Inc. releases its most recent earnings report before the markets open on Tuesday, it is expected to reveal a decrease in both profit and revenue, weighed down by reduced sales volumes as consumers prioritize their spending.\n\nLast quarter, the company reported profits that were higher than expected, even though the company\u2019s sales were down for the period. The company revised its full-year sales projections down by 3% to 4% due to weaker customer demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research reports that the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $2.76, based on predictions from 15 analysts. The EPS for the same quarter in the previous year was $3.3.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s shares are up more than 5% since the beginning of the year. Daily Home Depot Chart \u2013 Source: ActivTrader\n\nTuesday 20th February: Palo Alto Networks Looks Set For Strong Results\n\nBased on projections from 14 analysts, Zacks Investment Research reports that the average EPS estimate for Palo Alto for the quarter will be around $0.58, up from $0.34 in the same quarter last year. The company anticipates sales for the second quarter of its fiscal year in the range of $1.955\u20131.985 billion, indicating an 18\u201320% rise in revenue from the previous year.\n\nStrong momentum from transaction wins is likely what will have helped Palo Alto\u2019s second-quarter results and boosted its top line. The robust demand for form factor hardware products\u2014especially models driven by machine learning that provide enterprises zero-trust network security\u2014is anticipated to have had a role in the quarter\u2019s success.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u2019 shares are up more than 26.80% since the beginning of the year. Daily Palo Alto Networks Chart \u2013 Source: ActivTrader\n\nWednesday 21st February: All Eyes on Nvidia\n\nAs the leading manufacturer of chips for artificial intelligence worldwide waits to report its earnings this Wednesday, investors are watching for a huge bump in the share price if the results are as promising as expected.\n\nSince January 1, Nvidia\u2019s stock has increased by more than 46% due to excitement about AI\u2019s potential for business. The $570 billion gain in market capitalization more than triples Intel\u2019s market worth. Shares of Nvidia, whose processors are regarded as the gold standard in the AI business, increased by over 240% in 2023. The company last week also surpassed Alphabet, the parent firm of Google, to take the third spot as the most valuable US company.\n\nThe consensus expectation from 33 analysts is that Nvidia will report profits of $4.56 per share and an increase in quarterly sales to $20.378 billion from $6.05 billion a year earlier.\n\nNvidia\u2019s shares are up more than 50.70% since the beginning of the year. Daily Nvidia Chart \u2013 Source: ActivTrader\n\nThursday 22nd February: Can Intuit Corp continue its steady growth on the back of AI?\n\nThe provider of tax and accounting software is expected to report its earnings on Thursday after the market closes.\n\nLast quarter revenues were $2.98 billion, up 15% over the previous year, whereby the top line supposedly benefited from significant increase in the Small Business and Self-employed division. The CEO at the time attributed its accelerated innovation across the global platform to a strategy involving greater use of AI and data.\n\nIntuit is expected to announce profits of $2.29 per share, representing a 4.09% increase over the prior year, and sales of $3.39 billion, representing an 11.36% increase over the same period last year.\n\nIntuit Corp\u2019s shares are up more than 8.60% since the beginning of the year. Daily Intuit Corp Chart \u2013 Source: ActivTrader\n\nThursday 22nd February: Can Nestle still compete after price hikes?\n\nThe Swiss global food and beverage manufacturing company is scheduled to disclose financial results on Thursday before the bell.\n\nLate last year, the company reported lower-than-expected nine-month sales growth as increased product costs put buyers off, causing shares to fall, but the company expects volumes to turn positive again by the end of this year. At which point, the company confirmed their full-year 2023 projection of organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and an underlying trading operating profit margin of 17.0% to 17.5%. They also suggested that Earnings per share in constant currency were predicted to climb by 6%-10%.\n\nEarnings per share are expected to come in at 5.76, representing growth of 11.8% year over year, and a revenue estimate of $27.90 billion, up from $25.25 billion last quarter.\n\nNestle\u2019s shares are down more than 2.15% since the beginning of the year.

        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) Reports Earnings Tomorrow. What To Expect\n\nCybersecurity provider Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) will be reporting earnings tomorrow afternoon. Here's what to expect.\n\nLast quarter Palo Alto Networks reported revenues of $1.88 billion, up 20.1% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 1.9%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with\u00a0full-year revenue guidance missing analysts'\u00a0estimates. On the other hand,\u00a0revenue and EPS beat expectations this quarter, driven by better-than-expected ARR (annual recurring revenue)\u00a0and cRPO (calculated remaining performance obligations).\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Palo Alto Networks's revenue to grow 19.1% year on year to $1.97 billion, slowing down from the 25.7% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.30 per share. Palo Alto Networks Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company only missed Wall St's revenue estimates once over the last two years, and has on average exceeded top line expectations by 1%.\n\nLooking at Palo Alto Networks's peers in the cybersecurity segment, some of them have already reported Q2 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect.

        "content": "With artificial intelligence becoming increasingly ingrained in our daily lives, can the innovation pick out the best cybersecurity stocks for robust returns? I\u2019m eager to find out!\n\nHeading over to ChatGPT, I asked the digital intelligence platform to provide me with cybersecurity stocks that have \u201cserious upside potential,\u201d mentioning the 10X target. Given the limitations for AI stock predictions, I wasn\u2019t caught off guard with its suggestions. If anything, I was a bit bored.\n\nNevertheless, I simply wanted an answer to my inquiry without attempting to shake it down until I heard something I wanted to hear; otherwise, what would be the point? With that in mind, let\u2019s explore AI\u2019s top choices for cybersecurity stocks with serious upside potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading provider of cloud-native endpoint security solutions. Further, its platform offers advanced threat protection, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and threat intelligence services to enterprises and organizations worldwide. Due to the rising frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, CrowdStrike\u2019s innovative approach could position CRWD stock for long-term growth.\n\nPressing the intelligent chatbot for more information, it stated that CrowdStrike enjoys a strong growth trajectory. Since its inception, it has consistently posted strong financial metrics and has expanded its market share. Looking at the numbers myself, it\u2019s definitely onto something. Right now, CrowdStrike prints a 43.5% three-year revenue growth rate. That\u2019s much better than most other cybersecurity stocks.\n\nNow, the challenge that clouds CRWD is that while analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy, the average price target sits at $300.42. From the time of writing, the estimate implies a loss of more than 9%. That\u2019s not surprising given the 90.2X forward earnings multiple.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the high-side price target lands at $375, implying over 13% upside. If by 10X returns you meant 1.10X, CRWD is your investment. Still, as a long-term idea, it\u2019s not bad for AI stock predictions.\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nI don\u2019t fault ChatGPT for this idea one bit because how it could possibly know? But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily shower Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) as a 10X opportunity. Why? Since the beginning of the year, ZS already gained over 19% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s up over 90% or nearly double. That\u2019s not a great recipe for buying low and selling high.\n\nStill, ChatGPT remarks that it could be one of the top cybersecurity stocks due to its cloud security mechanisms. Per the chatbot, the company\u2019s platform features a zero-trust security architecture. Via Zscaler\u2019s website, zero trust represents a protocol that no entity should be trusted by default. Such a standard should prevent the weakest link from imposing vulnerabilities on the entire chain.\n\nLooking at this particular context, the narrative becomes clear. With more businesses adopting cloud-based technologies, it\u2019s vital to shore up any vulnerabilities. As well, remote work protocols could represent a nightmare for organizational security.\n\nAnalysts rate shares a strong buy. However, the average price target sits at $244.27, implying almost 4% downside from where I am. In fairness, though, the high-side target is $311, implying 23% upside. Again, that\u2019s decent for AI stock predictions.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be quite blunt, I was nervous that ChatGPT would select Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). It wasn\u2019t to the level of Milli Vanilli winning a Grammy or anything like that. Still, PANW stock carries the same disadvantage that Zscaler does, just worse. On a year-to-date basis, Palo Alto shares gained just under 27%. In the trailing year, the enterprise returned shareholders over 113%.\n\nSo, can the fire keep burning? It\u2019s unfair to put this on ChatGPT. However, from a longer-term framework, Palo Alto\u2019s comprehensive suite of cybersecurity solutions \u2013 including firewall, cloud security, endpoint protection and threat intelligence services \u2013 should help spark gradual upside interest. Let\u2019s face it, nefarious actors won\u2019t ever stop their activities. The only way cyberthreats cease is if the internet fails altogether. We don\u2019t want that.\n\nIn that sense, PANW and the other top-tier ideas are permanently relevant cybersecurity stocks. As you might imagine, analysts also rate shares a strong buy. However, the average price target of $356.63 basically calls for 3% downside risk. However, the most optimistic target aims for $450, which would be about 23% up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "With 85% ownership, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) boasts of strong institutional backing",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Palo Alto Networks' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Palo Alto Networks, beginning with the chart below.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Palo Alto Networks?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Palo Alto Networks. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Palo Alto Networks' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nStory continues earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Palo Alto Networks is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.7%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.8% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.\n\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\n\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Palo Alto Networks\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nWe can see that insiders own shares in Palo Alto Networks, Inc.. Insiders own US$1.3b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Palo Alto Networks. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Palo Alto Networks has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Fomento Econ\u00f3mico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX), Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) and Shopify Inc. (SHOP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of FMX have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+52.9% vs. +9.1%). The company\u2019s bottom-line improved year over year on robust sales growth, improved gross margin and lower interest expense.\r\n\r\nRevenues improved on gains across all business units resulting from effective growth strategies and robust demand across markets. The company\u2019s digital initiatives and business expansion endeavors have also been aiding results. Its efforts to expand in the U.S. specialized distribution segment bodes well.\r\n\r\nHowever, FEMSA witnessed operating margin decline due to contraction at Proximity Americas, Health, and Fuel divisions due to higher labor expenses related to the labor reforms in Mexico and the inclusion of Proximity Europe.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on FMX here >>>)\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past six months (+76.8% vs. +46.5%). The company is benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-generation security platforms, attributable to the rise in the hybrid work environment and the heightened need for stronger security.\r\n\r\nPANW\u2019s strong back-to-back quarterly performances reflect its sustained focus on product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy. The normalization of the supply chain is also aiding growth across the Products, Services and Subscription segments.\r\n\r\nHowever, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds might hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability. Also, high acquisition-related expenses are denting margins.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto Networks here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Shopify have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+92.6% vs. +52.5%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in the merchant base. In 2023, 35% more merchants from outside North America launched and grew their businesses on Shopify\u2019s platform compared with 2022, reflecting growing international penetration.\r\n\r\nIt has been focused on winning merchants regularly based on a unified commerce platform and new merchant-friendly applications like Bill Pay, Tax Platform, Collective and the Marketplace Connect app. Strong adoption of these solutions holds promise.\r\n\r\nIntegration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. An expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Snap, Pinterest and Criteo is expected to expand its merchant base. However, raging inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.t\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

(7:10) - How To Use Fibonacci To Become A Better Investor (13:30) - Navigating A Chart That Has Gone Parabolic (24:45) - Using The Fibonacci Sequence During A Stock Pull Back? (35:40) - Episode Roundup: SMCI, PANW, NOW, SNAP, \u00a0PYPL, PATH Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist and the Editor of Zacks Counterstrike and the Commodity Innovators portfolios, Jeremy Mullin, to talk about what Fibonacci levels are and how to use them to do better stock trades.\n\nWhat is a Fibonacci Level?\n\nFibonacci retracement levels are named after a medieval mathematician, Leonardo de Pisa, who later became known as Fibonacci. Some regard him as a math genius and the man who brought the Hindu/Arab numbering system to Europe.\n\nFibonacci retracement levels are a strategy that some traders use to analyze a stock's resistance levels. You can use many different retracement levels but one of the most common is 61.8%.\n\nHow do you use Fibonacci Levels?\n\nA lot of this podcast is looking at the charts on 5 popular stocks. Jeremy draws Fibonacci levels for each and discusses what he sees as retracement levels.\n\nTo get the most out of this podcast, please watch the video podcast to be able to see the charts, although Jeremy does an excellent job at explaining it for those only able to listen in on the audio podcast.\n\nStory continues\n\n5 Popular Stocks and Their Fibonacci Levels\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been the hottest stock on Wall Street over the last year. Yes, it's hotter than NVIDIA. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up 779% over the last year with some saying it has gone \"vertical\" in 2024.\n\nTracey recently bought shares of Super Micro Computer for the Insider Trader portfolio when an insider bought after the recent earnings report. She has taken some profit off the table this week.\n\nWhat does the Fibonacci levels tell us about Super Micro Computer's extraordinary rally?\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a red-hot stock in 2024, with the shares hitting new highs. It's up 125% over the last year and 387% over the last 5 years.\n\nBut is Palo Alto Networks now too hot to handle? It's up 13% in the last month alone.\n\nAre the Fibonacci levels signaling it may be time to short Palo Alto Networks? Or does the rally have more legs?\n\n3. ServiceNow, Inc. NOW\n\nServiceNow has been a winning stock for years, with shares up 229% over the last 5 years. That easily beats the S&P 500's return of 78%. Shares of ServiceNow have also gained big in the last year, adding 68.8%.\n\nWhat signals are the Fibonacci levels sending traders on ServiceNow today?\n\n4. Snap Inc. SNAP\n\nSnap shares plunged recently after a disappointing earnings report, falling 32.2% over the last month. Over the last year, shares of Snap have moved in a narrow trading range and were up, but just 4.6%.\n\nIt's not as easy to deploy the Fibonacci levels on stocks with less volatility and narrow trading ranges but Jeremy shows examples of where the Fib levels would be.\n\nShould traders avoid stocks like Snap that have broken down?\n\n5. PayPal Holdings, Inc. PYPL\n\nPayPal Holdings has fallen 27.9% over the last year. It's also down 4.5% over the last month.\n\nAnalysts have been cutting their 2024 earnings estimates over the last week. PayPal is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nEven as PayPal shares sink, do the Fibonacci levels indicate more pain may be coming?\n\nWhat Else Do You Need to Know About Fibonacci Levels?\n\nTune into this week's podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of SMCI in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\n\nJoin us on Facebook:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\n\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com/performance\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Palo Alto (PANW) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks PANW is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 2.\n\nPalo Alto projects its fiscal second-quarter revenues in the range of $1.955-$1.985 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 18-20%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.97 billion, implying growth of 19.1% from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nFor the fiscal second quarter, the company expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.29-$1.31 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PANW\u2019s non-GAAP earnings is pegged at $1.30 per share, indicating an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $1.05.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 22.2%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPalo Alto Networks, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Quote\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the strong momentum stemming from deal wins, which is expected to have boosted its top line. The strong demand for form factor hardware products, particularly machine learning-powered models that ensure zero-trust network security for organizations, is expected to have contributed to the quarterly performance.\n\nThe growing and accelerated migration to the cloud in a post-pandemic era is likely to have boosted the adoption of the aforementioned platforms. The company projects year-over-year billings growth between 15% and 18% ($2.335-$2.385 billion) in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nMoreover, the increased use of the cloud and remote networks in a hybrid working environment has resulted in escalating cyberattacks. This is leading to a rise in the demand for cybersecurity solutions. PANW\u2019s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from this demand surge.\n\nPalo Alto has been gaining from the Bridgecrew acquisition, which forms the crux of the Prisma public cloud and Xpanse, which encompasses the basis of Cortex. Prisma and Cortex are likely to have continued performing well in the fiscal second quarter as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) recognitions are boosting the adoption of Palo Alto\u2019s products by government organizations. The company\u2019s Prisma Access, Cortex XDR, Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and WildFire received FedRAMP recognitions.\n\nThis FedRAMP recognition reflects the U.S. public sector\u2019s trust in PANW\u2019s IoT security solutions. This is anticipated to have encouraged the adoption of its products during the period in discussion.\n\nHigher software mix, normalization in the supply-chain environment and efficiencies in customer support are anticipated to have aided the gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, better cost management is expected to have driven the second-quarter bottom line.\n\nWhat Our Model Says\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Palo Alto this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that\u2019s not the case here.\n\nThough PANW currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nStocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nPer our model, NVIDIA NVDA, AutoZone AZO and Booking Holdings BKNG have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.\n\nNVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +5.26%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 21. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.51 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 412.5%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $20.18 billion, calling for a year-over-year rise of 233.5%.\n\nAutoZone is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb 27. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +3.83% at present. AutoZone\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.9%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $26.18 per share, suggesting an increase of 6.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s earnings of $24.64. AutoZone\u2019s quarterly revenues are estimated to improve 4.4% to $3.85 billion.\n\nBooking Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.07%. The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 22. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 16.4%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth-quarter earnings stands at $26.69 per share, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 20%. It is estimated to report revenues of $4.65 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MDLZ.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for Alibaba, General Electric and Honeywell\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., General Electric Co. and Honeywell International. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\n\nBABA 's shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (-30.6% vs. +40.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that a weak China market, sluggishness in online physical goods GMV at Taobao and Tmall marketplaces, and stiff competition from the domestic as well as foreign e-commerce companies have weighed down on the company's fortunes. Unfavorable global macroeconomic goings on have also been a hindrance.\n\nHowever, the company's offline entertainment business segments, namely Damai and Alibaba Pictures have been a success. Also, solid momentum in the international commerce business is driving top-line growth.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here >>>)\n\nGeneral Electric's shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the last six months (+24.5% vs. -0.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that strength in the company's aerospace segment, gas power services and growth in grid and onshore wind businesses have been beneficial. The company has also made judicious acquisitions over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, high costs and operating expenses, a soft offshore wind business and supply chain disruptions in the defense market continue to remain major headwinds.\n\n(You can read the full research report on General Electric here >>>)\n\nShares of Honeywell have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past six months (+3.3% vs. -0.7%). Per the Zacks analyst, strength in the commercial aviation, aerospace and process solutions businesses augurs well for the company. New acquisitions like Compressor Controls are also likely to boost future growth.\n\nHowever, supply chain issues, lower volumes in the warehouse and workflow solutions, high cost of procuring raw materials and foreign currency headwinds continue to remain major concerns.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Honeywell here >>>)\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Palo Alto Networks, Inc. and Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "In this piece, we will look at the 20 Fastest Growing Technology Companies in the US. For more companies, head on over to 5 Fastest Growing Technology Companies in the US.\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving and interconnected society, technology plays a crucial role in fuelling creativity, revolutionizing sectors, and influencing our everyday experiences. Undoubtedly, technology stands as a significant and expanding economic sector. MGI Research projected that worldwide expenditure on technology, encompassing consumers, publicly traded and privately held businesses, non-profit entities, and government outlays, will increase from $8.51 trillion in 2022 to $11.47 trillion by 2026. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.75% over the five-year period.\n\nIn 2023, despite facing global economic challenges and geopolitical tensions, the tech industry forged ahead while generating considerable anticipation regarding the capabilities of AI. The potential for the upcoming year is evident. By prioritizing AI in their strategies, technology companies can potentially surpass competitors from other industries, who were once leading the pack; this is why AI deals and partnerships in 2024 could shape the future industry landscape. This involves not only expediting their transformation processes but also strategically repositioning their operations to seize upon swiftly emerging technologies and business frameworks.\n\nThe United States stands at the forefront of global technology innovation, setting the pace for advancements in various sectors. As of 2023, the United States region held approximately 36 percent of the global market share in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. The Consumer Technology Association anticipates that retail revenues for the U.S. consumer technology industry will increase by 2.8% in 2024, reaching $512 billion. This projection represents a $14 billion rise from the previous year, indicating a surge in consumer expenditure on technology products and services, as outlined in CTA's One-Year Industry Forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors hold an optimistic outlook for the American Information Technology industry, demonstrating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. Over the past three years, earnings for companies within the Information Technology sector have increased by 5.7% annually, while revenues have grown at a rate of 3.1% per year. This indicates a positive trend where these companies are generating more sales overall, leading to increased profits. Analysts are particularly bullish on the Semiconductors industry, forecasting a robust annual earnings growth rate of 24% over the next five years. This marks a significant improvement compared to its previous earnings decline of 1.0% per year. In contrast, the Tech Hardware industry is expected to experience more moderate earnings growth, with an anticipated rate of 5.9% per year over the coming years.\n\nLet's examine some of the major developments shaping the technology landscape in the United States. When discussing technological trends, it's essential to acknowledge the significant impact of generative AI on the tech market. The global AI market's value is estimated at $454 billion as of 2022 by Precendence Research and it is expected to hit a value of $2.75 trillion by 2032, growing at a high CAGR of 19% during the forecast period. This innovation gained widespread attention in 2023 following OpenAI's launch of GPT-4, showcasing impressive capabilities. Presently, nearly all major tech firms are dedicating resources to generative AI, with the initial half of 2023 witnessing a nearly fivefold surge in funding compared to the prior year. Anticipated for 2024 is a further increase in investment in generative AI across diverse sectors, spanning from medical research to entertainment. Every prominent tech corporation, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, is committing resources to pioneering advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nEmbark with us on an exhilarating journey through the dynamic realm of the United States' technology landscape, where 20 visionary companies have left an indelible mark on the digital frontier. From groundbreaking innovations in artificial intelligence to the lightning-fast strides of 5G connectivity, this transformative tapestry weaves together the stories of these trailblazing entities. Amidst the clouds of cloud computing excellence and the harmonious push for sustainability, these companies navigate the ever-shifting winds of government regulations, leaving an enduring imprint on how technology shapes our world and future.\n\nWith that said, let's head over to the list of the fastest-growing technology companies in the US. 20 Fastest Growing Technology Companies in the US\n\nA manufacturing floor filled with robotic arms working on a variety of precision projects.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to generate a list of the 20 Fastest Growing Technology Companies in the US by revenue, we sourced a comprehensive list of all energy companies in the US from the Finviz screener. We screened this list to find the top companies in the industry according to their market capitalizations.\n\nOnce we had obtained the list of the largest technology companies by market capitalization, we extracted companies that had the largest Year over Year (YoY) growth percentage in 2023. Year-over-year (YOY) growth is a key performance indicator comparing growth in one year-long period against the comparable period twelve months before the current year. Unlike standalone monthly metrics, YoY gives you a picture of your performance without seasonal effects, monthly volatility, and other factors.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

(35:40) - Episode Roundup: SMCI, PANW, NOW, SNAP, \u00a0PYPL, PATH Podcast@Zacks.com\n\nWelcome to Episode #390 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is joined by Zacks Stock Strategist and the Editor of Zacks Counterstrike and the Commodity Innovators portfolios, Jeremy Mullin, to talk about what Fibonacci levels are and how to use them to do better stock trades.\n\nWhat is a Fibonacci Level?\n\nFibonacci retracement levels are named after a medieval mathematician, Leonardo de Pisa, who later became known as Fibonacci. Some regard him as a math genius and the man who brought the Hindu/Arab numbering system to Europe.\n\nFibonacci retracement levels are a strategy that some traders use to analyze a stock\u2019s resistance levels. You can use many different retracement levels but one of the most common is 61.8%.\n\nHow do you use Fibonacci Levels?\n\nA lot of this podcast is looking at the charts on 5 popular stocks. Jeremy draws Fibonacci levels for each and discusses what he sees as retracement levels.\n\nTo get the most out of this podcast, please watch the video podcast to be able to see the charts, although Jeremy does an excellent job at explaining it for those only able to listen in on the audio podcast.\n\n5 Popular Stocks and Their Fibonacci Levels\n\n1. Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI)\n\nSuper Micro Computer has been the hottest stock on Wall Street over the last year. Yes, it\u2019s hotter than NVIDIA. Shares of Super Micro Computer are up 779% over the last year with some saying it has gone \u201cvertical\u201d in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nTracey recently bought shares of Super Micro Computer for the Insider Trader portfolio when an insider bought after the recent earnings report. She has taken some profit off the table this week.\n\nWhat does the Fibonacci levels tell us about Super Micro Computer\u2019s extraordinary rally?\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW)\n\nPalo Alto Networks is a red-hot stock in 2024, with the shares hitting new highs. It\u2019s up 125% over the last year and 387% over the last 5 years.\n\nBut is Palo Alto Networks now too hot to handle? It\u2019s up 13% in the last month alone.\n\nAre the Fibonacci levels signaling it may be time to short Palo Alto Networks? Or does the rally have more legs?\n\n3. ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)\n\nServiceNow has been a winning stock for years, with shares up 229% over the last 5 years. That easily beats the S&P 500\u2019s return of 78%. Shares of ServiceNow have also gained big in the last year, adding 68.8%.\n\nWhat signals are the Fibonacci levels sending traders on ServiceNow today?\n\n4. Snap Inc. (SNAP)\n\nSnap shares plunged recently after a disappointing earnings report, falling 32.2% over the last month. Over the last year, shares of Snap have moved in a narrow trading range and were up, but just 4.6%.\n\nIt\u2019s not as easy to deploy the Fibonacci levels on stocks with less volatility and narrow trading ranges but Jeremy shows examples of where the Fib levels would be.\n\nShould traders avoid stocks like Snap that have broken down?\n\n5. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)\n\nPayPal Holdings has fallen 27.9% over the last year. It\u2019s also down 4.5% over the last month.\n\nAnalysts have been cutting their 2024 earnings estimates over the last week. PayPal is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nEven as PayPal shares sink, do the Fibonacci levels indicate more pain may be coming?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Fibonacci Levels?\n\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of SMCI in Zacks Insider Trader portfolio.]\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street analysts forecast that Palo Alto Networks (PANW) will report quarterly earnings of $1.30 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 23.8%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $1.97 billion, exhibiting an increase of 19.1% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Palo Alto metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Product' will reach $361.71 million.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this security software maker have returned +10.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Palo Alto falls in, has gained 13.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Palo Alto is expected to post earnings of $1.30 per share, indicating a change of +23.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $5.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +23.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.43 indicates a change of +17.2% from what Palo Alto is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Palo Alto.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Palo Alto, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $8.17 billion and $9.65 billion estimates indicate +18.6% and +18% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPalo Alto reported revenues of $1.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.1%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.98%. The EPS surprise was +18.97%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPalo Alto is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palo Alto. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The cybersecurity industry is filled with high-growth companies. As cyber attacks become more common, corporations and small businesses will have to invest more money into cybersecurity solutions.\n\nWhile hackers are getting smarter, leading cybersecurity firms are keeping up with the trends. Some of them are using artificial intelligence to strengthen their offerings and keep data safe. Many cybersecurity stocks have outperformed the stock market over several years. Here are some of the top cybersecurity stocks to buy.\n\nFortinet (FTNT) The Fortinet logo on a wall\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) impressed many Wall Street investors after delivering a promising earnings report. While financial growth still doesn\u2019t resemble a cybersecurity firm quite yet, the company\u2019s growth indicate it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFortinet reported 10.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Product revenue dragged down revenue, but the company\u2019s service revenue grew by 24.8% year-over-year.\n\nThe most exciting development for the company is an 8.5% year-over-year growth in billings, an improvement from last quarter\u2019s 5.7% billings growth rate. A higher growth rate in this area raises the ceiling for next quarter\u2019s revenue growth.\n\nFortinet was regularly able to churn out quarter after quarter of 30%+ year-over-year revenue growth rate when its billings growth rate was at that same level. Fortinet\u2019s revenue growth decelerated when billings dropped. Positive developments in this part of Fortinet\u2019s financials can lead to better growth in the future.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Network (NASDAQ:PANW) is a cybersecurity firm that consistently outpaces the market. The equity has gained 127% over the past year and is up by 400% over the past five years.\n\nAs cyberattacks become more prevalent and lucrative for hackers, more businesses are turning to cybersecurity giants like Palo Alto Networks for protection. In a press release detailing\u00a0Q1 FY23 results, Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora cited an \u201cunprecedented level of attacks\u201d that helped the company expand its market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth to start off fiscal 2024. The company also announced that it expects Q2 FY24 revenue growth to fall in the range of 18% to 20%. Revenue for all of fiscal 2024 is expected to grow by 18% to 19% year-over-year.\n\nRevenue growth seems likely to continue, and profit margins are expanding rapidly. The firm grew its net income by 871% year-over-year in Q1 FY24 and achieved a double-digit net profit margin. Continued earnings growth and market expansion can help PANW reward long-term investors.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Generating revenue from recurring subscriptions, Crowdstrike finds it easier for the company to achieve high growth rates.\n\nImpressing investors, Crowdstrike saw 35% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024, with annual recurring revenue exceeded $3 billion. Investors have also been excited about the company\u2019s string of profitable quarters. Crowdstrike continued the trend with $26.7 million in GAAP net income attributable to the corporation.\n\nCrowdstrike has outpaced the stock market with a 202% gain over the past year. Shares are up by 413% over the past five years. Trading at a lofty 87 forward P/E ratio, the stock is expected to smooth out over time as the company continues to expand its profit margins.

        "title": "Why Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Palo Alto Networks Stocks Just Dropped",
        "content": "Tuesday dawned dark for both cybersecurity and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, and as of 10 a.m. ET, shares of Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Cloudflare(NYSE: NET) remain down 1.5%, 2.1%, and 4.7%, respectively.\n\nWhile the situation surrounding each company has its specifics (Cloudflare for instance reported strong earnings last week, Palo Alto is getting ready to report its earnings next week, and Microsoft is preparing an update on its Xbox business on Thursday), hackers appear to be the common reason behind today's declines.\n\nWho's getting hacked this time?\n\nThe Hacker News reported this morning on a couple of recent high-profile hacking incidents involving two of the companies on this list. In the first, Russian (allegedly) state-sponsored hacker group Midnight Blizzard has been blamed for using \"a password spray strategy\" to break in to the OAuth app to read the emails of some Microsoft senior staff and employees. Microsoft itself described this particular hack attack as beginning in November 2023.\n\nThe second incident likewise appears to have taken place in November, with Cloudflare being similarly attacked by an (unidentified) state actor. This incident harkens back to the 2023 Okta breach, utilizing credentials that were stolen and not changed since then. Hackers apparently went looking for Okta's internal reports of bugs in its own systems, presumably researching vulnerabilities that it could use to make further attacks on Atlassian.\n\nThe common theme behind all these attacks, argues Hacker News, seems to be that certain \"nation-state actors [are] targeting SaaS service providers\" for purposes of \"espionage and intelligence gathering.\"\n\nWhy are Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and Cloudflare stocks going down?\n\nSo why are Palo Alto Networks, Microsoft, and Cloudflare stocks -- all companies involved in cybersecurity -- getting stung if the hackers' ultimate target is actually providers of other SaaS services? Well, not to put too fine a point on it, but the hackers seem to be finding vulnerabilities in the defenses raised by the cybersecurity companies, and winning, if not the war, then at least isolated battles. That could shake investor confidence in the cybersecurity companies' effectiveness, and their value as investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe flip side of this argument, however, is that high-profile hacking incidents still do highlight the need for good cybersecurity -- and for cybersecurity stocks. The answer to the problem of cybersecurity efforts sometimes failing certainly cannot be \"well, let's just get rid of all our cybersecurity.\"\n\nTo the contrary, just this morning two separate investment banks raised their price targets on Palo Alto Networks shares ahead of next week's earnings report. One of these firms, Stifel, predicted that \"ongoing secular tailwinds\" will deliver \"a strong Q2 for Palo ... and at least a reaffirmed guide,\" according to a report on The Fly this morning. Jefferies seconded the emotion, predicting that Palo Alto will report better-than-expected sales, and that annual recurring revenue will grow 50% year over year. More than just a (great) number, if that turns out to be correct, it would imply that even more customers are making cybersecurity spending an ongoing line item of their operating costs -- and that's exactly what you would expect to happen in an environment of continued and increasing hacking attempts.\n\nWhile I admit to having some concerns about valuations in this sector, the fact that cybersecurity remains a growth industry cannot be denied.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cloudflare right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cloudflare, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Cloudflare wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "While exploring the stock market, identifying the return multipliers capable of monumental growth is similar to striking gold. Among these opportunities, three stocks stand out as potential wealth multipliers. They may hit 6X valuation in the next decade. This has led to this list of stocks to buy.\n\nFundamentally, these stocks are beyond symbols on a ticker tape. These companies have robust strategies and promising trajectories. These stocks hold fundamental qualities that set them apart in their respective sectors. This is making them edgy choices for rapid price returns.\n\nThe first on the list focuses on customer acquisition and expansion in international markets. Whereas the second one\u2019s diverse client base spans various industries and geographies. Finally, the third one dominates next-generation security solutions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRead more to dissect the strategic maneuvers behind the exponential growth potential of these stocks to buy. Learn about the key drivers fueling their ascent, position themselves to ride the wave of prosperity, and how they may unlock unprecedented wealth in the coming years.\n\nDocusign (DOCU) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) customer acquisition and expansion is vital to its valuations. Thus, DocuSign may constantly acquire new customers and boost its top-line growth. In Q3 fiscal 2024, the company added approximately 36K new customers, pushing its total customer base to 1.47 million. This represents an 11% year-over-year boost. Thus, this robust customer acquisition indicates the widespread adoption of DocuSign\u2019s solutions across various industries and geographies.\n\nAt its core, DocuSign has a strong brand reputation for e-signature and agreement management solutions. DocuSign\u2019s suite of products and features, including e-signature, CLM, and integrations with third-party platforms, forms a versatile solution to capitalize on document management market expansion. The company may continue to capture demand for use cases that are industry-specific.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, DocuSign focuses on expanding its reach among its existing client base to drive top-line growth. The company concentrates on increasing the annual contract value, particularly with customer holding values greater than\u00a0$300K. Also, DocuSign edges on its existing customer relationships to upsell additional products, including CLM, notary services, and identity verification solutions. By offering integrated solutions that address multiple aspects of the agreement lifecycle, DocuSign may continue to increase its share of wallets and deepen customer engagement. This makes it one of those stocks to buy.\n\nFinally, DocuSign\u2019s expansion into international markets reflects another edge of its customer expansion moves, which yielded positive results. For instance, international revenue grew\u00a018% year-over-year in Q3. Therefore, this indicates strong demand for the company\u2019s portfolio beyond its traditional North American market.\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis rising star, Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has a diverse customer base and an edge in market penetration. Super Micro\u2019s capability to engage with a diverse customer base across various verticals, industries, and geographies may continue to boost its value expansion potential.\n\nFundamentally, by catering to\u00a0different verticals and expanding its presence, the company can mitigate industry-specific risks (associated with concentration). As a result, it may continue to capitalize on emerging semiconductor trends in diverse markets.\n\nIn detail, Super Micro serves a vast range of customer segments, including the enterprise/channel, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) appliance, large data centers, emerging 5G, Telco, Edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. This diversified client base spreads the company\u2019s top-line. For instance, in fiscal Q2 2024, the enterprise/channel vertical accounted for\u00a040% of revenues, while the OEM appliance and large data center verticals represented 59%. This balanced top-line distribution suggests SMCI\u2019s lead in its versatility and adaptability.\n\nSimilarly, SMCI\u2019s footprint is another aspect of its market penetration strategy. With revenue distribution across regions, including the US (71%), Asia (18%), Europe (8%), and the rest of the world (3%), the company may continue to capture semiconductor demand in different geographical markets.\n\nLastly, another edge aspect of SMCI\u2019s rapid top-line growth is its capability to exceed its guidance. Despite setting initial revenue guidance for Q2 at\u00a0$2.9 billion, the company breached this estimate based on stronger-than-anticipated demand for its products and services. Such outperformance suggests SMCI\u2019s operational efficiency and agility in responding to market demand trends.\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) A man on the computer with transparent cybersecurity-looking icons floating around him like an aura\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) Next-Generation Security (NGS) annual recurring revenue growth suggests Palo Alto\u2019s traction in the market and the adoption of its advanced security solutions. NGS ARR exceeded $3 billion for the first time with a solid 53% year-over-year growth (Q1 fiscal 2024). This growth indicates the boosting demand for Palo Alto\u2019s NGS offerings and the company\u2019s ability to capture market share.\n\nFurthermore, NGS holds a range of advanced security solutions that target modern cybersecurity threats, including cloud security, endpoint protection, network security, and threat intelligence. The edgy growth in NGS ARR reflects Palo Alto\u2019s lead in delivering security solutions to enterprises. Also, the strong contributions across the portfolio indicate the broad-based adoption of Palo Alto\u2019s NGS offerings by customers across different industries and regions. This diverse customer base indicates sustained demand for advanced cybersecurity solutions and Palo Alto\u2019s capability to cater to various use cases and security requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, in Q1, Palo Alto attained total billings of $2.02 billion with a solid 16% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, deferred revenue hit $9.4 billion, a rapid 32% year-over-year boost. The growth in billings demonstrates Palo Alto\u2019s ability to secure new contracts, renew existing subscriptions, and expand its client base. Hence, this sustained momentum in billings signifies a strong demand for Palo Alto\u2019s solutions.\n\nFinally, cash flow generation and liquidity are core parts of Palo Alto\u2019s strategy. This provides the company with the resources needed for growth and capital allocation. In Q1, Palo Alto generated $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, with a trailing 12-month free cash flow margin of\u00a041%. Therefore, this proves that Palo Alto can convert operating income into liquidity through efficient working capital management. All in all, PANW is one of those stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For example, the Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) share price is up a whopping 385% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 45% gain in the last three months.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Palo Alto Networks investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\n\nView our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nGiven that Palo Alto Networks only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\n\nIn the last 5 years Palo Alto Networks saw its revenue grow at 22% per year. That's well above most pre-profit companies. Fortunately, the market has not missed this, and has pushed the share price up by 37% per year in that time. It's never too late to start following a top notch stock like Palo Alto Networks, since some long term winners go on winning for decades. So we'd recommend you take a closer look at this one, but keep in mind the market seems optimistic.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nPalo Alto Networks is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Palo Alto Networks in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Palo Alto Networks shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 119% over the last year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 37%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Palo Alto Networks that you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this freelist of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "To become a millionaire, most investors probably need to generate robust investment returns for years and even decades. To do that, you'll want to find high-quality businesses that are poised to grow their profit steadily over the long term.\n\nLet's look at three such companies.\n\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nCEO Warren Buffett has managed Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) for nearly six decades, delivering fortune-building gains for its shareholders. Yet Buffett's crowning achievement may be how he's built the company to thrive even after the legendary investor eventually steps down.\n\nBerkshire is a financial powerhouse, with diverse and battle-tested revenue streams. The investment conglomerate houses over 60 operating subsidiaries across a wide variety of industries, including insurance, railroads, real estate, energy, and retail. These competitively advantaged businesses generate annual free cash flow of approximately $27 billion.\n\nBerkshire's massive cash reserves also help to lessen the risks for its shareowners. With $157 billion in cash and equivalents on its fortress-like balance sheet as of Sept. 30, Buffett and his lieutenants have plenty of dry powder to use on new investment opportunities. Berkshire's equity portfolio is chock-full of quality stocks including Apple, Occidental Petroleum, and American Express -- and Buffett is always on the hunt for new additions.\n\nImportantly, Buffett has made certain Berkshire will remain in able hands after he retires. His hand-picked successor, Greg Abel, will take on the role of chief executive officer. And Buffett's trusted deputies, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are slated to manage the company's investments. Buffett, in turn, is confident that \"there will be no finish line\" for Berkshire Hathaway.\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks\n\nBetting on powerful long-term trends is another proven path to wealth. The rising need for effective cyber defenses is one such trend -- and Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW) is a formidable force in this rapidly expanding industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more of the world shifts online, massive amounts of data are being stored in the cloud. Demand for tools that safeguard this sensitive information could top $500 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Looking further ahead, consulting firm McKinsey estimates that the total addressable market for cybersecurity services could eventually approach a staggering $2 trillion.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' broad array of products and entrenched customer relationships give it an edge over its rivals. From next-generation firewalls to endpoint protection, the cyber guardian's platform provides a simplified yet comprehensive solution to its customers' growing lists of challenges. Moreover, with over 80,000 corporate clients, Palo Alto Networks can collect more data to strengthen its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered threat detection and prevention offerings.\n\nWith demand for its services booming, analysts see Palo Alto Networks growing its profits by more than 22% annually over the next half-decade. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside this cybersecurity leader.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nLike Palo Alto Networks, Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR) stands to benefit from advances in AI. The data analytics specialist helps its customers reap valuable insights from their mountains of data.\n\nPalantir earned its stripes as a counterterrorism partner with the U.S. Defense Department and its allies. The company's software continues to play an important role in helping the U.S. government and its allies protect their citizens from a growing list of threats. Palantir was recently awarded contracts from the U.S. Army and the U.S. Special Operations Command that together could be worth more than $700 million.\n\nBusinesses are also keen to harness the power of Palantir's technology. Its U.S. commercial revenue surged by 70% year over year to $131 million in the fourth quarter. The gains were driven by a 55% jump in customers, to 221.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, CEO Alex Karp said that \"unrelenting\" demand for AI models is creating enormous interest in Palantir's new Artificial Intelligence Platform. The decision-centric system combines the company's powerful machine-learning technology with real-time data and secure access to advanced AI models.\n\nBetter still, Palantir's profitability is rapidly improving as it scales its revenue base. Its adjusted operating margin has expanded for five straight quarters. Management, in turn, expects the AI leader to generate an adjusted operating profit of as much as $850 million in 2024, up from $633 million in 2023.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks Are Liable to Be Familiar Names",
        "content": "Volatility is a given when putting your money to work on Wall Street. However, volatility has been heightened for a majority of the decade. Over the previous four years, Wall Street's major stock indexes have bounced between bear and bull markets in successive years.\n\nWhen volatility and uncertainty rule the roost on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to seek out the safety of time-tested and outperforming industry leaders. A perfect example over the past decade has been the \"FAANG stocks.\" But since the midpoint of 2021, companies enacting stock splits have been especially popular. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have been gravitating to stock-split stocks for years\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to change both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors (i.e., a forward-stock split), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (i.e., a reverse-stock split).\n\nAlthough some companies that have enacted reverse splits have gone on to deliver big-time gains to their shareholders, the bulk of investors' interest in stock-split stocks lies with those conducting forward splits.\n\nFor more than a year, I've been highlighting nine of the most high-profile and widely owned businesses to have completed forward splits since July 2021. In chronological order, this includes:\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 4-for-1 split in 2021. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 20-for-1 split in 2022. DexCom(NASDAQ: DXCM): 4-for-1 split in 2022. Shopify(NYSE: SHOP): 10-for-1 split in 2022. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 20-for-1 split in 2022. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA): 3-for-1 split in 2022. Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW): 3-for-1 split in 2022. Monster Beverage(NASDAQ: MNST): 2-for-1 split in 2023. Novo Nordisk(NYSE: NVO): 2-for-1 split in 2023.\n\nStory continues NVDA Chart\n\nAside from the similarity of completing a forward-stock split and handily outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 over long periods, these nine former stock-split stocks all bring easily identifiable competitive advantages and/or seemingly untouchable moats to the table.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of the share of GPUs in use in artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated data centers this year. Amazon's online marketplace brings in about 40% of online retail sales in the U.S., while Amazon Web Services is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services provider. DexCom is a top-two player in continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs) and has developed numerous generations of CGMs for diabetics. Shopify is the leading provider of e-commerce software platforms in the United States, as of 2023. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share in January, while Google Cloud is the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure services share. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only pure-play EV producer that's generating a recurring profit. Palo Alto Networks is one of the largest next-generation firewall solutions providers in the cybersecurity space. Monster Beverage is the second-leading provider of energy drinks in the U.S., with a 30% share in 2023. Novo Nordisk is a dominant player in the global insulin market, as well as a key innovator of injectable GLP-1 drugs, which have induced weight loss in patients.\n\nMore importantly, among these nine former stock-split stocks are two companies that appear ripe for yet another split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nOut of the nine high-profile stock-split stocks over the past two-and-a-half years, none has a more compelling case to conduct yet another split than semiconductor stock Nvidia. When Nvidia enacted its 4-for-1 split in July 2021, its share price was at roughly $750. Last week, Nvidia's stock hit a fresh (split-adjusted) all-time high of just over $700 per share.\n\nAs noted, artificial intelligence is the driving force behind Nvidia's surging sales and profits. The company's A100 and H100 GPUs have been the clear top choice by businesses looking to incorporate AI solutions and generative AI into their growth strategies.\n\nWhat's been particularly helpful for Nvidia is that demand for AI-fueled GPUs has handily outstripped the supply of these chips. Though Nvidia would probably love to sell more of its A100 and H100 chips, this scarcity has sent the price for existing AI-GPUs into the stratosphere. Whereas Nvidia's cost of revenue has only modestly moved higher, data center sales should have more than doubled in fiscal 2024 (which ended in late January).\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that leading chip-fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is in the process of dramatically increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity. CoWoS is a practical necessity in high-compute data centers given the need to incorporate high-bandwidth memory. Thus, Taiwan Semi's actions should help Nvidia meaningfully ramp production in the current calendar year.\n\nNevertheless, red flags remain with Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence stock -- and not even a potential stock split will whisk them away.\n\nNvidia is beginning to see competition take shape both externally and internally. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year, while Intel unveiled its Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 generative AI software chip in December. Meanwhile, Nvidia's top revenue customers, Microsoft and Meta Platforms, are in the process of developing AI chips of their own to lessen their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nTo boot, every next-big-thing investment trend over the last 30 years has worked its way through an initial bubble. The fear of missing out (better known as \"FOMO\") has a tendency to lift investor expectations well ahead of tangible demand with next-big-thing trends. Artificial intelligence is unlikely to be the exception.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\n\nThe other former stock-split stock that appears ready for round two is none other than cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks. When Palo Alto effected its 3-for-1 forward split in mid-September 2022, its share price was near $550. In the 17 months since conducting its split, shares of the company have more than doubled and are approaching $370.\n\nThe beauty of cybersecurity is that it's become nothing short of a basic necessity for businesses with an online or cloud-based presence. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy is performing, businesses with an online or cloud presence need cybersecurity solutions to protect their data and that of their customers from hackers and robots that don't take a day off.\n\nThe catalyst that's really helped power Palo Alto Networks' gains over the past five years is its purposeful shift away from physical firewall products and toward cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. By the end of fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends July 31), less than 62% of Palo Alto's net sales were traced back to subscriptions and support. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31, 2023), nearly 82% of its sales derived from subscriptions and support.\n\nA cloud-based SaaS operating model is genius for a number of reasons. First, the incorporation of AI and machine learning allows Palo Alto's solutions to be nimbler and more responsive than on-premises security solutions. A subscription-based model also helps with customer retention and can lead to more consistent payouts from clients throughout the year, relative to physical firewall products. And third, a cloud-based SaaS model generates considerably juicier margins than selling physical firewall products.\n\nAdd-on sales are another reason Palo Alto Networks has been virtually unstoppable. The company's high-margin Prisma Cloud platform saw the number of customers purchasing five or more cloud modules grow by a jaw-dropping 166% in the fiscal first quarter, compared to the prior-year period. Palo Alto is landing bigger clients, and it's having success getting many of its larger clients to progressively spend more.\n\nAlthough Palo Alto Networks' stock is historically pricey, average annual earnings growth of at least 20% is a real possibility through the end of the decade, if not well beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy in February",
        "content": "The world is progressively becoming more digital. There are billions of smartphones and connected devices, and companies increasingly work remotely and rely on cloud services. With this rise in technology has also come an increase in cyberattacks.\n\nAccording to IBM's 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report, 51% of organizations were planning to increase investments in security as a result of a breach. The average cost of a data breach globally was over $4.45 million, up 15% from three years ago. And that's just one type of cyberattack.\n\nAs attacks become more frequent (and expensive), the need for cybersecurity solutions has amplified, putting the industry in indispensable territory. For investors wanting to go along for the ride, here are three top cybersecurity stocks to buy in February.\n\n1. CrowdStrike\n\nIf you were anywhere near the tech world in the past year, you know how unavoidable artificial intelligence (AI) has been. It has gone mainstream recently, but AI has been around for a while. One of the companies that helped usher in AI in its industry is CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ: CRWD). Since 2011, it has been using AI to power its cybersecurity solutions.\n\nCrowdStrike isn't just a recipient of AI hype; its business results show the company is one of the premier cybersecurity stocks in the industry. It offers different modules that address a broad range of cybersecurity needs, and 63% of its subscription customers use at least five modules. Around 26% use seven or more.\n\nGrowing subscriptions and a comprehensive ecosystem helped CrowdStrike achieve $3.2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in its 2023 third quarter (ended Oct. 31), up 35% year over year (YOY). Its operating income surged 81% YOY to $356 million, showing increased profitability, and the margins on that income were also up 9% from two years prior.\n\nCrowdStrike stock isn't necessarily cheap, but it should be an excellent long-term investment for those who can stomach the volatility likely to come with it.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Palo Alto Networks\n\nFounded in 2005, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) is one of the older pure cybersecurity companies. It's also one of the largest, with a market cap of over $100 billion (as of Feb. 5), thanks to a 120% stock price jump over the past 12 months.\n\nMany cybersecurity companies offer various products, but Palo Alto Networks prides itself on essentially being a one-stop shop. Whether it's firewalls, advanced threat protection, or cloud security, the company offers a comprehensive suite of tools.\n\nIn the first quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, it made $1.88 billion in revenue, up 20% year over year. Investors shouldn't expect the same growth as you would from younger cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike, but there's something to be said about Palo Alto's improving profitability.\n\nIn its latest quarter, it had operating income of $529 million with 28% margins. In the same period last year, those numbers were $322 million and 21%, respectively.\n\nPalo Alto Networks has a customer base of large clients that need thorough solutions, and the company has been effective at providing them. If you want a company that operates on the full spectrum of cybersecurity, this is your go-to.\n\n3. Cisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) is a cybersecurity company with a slightly different approach than the other two on this list. While CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are focused on cybersecurity software, Cisco's bread and butter has long been its hardware.\n\nAlthough hardware is what largely made Cisco the $200 billion company it is today, it has been taking steps to compete more directly with cybersecurity software. Its $28 billion acquisition of Splunk (expected to close later this year) is one of the clearest signs of the company's strategic shift toward enhancing its software choices. The deal should boost its security portfolio.\n\nBecoming more service-focused should benefit Cisco because it provides more recurring revenue than hardware sales. It won't be (and hasn't been) the quickest transition, but there are signs of progress despite some economic headwinds in the past couple of years.\n\nIn the meantime, Cisco's dividend should help buy it some patience from investors. The quarterly dividend is $0.39, with a yield of around 3.1%. That's well over double the S&P 500's recent average.\n\nMore importantly, investors don't have to question the dividend's stability. It has increased every year since Cisco began paying one in 2011.\n\nCisco can be a chance for investors to get exposure to the cybersecurity industry and simultaneously receive consistent income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and CrowdStrike wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing in tech stocks can get you closer to your financial goals. Time in the stock market beats timing the stock market, and you can experience higher gains if you focus on the right sectors.\n\nTech stocks have been a promising avenue for many years. This sector is filled with innovation and firms that consistently deliver double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. If you want to get closer to your financial objectives, you may want to consider these top tech stocks.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has rallied as artificial intelligence investments are picking up. The company is well positioned with its Trident 5-X12 chips to gain market share in the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI tools need good chips to run smoothly. In fact, they need chips from companies like Broadcom to even function. While artificial intelligence represents one growth opportunity, many industries heavily rely on chipmakers.\n\nYou\u2019ll find semiconductors in computers, smartphones, refrigerators, cars, and other resources. As long as these products stay in demand, chip makers like Broadcom will continue to produce and sell their chips.\n\nThe Trident 5-X12 consumes 25% less power per 400G port than the Trident 4-X9. The chip offers many benefits, including NPL programmability and a bandwidth that\u2019s 16.0 Terabits per second.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s commitment to improving its chips will help it gain market share and remain a top choice for many corporations, making it one of the tech stocks not to miss.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI)\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) is up 600% over the past year and can realistically extend its gains throughout 2024. The company has several catalysts in its favor.\n\nThe first catalyst is the rising demand for Supermicro\u2019s servers. These servers are built to handle the high workload of artificial intelligence.\n\nCorporations are scrambling to leverage AI, and Supermicro has become the equivalent of a shovel seller in the middle of a gold rush.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue and earnings growth both show a promising opportunity. Supermicro reported 103% year-over-year revenue growth and 68.2% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q2 FY24.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance calls for $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024. The midpoint represents a 103.7% year-over-year increase compared to the $7.12 billion in\u00a0FY 2023 revenue.\n\nWhile investors are excited about the company\u2019s position in the AI industry, another opportunity is present in the background. Supermicro fulfills the requirements for inclusion in the\u00a0S&P 500. Fund managers will have to load up on the stock to continue mirroring the S&P 500.\n\nAs Supermicro\u2019s market cap grows, fund managers of the S&P 500 will have to buy more shares. That\u2019s because the S&P 500 uses\u00a0weighted averages for its positions. Tech stocks with higher market caps have larger positions in the index than equities with lower market caps.\n\nAxcelis Technologies (ACLS) Image of the Axcelis (ACLS) logo on a web browser amplified through the lens of a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxcelis Technologies (NASDAQ:ACLS) produces equipment that top semiconductor corporations use to produce chips. The company\u2019s excellent position in the semiconductor industry has resulted in a 523% gain over the past five years.\n\nAxcelis Technologies regularly reports high revenue and earnings growth alongside net profit margins above 20%. The company reported 27.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 63.7% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe semiconductor firm closed out the quarter with a $1.2 billion backlog. That backlog is higher than what the company projects to earn throughout 2023. An extensive backlog and enticing growth rates can help Axcelis Technologies can more market share and reward long-term investors.\n\nAnalysts are feeling bullish about Axcelis Technologies and believe the stock has more to gain. Among six analysts, the\u00a0average price target is $164.67 which implies a 23.4% upside. Impressive financial growth combined with a 19 P/E ratio makes the projected price target plausible.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is one of the more interesting tech stocks out there because it offers enticing revenue and customer growth that can turn the equity into a long-term winner.\n\nThe corporation reported 26% year-over-year revenue growth and 22% year-over-year customer growth in\u00a0Q3 2023. The company closed out the quarter with over 194,000 customers.\n\nHubSpot generates revenue from its customer relationship management software. Businesses can use HubSpot to engage with current customers and attract new prospects. Customers pay a high price for the software. The average subscription revenue per customer came to $11,520.\n\nMany investors have noticed HubSpot stock and bid it up significantly. The 1-year gain stands at 68% while the 5-year gain is currently 270%.\n\nHubSpot has 23 ratings which include\u00a021 \u201cBuy\u201d ratings. The highest price target of $700 implies a 14.4% gain from the current price point.\n\nA profitable quarter can help HubSpot realize this price target, and that quarter may be coming up. HubSpot only reported a $5.5 million net loss in the third quarter which was a good improvement over its $31.4 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) coins and plants growting up from the ground to represent growth stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is checking all the boxes you would expect from a growth stock.\n\nRevenue increased by 43% year-over-year in\u00a0Q3 2023 and the company reported a profitable quarter. This switch to profitability can cause meaningful profit margin expansion in the next few quarters.\n\nDuolingo is also getting more traction on its app. Monthly active users increased by 47% year-over-year while the number of daily active users surged by 63% year-over-year.\n\nTotal bookings and subscription bookings had year-over-year growth rates of 49% and 54% year-over-year respectively. Those backlogs imply Duolingo will continue to report exceptional revenue growth.\n\nThe stock has rallied by 84% over the past year and trades at a $7.5 billion market cap. The\u00a0average analyst price target of $198 implies a 10.7% upside. The highest price came in at $230 and suggests the stock will rally by roughly 28% from current levels.\n\nInvestors will have to be patient with this stock due to its vast growth potential being paired with a lofty valuation. The stock trades at a 95 forward P/E ratio and a 17 price-to-sales ratio. The upside seems promising, but the valuation is a risk to keep in mind.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud computing and cybersecurity stock that has comfortably outperformed the market. The stock has gained 72% over the past year and is up by 242% over the past five years.\n\nShares trade at a lofty 59 forward P/E ratio but rapid net income growth is making the valuation look more reasonable. Net income more than tripled year-over-year in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. During that same quarter, total revenue increased by 26% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s entry into generative artificial intelligence gives investors another reason to feel confident in the equity. ServiceNow Chairman and CEO Bill McDermott offered these optimistic statements in the press release.\n\n\u201cGenerative AI is injecting new fuel into our already high\u2011performing engine. ServiceNow\u2019s intelligent platform for end\u2011to\u2011end digital transformation is driving massive leaps in productivity and explosive growth. This is a breakthrough moment,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAnalysts are in agreement about a breakthrough moment on the way. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with 28 out of 29 analysts rating it as a \u201cBuy.\u201d The average price point suggests an 8.4% upside while the highest price target of $910 suggests a 16.5% upside.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a high-flying cybersecurity stock that has gained 121% over the past year and has a 5-year gain of 361%. Revenue and net income growth have excited many investors.\n\nThe firm reported 20% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a01Q FY24. The growth in remaining performance obligations came in at 26% year-over-year and outpaced revenue. That\u2019s a good sign for continued revenue growth.\n\nPalo Alto Networks also reported 871% year-over-year net income growth. Rapidly expanding profit margins can reduce the stock\u2019s P/E ratio and bring more value to investors.\n\nDemand is growing for Palo Alto Networks\u2019 cybersecurity solutions because of the rise of cyber attacks. There was a 37% year-over-year increase in multi-extortion ransomware attacks and a 28% year-over-year increase in the\u00a0average ransomware payment.\n\nCyber attacks can get expensive in a hurry because of lost assets and a damaged reputation. Many businesses would rather work with Palo Alto Networks than risk becoming victims of cyber attacks.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO, SMCI, ACLS, and NOW.

        "content": "In cybersecurity and tech, the emergence of AI has become a moat for companies. These titans are not merely players in the market but architects of change. They are reshaping industry norms and redefining the very essence of cybersecurity solutions.\n\nThe first one strides ahead with an unparalleled reach, boasting staggering penetration into the prestigious Global 2000 list. It reflects its widespread influence across diverse sectors. Meanwhile, the second one leverages cutting-edge AI integration. That is represented by its groundbreaking AI product, which fortifies the company\u2019s position in autonomous cybersecurity solutions. In strategic partnerships and innovative AI-driven solutions, the third emerges as a visionary, creating alliances with tech giants and harnessing the power of AI to unlock unprecedented growth potential.\n\nRead the article to learn more about these three AI-centric leaders. Uncover the fundamentals behind the top three AI stocks poised to redefine market dynamics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s (NASDAQ:PANW) capability to secure deals across various customer types is vital to its valuations. There are deals signed by federal government agencies, global SaaS providers, education organizations and even nation-states.\n\nPalo Alto\u2019s systematic approach to platformization is reflected in the penetration of its solutions across 56% of the Global 2000. Also, this diversified and expansive engagement reflects Palo Alto\u2019s reach and the rapid adoption of its cybersecurity solutions across different industry verticals.\n\nNotably, there is an increase in recurring revenue across Palo Alto Networks, constituting 83% of total revenue in Q1 2024 compared to 77% a year ago. This growth highlights Palo Alto\u2019s lead in transforming its business model towards a more predictable and sustainable topline.\n\nAdditionally, Palo Alto\u2019s focus on strategic investments can be observed in its acquisitions, including Talon Cyber Security and Dig Security Solutions. These acquisitions strategically enhance Palo Alto\u2019s portfolio, addressing specific cybersecurity challenges and contributing to its topline growth. Industry recognition, such as Cortex XDR achieving 100% protection and detection in the MITRE evaluation, further boosts Palo Alto\u2019s position as an industry leader in delivering edgy cybersecurity solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Palo Alto\u2019s investments in AI-driven products have resulted in significant pipeline expansion and customer adoption. Introducing AI-enabled solutions such as Cloud Manager, Network Security and Cortex XSIAM has likely fueled increased demand from customers seeking advanced security capabilities. The robust pipeline for XSIAM, with over $1 billion in potential deals, suggests strong market interest in Palo Alto\u2019s AI-driven security operations.\n\nFinally, the continued growth in recurring revenue, particularly in next-generation security (NGS) annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeding $3 billion, reflects Palo Alto\u2019s AI-centric approach to capitalizing on AI demand and driving sustainable value growth.\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo begin with, SentinelOne\u2019s (NYSE:S) total customer base exceeding 11.5K in Q3 2024 signifies a broad reach in the market. Expanding the customer base is vital to reflect the company\u2019s capability to cater to diverse enterprises.\n\nNotably, the growth rates in customers with more than $100K and $1 million of ARR indicate a lead in the high-value customer segments. A 33% growth in customers with more than $100K ARR and even faster growth in customers with more than $1 million ARR suggests the company\u2019s effectiveness in capturing stable topline (with larger enterprises).\n\nFurthermore, the increase in ARR per customer is a positive signal for the company\u2019s capability to extract more value from existing customer relationships. This growth implies that customers stay with SentinelOne and expand their engagement and investment.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on the leads of managed security service provider (MSSP) partnerships as the fastest-growing channel category aligns with industry trends. MSSPs are increasingly critical in addressing mid-market and small to medium-sized businesses\u2019 (SMBs) security needs.\n\nFurther, there is triple-digit growth in Singularity Cloud and Singularity Data Lake solutions. That reflects the market\u2019s strong demand for these offerings. Hence, this growth suggests that enterprises recognize the value of a unified data and security platform.\n\nFinally, the introduction of Purple AI represents a significant edge for SentinelOne, further enhancing its AI capabilities. Purple AI\u2019s integration across the Singularity platform enables advanced threat detection, simplified threat hunting and automated response mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, by supercharging Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and data analysts, Purple AI accelerates incident response times and enhances overall cybersecurity posture. This innovation differentiates SentinelOne from competitors and gives it an edge in delivering autonomous cybersecurity solutions.\n\nInnodata (INOD) hands typing on a computer keyboard under a computer screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFor Innodata (NASDAQ:INOD), customer relationships and expansion opportunities are the factors breeding value growth. The existence of master service agreements with five of the largest technology companies globally represents Innodata\u2019s strategic partnerships. The revenue run rate with one major tech customer is expected to reach $23 million to $25 million in 2023. Innodata\u2019s lead in forging relationships with major tech players positions it at the forefront of the generative AI revolution.\n\nNotably, the land-and-expand strategy is a smart approach to building long-term partnerships. That demonstrates the company\u2019s focus on delivering value and fostering mutually beneficial collaborations. Notably, Q3 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $3.2 million marked a notable 100% sequential quarter-on-quarter growth, demonstrating the company\u2019s operational efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, the $1.6 million in sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA and $2.5 million in sequential quarter-on-quarter revenue growth highlights substantial operating leverage. Also, the correlation between revenue growth and EBITDA expansion suggests the company\u2019s adeptness in managing costs in tandem with increased business activities.\n\nWith a forecasted Q4 revenue of $24.5 million or more, representing a projected 26% or higher year-over-year growth, Innodata anticipates sustained momentum. The forecasted adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 million or more for Q4 signals a robust bottom line.\n\nSpecifically, the enterprise market represents a significant growth opportunity for Innodata. Over the past years, Innodata\u2019s investments in AI have galvanized Innodata\u2019s competitive edge in the AI-driven solutions market. The development of AI-enabled platforms like PR Co-pilot reflects the company\u2019s focus on effectively capitalizing on emerging AI market demands.\n\nOverall, Innodata\u2019s edgy combination of scalable domain expertise, global reach and AI capabilities sets it apart from competitors, enabling it to drive massive growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nYiannis Zourmpanos is the founder of Yiazou Capital Research, a stock-market research platform designed to elevate the due diligence process through in-depth business analysis.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: February 2024",
        "content": "Cybersecurity stocks represent the firms that protect digital systems and assets from malicious actors. In a rapidly digitizing world, the demand for such services is obvious. Growth forecasts reiterate the notion of rising demand. The cybersecurity sector is expected to grow at an annual rate approaching 10% between now and 2028.\n\nThe rapid emergence of artificial intelligence has only heightened the demand for cybersecurity. More and more data is being produced and transferred than ever before. Yet, at the same time, AI promises to bolster cybersecurity in a strengthening market. With 2024 shaping to be bullish, it makes sense to consider cybersecurity stocks as an investment.\n\nTenable Holdings (TENB) A close-up shot of fingers over a keyboard with blue and white text overlaid.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTenable Holdings (NASDAQ:TENB) provides cybersecurity software to over 40,000 enterprises globally. Nessus is the most notable product from the company that serves more than 60% of the Fortune 500.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTenable Holdings won\u2019t wow investors with exceptionally high growth projections. It does benefit from strong analyst ratings on Wall Street, but consensus target prices aren\u2019t dramatically higher than current prices.\n\nYet, Tenable Holdings is a solid firm that initiated a 100 million share buyback back in November. The company has also doubled the number of high-value accounts under its Management in the past few years. In late 2020, the company had slightly more than 750 $100,000 accounts. Per the last count, it has more than 1,550 such accounts.\n\nFurther, Tenable Holdings continues to slash operational losses as it becomes a more efficient firm overall. TENB shares represent a solid cyber security firm that doesn\u2019t get much attention but remains worth considering.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a cloud computing stock at its heart, but the company also is engaged in cybersecurity.\n\nThere are multiple reasons to invest in Microsoft: a huge presence in artificial intelligence and the booming growth of the cloud sector are the chief reasons overall. No one will suggest that Microsoft is a cybersecurity leader. However, its increasing presence in the field is worth considering.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft plans to implement AI tools into its cybersecurity platform, Microsoft Security Copilot. Microsoft is at the forefront of generative AI. Many worry that generative AI will increase The incidence of cybersecurity breaches, including ransomware attacks.\n\nSo, Microsoft will provide the antidote to the problem for which it is partially responsible.\n\nOverall, it is another consideration for those on the fence regarding Microsoft as it marches to historically High prices. Those prices are justified in the minds of many who cite 30% growth out of its cloud segment. Microsoft will continue to invest heavily in AI to bolster the strength of the Azure cloud. That alone is worth investing in; the cyber security slant makes it much more so.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the bigger, more established cybersecurity stocks available to investors. It has started 2024 on the right foot, climbing from $290 to $340.\n\nThe company is one of the leading names in the SASE market. The acronym stands for Secure Access Service Edge. SASE Is a framework for delivering network and security services as a cloud-based service.\n\nPalo Alto Networks plans to Upgrade security operations centers with artificial intelligence this year. That has many analysts assuming that the company will continue to grow. Ostensibly, that is one of the reasons Palo Alto Networks has performed so well through the first month of 2024.\n\nPalo Alto Networks primarily focuses on prevention instead of response and mitigation. The company\u2019s flagship product is its Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW). It is there that Palo Alto Networks shines, with the firewall product quickly becoming an industry standard. With cybersecurity projected to continue to grow quickly in 2024 PANW stock is a strong choice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Fortinet, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks Stocks Zoomed Higher Today",
        "content": "Wednesday is shaping up to be a good day to own cybersecurity stocks: Powerful fourth-quarter earnings from network security company Fortinet(NASDAQ: FTNT) sent its stock up by 3%, and provided a tailwind to shares of peers CrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD), and Palo Alto Networks(NASDAQ: PANW). Through 11:45 a.m. ET, those two stocks were up 5.8% and 7%, respectively.\n\nReporting its fourth-quarter results Tuesday after the close, Fortinet beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Instead of the $0.43 per share (adjusted) profit on $1.41 billion in sales it was expected to report, the company earned $0.51 per share on sales of $1.42 billion.\n\nFortinet Q4 sales and earnings\n\nTheFly.com has counted no fewer than 16 analysts raising their price targets on Fortinet in response to its report. And yet, how good was Fortinet's news, actually?\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that it actually wasn't all that great. True, sales for the quarter grew by a respectable 10% year over year. But billings -- which foreshadow future revenue growth -- grew by only 8.5%, implying a slowdown may lurk just around the corner.\n\nNon-GAAP profits exceeded expectations, and were up a strong 16%. But earnings as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles were only $0.40 per share for the quarter -- flat year over year. Worst of all, free cash flow plummeted by 67% to just $165 million.\n\nMost of these numbers, by the way, reflected a significant slowdown in growth compared to Fortinet's performance earlier in the year. Over the course of 2023, Fortinet scored sales growth of 20%, billings growth of 14%, non-GAAP profits growth of 37% -- and GAAP earnings growth of 38%. (To give credit where credit is due, however, its free cash flow for the year did grow 19%.)\n\nWhat does Fortinet's earnings beat mean for CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks?\n\nSo yes, Fortinet \"beat earnings.\" And yes, investors in peer cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks have reason to breathe a sigh of relief ... for now. All that being said, as an investor in one of these three stocks (Palo Alto), Fortinet's performance in Q4 actually has me feeling just a tiny bit nervous. Consider this:\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of the slowdown seen in Q4, Fortinet's guidance for the first quarter -- and for 2024 as a whole -- holds reasons for worry. Management is predicting that sales in Q1 will land in the $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion range. The entirety of this range falls short of Wall Street's consensus expectation of $1.37 billion. Similarly, for the year, Fortinet predicts revenues between $5.72 billion and $5.82 billion -- but Wall Street wants to see $5.93 billion.\n\nGranted, on earnings, the near term looks a bit better. Fortinet's Q1 guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.39 implies the company thinks it could beat Wall Street's forecast for $0.37 per share. But the midpoint of the company's earnings guidance for the year implies the company might struggle to earn the $1.67 per share that analysts are expecting it to earn -- and Fortinet gave no guidance at all for GAAP profits, nor for free cash flow.\n\nNow, look ahead to the upcoming earnings reports from Palo Alto Networks (due Feb. 20) and CrowdStrike (due March 5). In each case, Wall Street has its expectations set high, predicting that Palo Alto will report 24% quarterly earnings growth in Q4 ... and that CrowdStrike will grow its profits by 75%. Those are aggressive targets. Even more worrisome is the fact that analysts will want to see both companies express similarly high hopes for 2024. To avoid disappointing investors, Palo Alto must promise to keep on growing its earnings at 24% for another year. CrowdStrike, meanwhile, must promise an accelerating growth rate: 92% growth.\n\nWith both of these stocks already trading at extremely high multiples to forward earnings -- 64.5 for Palo Alto and 81.3 for CrowdStrike -- they look priced for perfection. Any stumble on earnings day -- be it in the actual results they report or the future earnings they predict -- could send either or both stocks plummeting.\n\nCaveat investor.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Fortinet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Fortinet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Fortinet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Is Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PANW) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?",
        "content": "Palo Alto Networks' (NASDAQ:PANW) stock is up by a considerable 41% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Palo Alto Networks'  ROE.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Palo Alto Networks is:\n\n28% = US$614m \u00f7 US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.28 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nPalo Alto Networks' Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Palo Alto Networks has a significantly high ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 9.8% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 23% net income growth seen by Palo Alto Networks over the past five years isn't overly surprising.\n\nWe then compared Palo Alto Networks' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 17% in the same 5-year period.\n\nStory continues past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PANW? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nIs Palo Alto Networks Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nPalo Alto Networks doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Palo Alto Networks' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.
