You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nHyatt Hotels Corporation H delivered second-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. The company\u2019s top line declined year over year.\r\n\r\nThe timing of Easter, renovations at major resort properties and the lingering impact of the 2023 Maui wildfires affected the company's performance. As of Jun 30, 2024, Hyatt had a pipeline of executed management or franchise contracts of approximately 670 hotels (or about 130,000 rooms). Management anticipates 2024 system-wide RevPAR to rise 3-4% from the 2023 level, down from the prior estimated range of 3-5%.\r\n\r\nMGM Resorts International MGM reported impressive second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom and top lines increased on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the quarter, the company exhibited strong financial performance and growth, setting a record for MGM China Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, it stated the benefits of Las Vegas expansion and strategic partnership with Marriott. MGM\u2019s meetings and convention business witnessed improvement, supported by the remodel of Mandalay Bay. Given the strategic initiatives and significant progress, management is optimistic and anticipates the momentum to continue for the remainder of 2024.\r\n\r\nJAKKS Pacific, Inc. JAKK reported second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the bottom and top lines missed the consensus estimate for the third straight quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s performance was hindered by soft sales in the Toys/Consumer Products segment due to lower sales in North America, accompanied by a fall in the Costumes sales. Furthermore, increased SG&A expenses, risks underlining the Costume business and depleting liquidity were additional headwinds.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Participants\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe; Chief Financial Officer; Wynn Resorts Ltd\n\nCraig Billings; Chief Executive Officer, Director; Wynn Resorts Ltd\n\nBrian Gullbrants; Chief Operating Officer - North America; Wynn Resorts Ltd\n\nCarlo Santarelli; Analyst; Deutsche Bank\n\nJoe Greff; Analyst; JPMorgan\n\nShaun Kelley; Analyst; BofA Global Research\n\nDan Politzer; Analyst; Wells Fargo Securities, LLC\n\nStephen Grambling; Analyst; Morgan Stanley\n\nDavid Katz; Analyst; Jefferies\n\nRobin Farley; Analyst; UBS Equities\n\nBrandt Montour; Analyst; Barclays\n\nChad Beynon; Analyst; Macquarie Research\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the Wynn Resorts second-quarter 2024 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nThank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto, and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nThanks, Julie. Good afternoon, and as always, thank you for joining us today. I want to start by saying thank you to my nearly 28,000 colleagues here at Wynn Resorts for delivering yet another record quarter. In this case, the best second quarter EBITDAR in the history of the company at $572 million. record quarters like this one further strengthen our conviction when deploying capital, whether through CapEx or share repurchases like those we executed in the second quarter and into the third quarter.\r\n Wynn Las Vegas delivered $230 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a second quarter record and up 3% year-on-year on yet another very difficult comp, taking trailing 12-month EBITDAR to nearly $970 million. The quarter was led by 16% growth in hotel revenue along with 8% growth in slot handle and healthy table drop in the casino. Wynn Las Vegas continues to have the top-performing team here in Vegas. More recently, demand has remained healthy in 3Q with RevPAR up and slot handle broadly in line year-on-year during July, despite this year having two fewer weekend days.\r\n Turning to Boston. Encore generated $62 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. Lower than normal table hold masked what was actually a strong quarter across the property with record slot handle, strong table drop and record RevPAR in the hotel. More recently, demand has remained healthy through July with table drops, slot handle and RevPAR all up on a tough year-on-year comp.\r\n Turning to Macau. We generated $280 million of EBITDAR in the second quarter on slightly lower market share than we have experienced over the previous several quarters and slightly lower mass hold quarter-over-quarter. There has been a lot of chatter in the market about the elevated promotional environment in Macau with concessionaires jockeying for market share.\r\n Of course, while we are active every day in the hand-to-hand combat for market share, you can't take market share to the bank, and thus, we have remained -- we have continued to remain disciplined in our OpEx and player reinvestment levels, highlighted by our strong EBITDAR margin in the quarter, which was 250 basis points above 2Q 2019. We've seen this dynamic before, and we remain confident that our market-leading product and service levels position us well to compete effectively in the long term.\r\n To that end, we were encouraged that our GGR market share moved back to our expected range in July, supported by strong mass table drop and 99% hotel occupancy during the month. Wynn Macau's long-term outlook remains very bright.\r\n On the development front, we continue to elevate our product offering in Macau through new and innovative food and beverage concepts and unique programming. We also continue to advance construction work on our second major concession-related project, our destination food hall, which we expect to open in 2025.\r\n Turning to our Wynn Al Marjan Island development in the UAE. I just returned from several weeks in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah. Construction is rapidly progressing on the project with work now approaching the 15th floor of the hotel. The building now stands just over 90 meters, which is already the tallest building in the Emirate.\r\n During the second quarter, we contributed $357 million of equity to our UAE joint venture. This transaction included the purchase of our 40% pro rata share of all 155 acres of Island Three, the island on which Wynn Al Marjan sits. As a result, our joint venture now owns not only the land under Wynn Al Marjan, but also 70-plus acres of land for potential future development on the Island. Of course, we have banked land before in the US and Macau, and we are confident that acquiring this sizable Marjan land bank will prove valuable over the long term.\r\n As I have noted before, I believe the UAE is the most exciting new market for our industry in decades and our confidence in the demand and EBITDAR potential of Wynn Al Marjan continues to grow. We also made meaningful progress during the quarter on the debt financing for the project and expect that we will finalize that financing later in 2024. I remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. We have the best assets in the world's premier gaming markets. We also have an exciting high ROI development project in the UAE well underway, a development opportunity that is unique in our industry. And we are exploring potential greenfield opportunities in attractive gateway cities like New York and Bangkok.\r\n Meanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as free cash flow grows, allowing us to increase the return of capital to shareholders through the recurring dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Our best days lie ahead. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nThank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $230.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $628.7 million of operating revenue during the quarter, delivering an EBITDAR margin of 36.6%. Lower-than-normal table games hold negatively impacted EBITDAR by around $5 million in Q2. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day was $4.2 million in Q2 compared to $3.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to union-related payroll increases, along with higher variable costs due to increased volumes across the business.\r\n Turning to Boston, we generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $62.1 million on revenue of $212.6 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29.2%. As Craig alluded to, our table game hold was below normal during the quarter. And if we normalize hold in both periods, EBITDAR would have increased approximately 2% year on year. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side with OpEx per day of $1.15 million, flat year-on-year and down sequentially. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience.\r\n Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $280.4 million in the quarter on $885.3 million of operating revenue. Hold was a mixed bag in the quarter as higher than normal hold at Palace was more than offset by lower than normal hold at Wynn Macau, particularly in our mass table business. All in, we estimate hold negatively impacted EBITDAR at the combined properties by around $3 million during the quarter. EBITDAR margin was 31.7% in the quarter, an increase of 250 basis points relative to Q2 2019. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.5 million per day in Q2, a decrease of 19% compared to $3.2 million in Q2 2019 and down 3% on a sequential basis.\r\n The team has done a great job of staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted in the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025.\r\n Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of over $3.9 billion as of June 30. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and $1.7 billion in the US. During the quarter, we continued to reduce gross debt, repaying approximately $170 million on our bank facilities, and we have now reduced company-wide gross debt by more than $1.1 billion over the past year.\r\n The combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally with our properties generating nearly $2.4 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDAR, together with our robust cash position creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4 times. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders in both the US and Macau. To that end, the Wynn Resorts Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on August 30, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2024.\r\n We also opportunistically repurchased approximately 741,000 shares for $68 million during the quarter. Similarly, in June, Wynn Macau paid a dividend of $0.075 per share or USD 50 million, highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $94 million, primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business.\r\n Additionally, as Craig noted, we contributed $356.5 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island project during the quarter, bringing our total equity contribution to date to $514.4 million, split approximately $300 million for Wynn Al Marjan and a little over $200 million for the Marjan land bank and related infrastructure. We estimate our remaining 40% pro rata share of the required equity is approximately $900 million, fully loaded to capitalized interest, fees and certain improvements on the island.\r\n Importantly, as Craig noted, we've also made meaningful progress on the debt financing for the project with significant interest from a diverse group of banks, both locally and the region as well as internationally. We expect the financing will be completed later this year, and we will update you in due course. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Carlo Santarelli, Deutsche Bank.\n\nCarlo Santarelli\n\nThank you, good afternoon, everybody. Craig, you spoke a little bit about Las Vegas, the comfort you're seeing, the trends in July, acknowledging, obviously, August booking window short, September, some group on the books and fourth quarter, probably very limited visibility at this point outside of the group bookings. How would you characterize kind of the back half of the year? And could you talk a little bit about that group footprint that's already in place?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure, Carlo. I'll start, and then I'll ask Brian to talk a bit about group in Q3, Q4. Yeah, I noticed subsequent to one of our peers reporting the other day that there were some thoughts around Q4, some concerns around Q4. As you said, actually, the booking window is relatively short other than for group and then certain special events, F1 in particular. And so we don't -- we're not seeing anything of concern per se with respect to Q4. F1 specifically, which I know was mentioned extensively again on a peer's call, F1, there really top-notch operators. And unlike last year, when they heavily marketed throughout the year, they just started their big marketing push for the race this month, August. So I'm sure the race will be well executed.\r\n Our experience during last year's F1 and more recently during the Super Bowl tells us that we will be the place to see and be seen during the race. And so we're confident that we'll do just fine and get more than our fair share. Brian, group in Q3 and Q4? And any other thoughts on the back half of the year?\n\nBrian Gullbrants\n\nSure. Thanks, Greg. Carlo, Q3 continues to pace very well. It's solid. August and September look even better than July. And when we look to Q4, pacing well for the year will be the best year we've ever had in group and convention and '25 seems to be pacing actually ahead of that, all with strong ADR growth. So the sales team has done a phenomenal job, and our yield management team and revenue management continues to yield because of that strong base, so it helps all segments. So I think we're in solid shape, and we're encouraged by what we're seeing.\n\nCarlo Santarelli\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brian. And then, Craig, if I could ask a follow-up. You guys have repurchased year-to-date as of [6/30]. It looks like about $80 million of stock. I think you said $68 million in the quarter in the release. When you look at kind of current valuations looked at many different ways, but obviously, just about any way you cut it, the embedded implied valuation for the domestic assets at the very least is seemingly compelling from a buyback perspective, acknowledging there is significant capital going out the door related to UAE. How do you think about kind of perhaps accelerating some of the buyback activity?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nThanks, Carlo. Well, as you know, you've followed the company for a long time. We're not programmatic buyers of the stock, and we tend to buy back more when it is particularly cheap. So you're right to that end, we did purchase in the quarter, and we continued to purchase into July and actually the first few days of August, actually. We still have some $365 million of capacity under the Board authorization. We're really balancing all of our liquidities needs between capital deployment for growth, the UAE, potentially other greenfield markets, delevering slightly and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Fortunately, we're in a position to do all of that. And so as you rightly know, it's really a question of quantum and we'll continue to be opportunistic about it.\n\nCarlo Santarelli\n\nThanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nJoe Greff, JPMorgan.\n\nJoe Greff\n\nHey Craig, earlier, you had mentioned that you saw a nice rebound in market share in July. That was more of a directional comment than one with any specific numbers associated with that. Would you say that the share is back to the GGR share that you saw in the 1Q? Or is it really more approaching that level? And then related to that, Craig, are you seeing in July and August to date, as you're seeing GGR share improve, are you seeing an associated lift in the non-gaming revenues as well?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nThanks, Joe. Well, to your second question first, there's always a relationship given the way that the gap requires you to book rooms revenue associated with the casino. There's always a relationship between casino volumes, quality of customers and room rates. With respect to retail, the retail component of nongaming, I think the situation with respect to luxury retail in China is hopefully well understood. I think you've seen a lot of the large luxury retailers come out and make commentary on the topic. And of course, Macau and Hong Kong are not immune. I think what we've experienced is pretty consistent with our peers who have comparable retail footprints.\r\n To the first question that you raised, we're not going to provide specific numbers, but we were pleased with the bounce back in July. And as you know, market share can bounce around here and there over the course of any given year or any given quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you can't take market share to the bank. So what we don't want to do is completely blow out our reinvestment levels and pursue a market share that doesn't drive meaningful flow-through. So we are being disciplined with respect to reinvestment and being aggressive in terms of going out and getting business.\n\nJoe Greff\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. And then with respect to your UAE project, I heard all the things that you said, including the timeline for completing the debt financing. When do you think we'll actually have specific regulations out there and specifically when you get a license? I know it's been a while now.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. Thanks, Joe. Well, first of all, we were delighted with the public announcement of the GCGRA, the federal regulatory body for gaming. If you -- for, I guess, you and everybody else on the call, if you haven't, take a look at their website, we encourage you to do that. The members of that body are some of the luminaries of the industry and very, very experienced regulators. The establishment of the GCGRA creates hopefully creates incremental clarity for investors and financing sources. It certainly has on the financing -- on the bank financing side.\r\n And then you'll also note that they recently awarded a lottery license for the UAE, and I think that, that hopefully again, gives folks comfort. I assume that they will be moving forward next to the next step in our licensure. I don't have a specific timeline for you, but you can see all the momentum that's happening there.\n\nJoe Greff\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nShaun Kelley, Bank of America.\n\nShaun Kelley\n\nHi good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Craig or (inaudible) right for -- one thing we've been watching in the data is on the visitation front into Macau. In the second quarter, in particular, these are market-wide stats, it looks like it sort of fell a little bit below trend line and a little bit below the pace of recovery we had been seeing in prior quarters. I'm curious, do you see something similar in volumes to the property? Perhaps you probably see it maybe it would be a little bit more acute at the Peninsula. Appreciate base math isn't really necessarily the pond that you went in, but just kind of what are you seeing on that visitation front? And have some of those stresses or factors improved at all in July so far, early August or vice versa as it deteriorated at all? Thank you.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nYeah. Shaun. Yeah, I'm sure you saw the news flow with respect to -- it was nearly a single day, but with respect to the recent visitation record, you're right. We don't really swim in that pond. It's not about the number of bodies, it's about the quality of the bodies. You're also correct that if we had to pick one of the two properties that was more exposed to that, it would be downtown, and I can't say that, that was a meaningful -- that had a meaningful impact rather during the second quarter. It was really about share. We have to fight for share every day. That's what we need to do. So I don't -- we don't really watch visitation numbers and think about the broader impact on our business because, again, for us, it's about who's there, not how many are there.\n\nShaun Kelley\n\nGreat. And then just maybe as a follow-up, just on the -- on the spend per visit. Have you seen any changes in patterns again outside of maybe the luxury piece, which you called out earlier. Just anything sort of else of note behaviorally for the customers that did come. And obviously, they're -- maybe they're looking forward demanding a little bit more on the promotional reinvestment front, but just anything behaviorally or across different status levels, base mass versus premium massive note?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nNo. There's a lot of crosscurrents happening in the economy there. So we watch that very closely. And as we've seen in this cycle and in previous cycles, the gaming business has been pretty resilient. You'll note the comment that I made to the previous caller, with respect to retail. And I think you see that in the retail revenue and the retail revenue trends. But with respect to gaming, we don't see that. What we see is a pretty competitive environment for market share. And so we have to be competitive and get our fair share.\n\nShaun Kelley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDan Politzer, Wells Fargo.\n\nDan Politzer\n\nHey good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First on Macau, up until this quarter, your share has been pretty stable. I mean is your sense that as GGRs slowed or decelerated in Macau that the promotional environment has maybe stepped up a notch. And is it -- if so, is it multiple operators, a single operator Cotai Peninsula? Any additional color would be helpful.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. Well, with the caveat that Macau has always been and always will be an extremely competitive market. I'm not going to comment on specific promotional activity by others in the market. But I can tell you that our reinvestment in any given quarter could move up or down 50 basis points, 75 basis points, something like that based on what we're trying to achieve. But the core of our competitive strength will always be product and service.\n\nDan Politzer\n\nGot it. And then in terms of Las Vegas, it seems like the Sphere calendar of events has really started to fill out nicely. To what extent are you seeing an uplift there from that customer base just given your proximity to that venue?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nWell, I would say, anecdotally, it is impactful. I say anecdotally because we have so much going on, both in terms of internally generated events and programming that we're doing here and citywide events that are happening or events that are happening at other properties. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done some $970 million in EBITDAR out of in Las Vegas over the trailing 12 months. That's a real credit to the team here.\r\n So every little bit counts, I can't isolate any particular event short of, of course, the major events like F1, Super Bowl, things like that. And as I said on the previous call, we're delighted to have the Sphere and their team as neighbors. We love innovators. We love people that do things at the cutting edge and drive high-quality visitation.\n\nDan Politzer\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nStephen Grambling, Morgan Stanley.\n\nStephen Grambling\n\nThank you. I guess sticking with Vegas, Craig, you've been in and around the industry for -- and seen multiple cycles. I guess with all the concerns mounting over the consumer, what are you on watch for in your business as perhaps a leading indicator? And how do you think about the operating leverage of the business now versus history in terms of being able to flex if the market changes?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nYeah, good question. Thank you. What do you look for? High-end wine sales, club sales, I mean we can go all day. I mean we can look at the -- we can get into the weeds and talk about individual unit metrics I think you would be looking at if you were on the inside of our business, we haven't seen that yet as we've been saying now for -- I think we've been answering questions around the impending performance of the business for over two years. So we haven't seen that yet, but we're watching very, very closely to see how the consumer is behaving both in the moment and as they book to stay with us.\r\n What can we do to the extent that the consumer was to soften a little bit. I think -- and we've talked about this on calls previously as well. I mean we lived through a zero-revenue environment for several months in a seriously compressed revenue environment for many months after that as we went through COVID and the aftermath of COVID. That team is still here. Still doing a tremendous job, and we have every playbook under the sun. We've learned how to run this business far differently than we were able to pre-COVID, which is part of the reason that we have been running such incredibly healthy margins, and we're able to fade things like the union increases the way that we have. So we have a playbook for every possible situation, but we haven't seen any of those situations emerge yet.\n\nStephen Grambling\n\nAnd perhaps as an unrelated follow-up. You mentioned the progress made in the UAE. There also looks like there's been some progress in Thailand. I guess, what are your latest thoughts on that market? Would that be something that you'd pursue? Or do you more likely to pursue out of the Hong Kong entity? Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nYeah, we would pursue it out of Wynn Resorts, out of the US listed entity. It's still early days. You're right, there has been progress, and it's encouraging to see. And it seems as though the legislators in Thailand really want to get this moving, which is great. We need to see more details on the regulatory and licensing structures. But the market is an attractive market, and it's probably conducive to meaningful investment, pending again a deeper understanding of the regulatory and licensing structure. You have amazing tourism infrastructure. You have a really strong service culture and a favorable operating expense structure available in that market. So we're continuing to monitor the process very, very closely, and we're active on the ground there.\n\nStephen Grambling\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nFor sure.\n\nOperator\n\nDavid Katz, Jefferies.\n\nDavid Katz\n\nHi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the capital allocation discussion, specifically the buyback, if I may. Obviously, there's wide-ranging views about how to execute those. But with you getting your company getting to that 4 times leverage, do you think about a target leverage range, separate apart from projects? And if you could go just a little further on the philosophy around opportunistic versus programmatic in terms of the buybacks for some insight because I think the arguments are valid that your stock may be cheap at $100, right, or $76 or wherever it may be. Just curious. Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. The second portion of your question first. We don't target -- we don't have target leverage levels because we will lever in place EBITDAR to develop new projects. But we feel very good with where we are now. There's a WACC minimization question that needs to be answered. And we're probably in that zone at the leverage level that we're at today.\r\n With respect to buybacks, it's a little bit like capital deployment. We think about these things in 5 and 10-year increments. So -- and over 5 or 10 years, there's going to be times when the stock is expensive. There's going to be times when the stock is fairly priced, right, and there's going to be times when the stock is cheap.\r\n And so what we need to do is continuously decapitalize in an appropriate manner. And of course, we will consider whatever the implied valuation is in the equity at any given point in time, and we will act accordingly. But if we're growing the company by putting capital in the ground, we're returning to capital to shareholders through the dividends, and we are decapitalizing the business, and we're doing the right thing for those who have a long-term view on our business, and those are the people that we care about.\n\nDavid Katz\n\nThat's perfect. Thank you very much.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nRobin Farley, UBS.\n\nRobin Farley\n\nHey thanks. Macau question and a Vegas question. For Macau, it seems like the use of smart tables has impacted market share in Macau pretty meaningfully. If you could kind of remind us where you are with implementing those and maybe a timeframe for if there's kind of a learning curve for several quarters or something and kind of where you are with that? And then I have a Vegas question. Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure, Robin. Smart tables have a few -- they've been around for a long time, but they've really just now reached a point from a technical soundness perspective and capability perspective where they could be really impactful. So of course, they have implications on positive implications on game security. They have some implications on OpEx. But the important aspect of them is, in fact, the data and the ability to ingest and act on the data, which can drive better reinvestment decisions, which I think is at the core of what you mentioned when you say that it impacts market share.\r\n We're -- we've had a test bank of smart tables for a while now, and we're now moving to full rollout. We've made a ton of investments in the areas of analytics and data science over the course of the past several years. And I think we'll be in a position relatively quickly to both ingest and interpret and act on that data subsequent to roll out.\n\nRobin Farley\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you. And then just on Vegas. You talked about some of the expenses that (inaudible) have kind of hurt some of the EBITDAR flow through. If you could just remind us when that will sort of be fully anniversaried. And then I don't know if there's anything you'd call out about comping the Super Bowl in Q1. Anything you could call out there? Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. We lapped the union increases a couple of days ago. So July was the last month that we were still dealing with difficult year-over-year comparables on those. And with respect to Q1, I don't have a view for you yet, to be perfectly honest. I mean, we -- you know how we operate. We aggressively manage revenue, and we aggressively manage expenses, and we'll do that throughout Q1, but what the impact of not having the Super Bowl this year will be and what that will mean to the numbers? I don't have any guidance for you yet.\n\nRobin Farley\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nBrandt Montour, Barclays.\n\nBrandt Montour\n\nThank you for the question. Good afternoon and good evening, everybody. So first one on UAE. I know it's a little early maybe to start talking about or fleshing out a go-to-market strategy. I'm curious just given that the location of the property, I know that your database, I'm sure, is global in nature. But I'm assuming that Europe would probably be the largest source market where you're the least exposed from a physical footprint standpoint. Maybe you could just flesh out where you think your customers are going to come from mainly out of the gate and where you plan to market the most out of the gate?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. I try to figure out how to condense an hours' worth of content into a response. But so the way I think about it is like this. There is not a proper integrated resort on really that half of the planet, okay? So the closest is going to be in Asia, right, Singapore or Macau. So we have this unique asset. We have a very, very robust population that is within an eight-hour flight of that asset. This is a part of the world where people are accustomed to flying longer distances in order to holiday and to visit. You have 86 million airlifts coming into the Dubai Airport, we're about 55 minutes via one of three six-lane highways from the Dubai airport. In fact, because of traffic, it's shorter to get to us than it is to get to the major areas within Dubai.\r\n And then you have 10 million people locally, 9 million of whom are not Emirati and therefore, are able to play. So -- and if you compare that to Boston, if you compare that to New York City, you can see that that's a pretty favorable number. So we have a very robust go-to-market plan. We're not going to talk about it publicly, but we will be ready when the door is open.\r\n And I would say to your comment on Europe, yes, Europe is an important market for the UAE in general. But don't forget India. India is a huge market for this part of the world. There's a lot of folks there. There's a lot of wealth in India, and that's going to be an important market. And there are other parts of Asia that are big markets for the UAE as well. So it's an exciting project. I think the catchment area is probably larger than any other project that we have done, maybe akin to Vegas. If you take into account the fact that Europe's population is pretty substantial and the international airlift is incredibly strong.\n\nBrandt Montour\n\nThanks for that. That was a lot of information in a short amount of time. I appreciate that. And then my second question is just on Macau and apologies for the short-term question. But when your comments on July bouncing back in market share, is that -- do you think that's more because the competitive environment may have stabilized a little bit sequentially? Or is it just more related to the July visitation coming back and allowing sort of everything to cool off a little bit from the competitive standpoint?\n\nCraig Billings\n\nNo. Well, first of all, market share can bounce and three people can come in and change your market share on any given day. That's the nature of the business, right? Particularly when you're operating at the high end. So market share can bounce around. I think we are in a constant process of evaluating and reevaluating not just the quantum of reinvestment that we will provide, but the form of that reinvestment, and we are targeting that reinvestment at very specific segments and subsegments of the market. And so we recognized what we needed to tweak from Q2 and from June, in particular, and we corrected it, and we went to market with it. And we -- like I said, we bounced back in July, which was good to see.\r\n Perfect. Thanks very much.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nThank you, Brandt. And Operator, the next question will be our last. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nChad Beynon, Macquarie.\n\nChad Beynon\n\nAfternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Craig, you highlighted just kind of the overall strength in Vegas, the $970 million. You guys are always out punching your weight in that market, and you still have additional space to expand the property or build something differently. So kind of going back to the capital allocation question, how are you thinking about Vegas long term as a market to grow your footprint and the returns in that market versus some of the other things that you've talked about on this call. Thanks.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. We will grow in Vegas. It's really a question of when, not if, and we will take advantage of the land bank that we have in Las Vegas. In terms of relative returns, I think the highest relative return that we can quantify now is absolutely in the UAE on Al Marjan Island. And as I mentioned, we just took down a land bank there as well. You can look at the history of gaming markets, Macau, in particular, and you can see the power of a land bank and the power of using that land bank and going to market relatively quickly. So that's top of mind for us.\r\n The other development opportunities that we have, most notably the potential in New York and the potential in Thailand, it's too early to say what the returns will be because we don't know what the tax rate will be. And obviously, that heavily inversely correlates to what the return on the project will be. And we won't do projects, vanity projects, if those vanity projects don't deliver appropriate returns relative to everything else that we have on our plate.\n\nChad Beynon\n\nThanks. And then secondly, just in terms of the different customers in your database, focusing on the US, I guess, mainly still in Vegas. Are you seeing any change in trends with your, I guess, your high end versus your ultra high end? Anything you're able to talk about? I know retail, you talked about in Macau is kind of moving with the market, but anything that you're seeing differently in the US with the different levels of upper end customers in your database.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure. Not really. So I talked about this a little bit on the last call. There is a bright side to the fact that purchasing power -- the purchasing power of the dollar today is the same as about $0.80 in June of 2019. We reprice our rooms every day. Our gaming customers' bank roles are in current dollars. Of course, our invested capital and our debt is in yesterday's dollars, which is a great setup. If you look at that $970 million of EBITDAR on our invested capital here. It's a very, very healthy return. That being said, we don't see it, and I wouldn't say that there's wide differentiation across the customer database. So again, and you referenced this, we focus on a very specific customer. Brian, anything you would add there?\n\nBrian Gullbrants\n\nYeah, I would say the highest end of the market continues to grow for us on the non-gaming side. And the team has done a phenomenal job in capturing that business and it's perfect for our brand, and that's where we sit and operate and do a great job. So it continues to grow.\n\nChad Beynon\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nSure.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe\n\nWell, thank you, Chad, and thank you, everyone. We'll now close the call. Thank you for your interest in Wynn Resorts, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\n\nCraig Billings\n\nThanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wynn Resorts (WYNN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.12 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.91 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -8.94%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this casino operator would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.59, delivering a surprise of 11.19%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nWynn , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $1.73 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.6 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nWynn shares have lost about 19.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Wynn?\n\nWhile Wynn has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Wynn: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.15 on $1.76 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.62 on $7.24 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Gaming is currently in the top 33% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, PlayAGS (AGS), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024.\n\nThis gaming industry supplier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +450%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nPlayAGS's revenues are expected to be $95.5 million, up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Misses Q2 Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Misses Q2 Revenue Estimates\n\nLuxury hotels and casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) missed analysts' expectations in Q2 CY2024, with revenue up 8.6% year on year to $1.73 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $1.12 per share, improving from its profit of $0.91 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Wynn Resorts? Find out in our full research report.\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) Q2 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $1.73 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.74 billion (small miss) Adj EBITDA: $571.7 million vs analyst estimates of $579.8 billion (1.4% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $1.12 vs analyst expectations of $1.19 (6.1% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 43.5%, down from 67.7% in the same quarter last year Adjusted EBITDA Margin: 25.7%, down from 27.4% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $8.17 billion\n\n\"Our second quarter results, including a new second quarter record for Adjusted Property EBITDAR, reflect continued strength throughout our business. I am incredibly proud of our teams in Las Vegas, Macau and Boston,\" said Craig Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts, Limited.\n\nFounded by the former Mirage Resorts CEO, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a global developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos, known for its luxurious properties and premium guest services.\n\nCasino Operator\n\nCasino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it\u2019s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand.\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones tend to grow for years. Unfortunately, Wynn Resorts's 1.2% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was weak. This shows it failed to expand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Wynn Resorts Total Revenue\n\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends and consumer preferences. Wynn Resorts's annualized revenue growth of 34.8% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand recently accelerated. Note that COVID hurt Wynn Resorts's business in 2020 and part of 2021, and it bounced back in a big way thereafter.\n\nWe can dig further into the company's revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Casino, Hotel, and Dining and Entertainment, which are 58.2%, 17.6%, and 16.2% of revenue. Over the last two years, Wynn Resorts's revenues in all three segments increased. Its Casino revenue (Poker, slots) averaged year-on-year growth of 67.9% while its Hotel (overnight bookings) and Dining and Entertainment (food, beverage, Wynn Interactive) revenues averaged 31.3% and 9.9%.\n\nThis quarter, Wynn Resorts's revenue grew 8.6% year on year to $1.73 billion, missing Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses\u2013everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It's also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes.\n\nWynn Resorts's operating margin has risen over the last year and averaged 12.6%. Its profitability was higher than the broader consumer discretionary sector, showing it did a decent job managing its expenses. Wynn Resorts Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q2, Wynn Resorts generated an operating profit margin of 15.6%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company's overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n\nKey Takeaways from Wynn Resorts's Q2 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many strong positives in these results. Its adjusted EBITDA and EPS both missed and its Hotel segment revenue fell short of Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. Despite this, the stock traded up 2.8% to $78.40 immediately following the results.\n\nSo should you invest in Wynn Resorts right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

Please contact our investor relations office at 702-770-7555 or at investorrelations@wynnresorts.com, to obtain access to such financial information.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements regarding operating trends and future results of operations. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, reductions in discretionary consumer spending, adverse macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of disposable consumer income and wealth, changes in interest rates, inflation, a decline in general economic activity or recession in the U.S. and/or global economies, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political conditions, adverse tourism trends, travel disruptions caused by events outside of our control, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction and regulatory risks associated with current and future projects (including Wynn Al Marjan Island), cybersecurity risk and our leverage and ability to meet our debt service obligations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n(1) \"Adjusted Property EBITDAR\" is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\n\n(2) \"Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited\" is net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and foreign currency remeasurement and other, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes calculated using the specific tax treatment applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDAR, and (iii) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDAR.\n\nWYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended

        "content": "Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN is scheduled to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug 6, 2024, after the closing bell. In the previous quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 11.2%.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.23 per share, indicating a surge of 35.2% from 91 cents in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.75 billion, implying an increase of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nLet's look at how things might have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nWynn Resorts\u2019 second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from increased visitor numbers and demand, especially in Las Vegas and Macau, along with higher gaming volumes as well as increased hotel occupancy. The strong mass casino activity, high direct VIP turnover, robust luxury retail sales and increased hotel revenues are anticipated to have aided the company\u2019s performance in the quarter to be reported. We expect revenues from Macau operations to rise 10.7% year over year to $852.2 million.\r\n\r\nIncreased visitation in the Las Vegas market and strong contributions from food and beverage and rooms are likely to have supported the company\u2019s performance. Per our model, revenues from Las Vegas operations are expected to rise 6.7% year over year to $616.6 million.\r\n\r\nStrong contributions from Encore Boston Harbor might have aided the company\u2019s top line. The emphasis on development projects (including incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities) and increased sign-ups (to the Wynn Rewards loyalty program) have been a catalyst for WYNN. The momentum is expected to have driven the top-line growth. We expect revenues from Encore Boston Harbor to rise 4% year over year to $230.8 million in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges, such as a softer macroeconomic environment in China and high costs, are likely to have negatively impacted the company\u2019s performance. Our model predicts total operating expenses to increase 9.2% to $1,469.4 million.\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this time around.

The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $559.70 million.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Room occupancy rate - Wynn Las Vegas' should come in at 90.7%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 90.6% in the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Average daily room rate - Wynn Las Vegas' reaching $499.91. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $462 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Slot Machine Handle - Las Vegas Operations' will reach $1.55 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $1.52 billion.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Average Number of Table Games - Macau Operations - Wynn Palace - Mass market' at 235.

        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Playtika Holding (PLTK) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 7, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis mobile game developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $642.15 million, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Playtika?\n\nFor Playtika, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.09%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Playtika will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Playtika would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.15, delivering no surprise.\n\nThe company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nPlaytika doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Gaming industry, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.23 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +35.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.75 billion, up 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Wynn has been revised 2.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.33%.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Wynn will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN): One of Ken Fisher\u2019s Top Growth Stock Picks Right Now",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Ken Fisher\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nGrowth is the holy grail of investing. After all, equities attract investors because they are return driven securities, and securities that deliver growth often produce the strongest returns. Growth, in stock valuation, comes in several flavors. The most commonly analyzed metric is share price growth, which evaluates the percentage change in the share price over a time period.\n\nOther growth valuations come through earnings growth or revenue growth. Among these, earnings is the more commonly evaluated metric as it determines the profitability of a company. These profits are key for growth stocks since the post net income 'money' on a firm's income statement is either paid out in the form of dividends or reinvested in growth if it isn't accounted for as retained earnings. The market generally prices stocks that are expected to aggressively grow in the future high compared to their earnings in the form of the P/E ratio.\n\nThe other ratio for evaluating growth stocks is the price to sales or P/S ratio. And this is where Ken Fisher enters the conversation. Fisher is one of the richest people in the world, with estimates from Forbes Magazine showing that his net worth stood at $11.2 billion as of July 2024. At the heart of Fisher's riches is his investment fund Fisher Investments. The total value of the fund's 13F holdings as reflected by its SEC filings for the first quarter of 2024 is $214 billion according to Insider Monkey's research. This makes Fisher Investments one of the biggest financial firms in the world, and its investment approach as evidenced by some of the biggest stakes in the filings is characterized by investing in high growth technology companies.\n\nFisher started his firm in 1979 and focused on gaining an early foothold on market participants by sifting out information that was not widely available to investors. On the quantitative front, the P/S ratio was also quite critical to his approach and we'll get to that in a bit. Over the next two decades, his firm would focus on investing in pure play US equities, global equities, and exUS or foreign equities. The firm would focus its investment products towards high net worth individuals in the 1990s, and from 2000 onwards, it would expand its presence in the UK, Canada, and Germany. Fisher Investments now has 15 offices in 16 countries and more than a hundred thousand clients worldwide as of July 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting gears to focus on the firm's performance, data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shows that data for 76 funds managed by Fisher Investments is available. Within these, the fund that invests for retirement plans has gained 19.18% year to date and 18.77% over the past year. Compared to the benchmark S&P index, the year to date performance is two percentage points higher while the 12 month performance lags the index by three percentage points. Another fund that targets US equities irrespective of capitalization is up by 24% over the past twelve months to lead the benchmark by three percentage points. In daily trailing total returns, this fund has delivered 14.39% over the past six months to lead benchmark US large cap equity returns of 11.36% by three percentage points.\n\nSafe to say, Fisher's strategies and secret sauce seem to be working. This then leads us to ask, what might they be? Well, in the 70s when Fisher was starting Fisher Investments, he started to focus on evaluating a firm's market valuation relative to its revenue through the P/S ratio. This culminated in his seminal article in the American Association of Individual Investors. (AAII) in 1984. This paper highlighted Fisher's conviction of a solid approach to sift out growth stocks, and his research showed that stocks with low price to sales ratios tended to do rather well as they were unpopular and any good news \"translates directly into higher stock prices.\" He compared the stocks with the lowest 25% price to sales and price to earnings ratio to demonstrate that the seven and nine stocks with the lowest price to sales ratios delivered 64.57% and 56.11% in respective returns while the nine lowest P/E stocks delivered 28.67% in returns. During the same time, the Dow posted a gain of 20.3%.\n\nSince multiples that use growth rates are typically used to value growth stocks, particularly those that are unprofitable, they are quite sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and particularly inflation and high interest rates. Another popular revenue based growth stock valuation metric is the Enterprise Value/Revenue ratio and it is popular for valuing software as a service (SaaS) stocks. After the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Fed rapidly cut interest rates to stimulate the economy and this translated well for EV/Revenue. Before the rate cuts, the median EV/Revenue for publicly traded SaaS stocks was 11 and after the cuts, it soared and nearly doubled to sit at 20 in 2021.\n\nSimilarly, the interest rate hikes of 2022 and high inflation that led to tight business budgets didn't fare well for EV/Revenue. Since high interest rates also make it difficult for firms to finance their business operations, and high inflation leads to rising costs, SaaS firms face twice the impact in the form of lower revenue. This is also translated into their EV/Revenue multiples, as for the last 18 months, the median multiple was 7 which is at a multi year low. The lower multiples are accompanied by dropping growth rates, as while the pre pandemic median revenue growth rate of SaaS companies was 30% and accelerated to 33% during the pandemic, it has since dropped and is hovering around 17%.\n\nSo, as growth slows down and multiples struggle, it might be wise to see what the guru of growth Ken Fisher is doing. We've done so today so read more below.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Ken Fisher's top revenue growth stocks, we scanned Fisher Investments' Q1 2024 SEC filings and ranked the top 160 holdings by their three year annualized revenue growth. Out of these, the top ten Ken Fisher stocks with the highest revenue growth were chosen.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAerial view of a luxury hotel tower surrounded by lush green landscaping.\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 42\n\n3 Yr Revenue Growth: 46.07%\n\nFisher Investments' Q1 2024 Stake: $415 million\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a diversified casino company that operates properties in Las Vegas and Macao. Along with Vegas, the firm is also expanding its presence in Boston by expanding its current Boston Harbor resort and in New York by applying for a gaming license. Additionally, Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) also has its eyes set on the UAE, which is one of the world's biggest tourism destinations. The firm aims to build a 1,500 room hotel and an accompanying casino, which shows that it has learned from the lessons of the coronavirus that impacted its business heavily due to restrictions in China. At the same time, even though Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is expanding its global footprint, it relies heavily on China for its revenue. On this front, several headwinds including lax cost control, lower holiday spending, and strict regulations for money transfers can prove to be headwinds for the firm as they reduce the flow of funds in the region.\n\nCommenting on the Macao expenditures, here's what Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)'s management had to say during the Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n\"We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about OpEx and how we\u2019ve been very disciplined in managing it and how we\u2019ve been able to accommodate the non-gaming OpEx that we have to spend to meet our concession commitments. So we\u2019ve been really disciplined. We had OpEx per day of $2.63 million in Q1. So it\u2019s still well below Q1 \u201919 levels, and it\u2019s only up 3% sequentially. It was a big Q in terms of what we call tentpole events. And it\u2019s \u2014 obviously, the OpEx increase is well below the 10% we\u2019ve had sequentially in operating revenue. So we had \u2014 we were really pleased with the flow-through there. Going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to be really disciplined around OpEx. We have good line of sight to the events calendar and how we\u2019ll continue to incorporate that.\n\nSo as we have our EBITDA margin at both properties above Q1 \u201919 levels and our OpEx were well controlled, we really expect revenue mix to be the key driver of margins going forward. We\u2019re going to have some quarter-to-quarter variation as we see different events on the calendar, and we continue to roll out programming. But we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve managed to land with OpEx. And we see potential for some quarters to be slightly inside of that $2.63 million. And maybe in a bigger quarter, it might be slightly outside of that, but overall, we\u2019re in a good place.\"\n\nOverall WYNN ranks 6th on our list of Ken Fisher's top 10 growth stocks picks.

While we acknowledge the potential of WYNN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Winners And Losers Of Q1: PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) Vs The Rest Of The Casino Operator Stocks\n\nLooking back on casino operator stocks' Q1 earnings, we examine this quarter's best and worst performers, including PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) and its peers.\n\nCasino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it\u2019s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand.\n\nThe 9 casino operator stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.5%. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and casino operator stocks have held roughly steady amidst all this, with share prices up 2.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nPENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN)\n\nEstablished in 1982, PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) is a diversified American operator of casinos, sports betting, and entertainment venues.\n\nPENN Entertainment reported revenues of $1.61 billion, down 4% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 1.1%. Overall, it was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nJay Snowden, Chief Executive Officer and President, said: \u201cOur property level performance showed resilience this quarter, with stable trends continuing into April following portfolio-wide severe weather through mid-February. Meanwhile, ESPN BET continues to drive strong top of funnel demand due to the reach and affinity for the ESPN brand, which led to record online sports betting handle and iCasino gross gaming revenue in the quarter. However, Interactive segment results were negatively impacted primarily by unfavorable hold from major sporting events. We look forward to unveiling additional product enhancements and unique media integrations with ESPN ahead of the 2024 football season.

        "title": "3 Travel Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Revenge travel or the phenomenon of pent-up demand stemming from the COVID-19-related lockdowns may be a fading consumer behavior. But that doesn\u2019t mean travel stocks to buy have suddenly become irrelevant as an investment opportunity. No, if anything, investors may have a viable prospect for sustained growth on their hands.\n\nSure, people aren\u2019t rushing to get out of the home anymore. The worst of the pandemic is (probably) behind us. However, Covid-19 also sparked a reprioritization about what\u2019s really important. Put another way, people are realizing that life is short and it\u2019s the experiences that we enjoy with loved ones that truly matter. And consumer behavioral analytics reflect this shift in thinking.\n\nWhat\u2019s even better is that such a shift is materializing even under challenging economic circumstances. Therefore, it\u2019s possible this behavioral trend may have legs. With that in mind, below are three travel stocks investors should put on their watch list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSouthwest Airlines (LUV) An image of the side of a blue Southwest plane with a blue sky in the background. LUV stock\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom a charting perspective, discount airliner Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) doesn\u2019t seem all that attractive. In the past 52 weeks, it\u2019s down about 23%. Various headwinds and corporate bubbles contributed to an uneven share price performance. However, with households prioritizing their vacations in the post-Covid environment, LUV could be an intriguing proposition.\n\nFirst, the valuation appears attractive. Right now, LUV stock trades hands at 0.69X trailing-year revenue. Between the first quarter of 2023 and Q1 2024, this metric stood at 0.79X. Further, in Q2 of last year, LUV averaged a revenue multiple of 0.94X. The thinking here is that if the market can accept Southwest at 0.94X, the equity has room to grow.\n\nSecond, that\u2019s exactly what analysts are projecting. By the end of this year, experts believe that sales could rise 5.3% to $27.48 billion. Moreover, the high-side estimate calls for $28.39 billion, a sizable leap from last year\u2019s print of $26.09 billion. Therefore, Southwest is an intriguing idea for travel stocks to buy.\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) the Wynn resort in Las Vegas\n\nSource: Wangkun Jia / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the powerhouse names in the casino and resorts arena, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) should see a move higher if travel prioritization continues to inspire consumer spending habits. Now, it must be said that Wall Street isn\u2019t exactly sold on WYNN stock. Since the beginning of the year, shares have tumbled more than 10%. In the past 52 weeks, they\u2019re down almost 22%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it\u2019s also fair to point out that WYNN stock appears to have stabilized since late 2022. If so, the relative valuation of the company can be intriguing for speculators. Right now, WYNN trades at 1.39X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric stood at 2.38X. In Q1 of last year, it shot up to an average of 3.38X. Theoretically, then, the casino giant has much room to grow.\n\nAnalysts do believe in that growth. For fiscal 2024, they anticipate that the top line could expand by 12.2% to $7.33 billion. Moreover, the high-side estimate lands at $7.53 billion. It\u2019s one of the travel stocks to keep close tabs on.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Norwegian Pearl, a Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) ship, in the middle of the ocean\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis/shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under its namesake industry, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) makes an attractive case for travel stocks to buy. Generally speaking, cruises offer big bang for the buck. Further, many of these operators facilitate trips in international regions. That\u2019s good for American tourists, where the relative strength of the dollar enhances purchasing power.\n\nHowever, what made me look at NCLH stock relative to its top two competitors is the valuation. Right now, shares trade hands at 0.96X trailing-year sales. That\u2019s actually a discount to what investors saw in the past year at 1.16X. Further, in Q2 of last year, the average multiple soared to 1.49X. Again, if the market operates in an ebb-and-flow cycle, NCLH may have room to run.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe that revenue may hit $9.37 billion. If so, that would represent a 9.6% increase from last year\u2019s haul of $8.55 billion. Further, in fiscal 2025, sales may eclipse the $10 billion mark. Norwegian just might be contextually discounted.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)?",
        "content": "While Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$106 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$83.91. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Wynn Resorts' current trading price of US$84.92 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Wynn Resorts\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nIs Wynn Resorts Still Cheap?\n\nGreat news for investors \u2013 Wynn Resorts is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $131.11, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Wynn Resorts\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from Wynn Resorts? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Wynn Resorts, at least in the near future.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Although WYNN is currently undervalued, the negative outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to WYNN, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on WYNN for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, we recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. For example, Wynn Resorts has 4 warning signs (and 2 which are a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Wynn Resorts, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau and a rendering of the Wynn casino (Getty, Wynn, Illustration by Kevin Rebong for The Real Deal)\n\nRelated Companies and luxury hotel and casino giant Wynn Resorts aren\u2019t making any friends at the High Line.\n\nFriends of the High Line, a nonprofit that advocates for the preservation of the High Line and its use as a public open space, is rallying support to oppose development plans for the park that include building a casino, apartment tower, office building, public school and daycare, the New York Times reported.\n\nRelated and Wynn joined the race for a downstate casino license earlier this year with a $12 billion pitch for Hudson Yards also slated to deliver more than 1,500 apartments, a resort hotel, 2 million square feet of office space, a public school and day care.\n\nOpponents of the plan claim the development, which is slated to build three skyscrapers on the 13-acre stretch between West 30th and West 33rd streets, will block views of the city, create gusty winds and cast long shadows that could hurt local business.\n\nTheir biggest gripe is a plan to build a 200,000-square-foot, 20-story podium that would hold a casino and skyscraper with 1,750 hotel rooms. Friends of the High Line head Alan van Capelle told the Times it would be like having six Costco warehouses stacked on top of each other and \u201cwill gravely endanger the High Line experience.\u201d\n\nThe High Line generates $50 million a year in local spending, according to data the group commissioned from economic development and consulting firm HR&A.\n\nRelated told the Times it has made efforts to resolve objections to the plan by meeting with the High Line group and making \u201csubstantive changes\u201d to the plans, but the group did not express any further objections after those changes.\n\nIn defense of the plan, Related says there will still be almost six acres of public green space and points out the project will generate thousands of union jobs. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal told the outlet the group has had a relationship with Related, which has donated millions of dollars to the group since the park opened.\n\nRelated and Wynn need support to be able to move forward with the project. In order to obtain one of only three licenses in the state to run a full casino in the city, they need to win majority approval from a panel of six people chosen by elected officials.\n\nThe New York State Gaming Facility Location Board is overseeing the application process and expects to announce winning casino proposals by the end of 2025.\n\n-Christina Previte\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Real Deal.

        "content": "Unpacking Q1 Earnings: Monarch (NASDAQ:MCRI) In The Context Of Other Casino Operator Stocks\n\nWrapping up Q1 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the casino operator stocks, including Monarch (NASDAQ:MCRI) and its peers.\n\nCasino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it\u2019s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand.\n\nThe 9 casino operator stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.5%. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and while some of the casino operator stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 3.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nMonarch (NASDAQ:MCRI)\n\nEstablished in 1993, Monarch (NASDAQ:MCRI) operates luxury casinos and resorts, offering high-end gaming, dining, and hospitality experiences.\n\nMonarch reported revenues of $121.7 million, up 4.3% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 0.5%. It was a slower quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue and earnings estimates.\n\nCEO Comment John Farahi, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch, commented: \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024 net revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew to all-time first quarter records of $121.7 million and $38.5 million, respectively, and the EBITDA margin improved to 31.7% from 31.3% in the same period of the prior year.

        "title": "Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Shares Could Be 28% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nWynn Resorts' estimated fair value is US$129 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Wynn Resorts is estimated to be 28% undervalued based on current share price of US$93.14 The US$126 analyst price target for WYNN is 2.4% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nThe Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$1.03b US$1.12b US$791.0m US$936.0m US$1.31b US$1.38b US$1.44b US$1.50b US$1.55b US$1.60b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x2 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.45% Est @ 4.53% Est @ 3.88% Est @ 3.43% Est @ 3.12% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11%  US$933 US$917 US$583 US$623 US$788 US$750 US$709 US$665 US$621 US$579\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.2b\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$1.6b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (11%\u2013 2.4%) = US$20b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$20b\u00f7 ( 1 + 11%)10= US$7.1b\n\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$14b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$93.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Wynn Resorts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.810. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nStrength\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nInterest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Wynn Resorts, we've compiled three additional elements you should further examine:\n\nRisks: Take risks, for example - Wynn Resorts has  4 warning signs  (and 2 which are concerning)  we think you should know about.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Wynn has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nWynn is part of the Zacks Gaming industry.

        "title": "Don't Bet on this Casino Stock to Recover in June",
        "content": "Shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) are a ways away from their April 4, nearly 52-week high of $110.38. In fact, WYNN is 1.1% lower at 93.84 at last glance, now down 7.9% this quarter and pulling back to its year-to-date breakeven level. What's more, a bout of seasonality is looming that could send Wynn Resorts stock lower still. WYNN Chart June 032024\n\nAccording to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Wynn Resorts is the third worst stock on the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to own in June, looking back over the past 10 years. The shares averaged a loss of 3.1% for the month over the last decade, and finished the month lower seven times. Worst SPX Stock June 032024\n\nAs for the brokerage bunch, there's plenty of optimism to be unwound. Of the 14 analysts in coverage, 10 recommend a \"strong buy\" rating. Plus, WYNN is ripe for a round of price adjustments, given the 12-month consensus price target of $124.935 is a 32.7% premium to current levels.\n\nA shift in the options pits could also weigh on the security. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), Wynn Resorts stock sports a 50-day call/put volume ratio of 5.89, which ranks higher than 98% of readings from the past 12 months.\n\nOptions look to be an attractive route to go when weighing in on the stock. Specifically, the equity\u2019s Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 25% ranks in the low 7th percentile of the last 12 months. What's more, its Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS)\u00a0is incredibly low right now, sitting at 9 out of 100. In simpler terms, the security is a prime selling candidate.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wynn Resorts upgraded, PayPal initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nSeaport Research upgraded Wynn Resorts(WYNN) to Buy from Neutral with a $116 price target. The stock's 9% decline since mid-April is unwarranted, with Wynn having delivered strong Q1 results in Macau and showed continued resilience in Las Vegas, the analyst tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan upgraded NetApp(NTAP) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $125, up from $95, following the fiscal Q4 report. The firm says its concerns around gross margin headwinds from a backdrop of rising memory prices has not transpired with the company \"executing robustly\" to manage the headwinds through pre-buy of memory while driving a richer portfolio mix in relation to higher margin all-flash drives. Wolfe Research upgraded Fifth Third(FITB) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $43 price target. The firm says the bank is a \"stable operator\" that will \"block and tackle its way\" to generating the greatest alpha in the regional space over the next 12 months. Piper Sandler last night double upgraded Independent Bank(IBTX) to Overweight from Underweight with a price target of $58, up from $38, to align with the 0.60 exchange ratio on its $98 price target for South State (SSB). Selling to South State should expedite the valuation creation recovery for Independent Bank shareholders and should deliver outsized returns for the legacy owners, the firm says. UBS upgraded Bilibili(BILI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $18, up from $11.90. The company's Q1 results brought \"robust\" advertising progress and a stabilizing game business, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nWells Fargo downgraded Marathon Oil(MRO) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $29, down from $38, after the company entered into a agreement pursuant to which ConocoPhillips (COP) will acquire it in an all-stock transaction. Keefe Bruyette downgraded ConnectOne Bancorp(CNOB) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $22, down from $24. The bank retains a fairly high commercial real estate concentration ratio at 442% of total capital, which could limit valuation upside relative to peers over the medium term as it will likely take a couple years for broader investor concerns regarding the uncertainty of future CRE credit performance to be resolved, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Keefe Bruyette downgraded Valley National(VLY) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $8, down from $12, following a change in analyst coverage. The firm reduced estimates to reflect a more conservative net interest income and credit outlook. Citi downgraded Calliditas Therapeutics(CALT) to Neutral from Buy with a $39 price target after Asahi Kasei (AHKSY) announced an agreement to acquire Calliditas for about $39 per ADS or about $1.1B. Johnson Rice downgraded Cactus(WHD) to Accumulate from Buy with a $61 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nNew Street initiated coverage of PayPal(PYPL) with a Buy rating and $80 price target. The analyst says new CEO Alex Chriss is pivoting PayPal toward value. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Sarepta(SRPT) with an Overweight rating and $157 price target. The analyst likes the prospects for Elevidys to receive an expanded Duchenne muscular dystrophy label on its FDA action date of June 21. UBS initiated coverage of Agree Realty(ADC) with a Neutral rating and $60 price target. The firm has a cautious stance on the triple net lease real estate investment trust group, saying external growth opportunities will remain limited into 2025, which should weigh on funds from operations growth. The firm's constructive view on Realty Income (O) and Essential Properties Realty Trust (EPRT) is based on visibility into leverage-neutral investments and accretive spreads. Citi initiated coverage of Lionsgate Studios(LION) with a Buy rating and $14 price target. The company has a long, successful track record as a pure play content company, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Beazer Homes(BZH) with an Outperform rating and $37 price target. The firm thinks an improved leverage profile, Beazer's substantial lot count, and a differentiated product support a volume inflection and believes the valuation \"looks attractive,\" the analyst tells investors.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's Why You Should Retain Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Stock Now",
        "content": "Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN will likely benefit from solid Macau performance, non-gaming businesses and development projects. Also, focus on strategic expansion plans bodes well. However, increased operating expenses are a concern.\r\n\r\nLet us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.\n\nFactors Likely to Drive Growth\n\nWynn Resorts has been benefitting from solid Macau performance. Following the elimination of COVID-19 protective measures by Macau authorities in January 2023, visitation to Macau and the company's operations improved, leading to increased business volumes in first-quarter 2024. During the first quarter, Wynn Palace reported operating revenues of $586.9 million, up $217.5 million from $369.4 million in the same period in 2023. WYNN's operating revenues came in at $411.7 million, rising by $181.0 million from $230.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. Higher gaming volumes, increased hotel occupancy and restaurant covers backed the upside.\r\n\r\nThe company stated that the positive momentum continued into the second quarter, with a 30% increase in mass drop per day in April (compared to April 2019) and a 99% hotel occupancy rate. The company reported a 30% rise in mass drop per day (compared with the same period in 2019) during May's Golden Week.\r\n\r\nIncreased focus on non-gaming avenues bode well. In the first quarter, the company reported robust performance across non-gaming businesses with 16% year-on-year revenue growth, driven by a 21% increase in hotel revenues and strong casino volumes. The upside can be attributed to exceptional service levels, continuous property reinvestment and the unique Only at Wynn programming. The company registered positive momentum into April with increases in Drop, Handle and RevPAR (revenue per available room) on a year-on-year basis.\n\nIn Macau's development realm, the company has started initial demolition and construction on its second concession project, the Destination Food Hall. It has also advanced in the design and planning stages for other major concession-related capital expenditure commitments, including a new event and entertainment center with a unique theater and show. These projects require various government approvals, leading to a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. The company expects CapEx for these commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million from 2024 through 2025-end. The company believes that the proposed investments and projects will drive growth in the coming periods.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. The company is considering greenfield development opportunities in New York City and potentially Thailand. In New York, a full-scale Wynn integrated resort at Hudson Yards is anticipated to generate significant tax revenue, tourism and employment. Despite delays in the RFA submission process, the company maintains interest in securing a location in Manhattan. In Thailand, the company is closely monitoring regulatory and licensing developments.\n\nStory continues\n\nConcerns Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have declined 10.8% compared with the industry\u2019s 2.8% fall. A challenging macro environment mainly caused the downside.\r\n\r\nIncreased operating expenses are a concern for the company. During the first quarter of 2024, the company\u2019s total operating expenses came in at $1.5 billion compared with $1.25 billion reported in the prior-year period. The upside was primarily due to a rise in casino, room, food and beverage, retail and other and general and administrative expenses. Moving ahead, the company is cautious of inflation and interest rate fluctuations.\n\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\n\nWynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:\r\n\r\nStrategic Education, Inc. STRA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "content": "Although the revenge travel phenomenon appears to have faded, the broader industry could still be enticing, thereby making an attractive case for casino stocks with dividends.\n\nDuring the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, quarantined households longed for the day when normalcy would return. This pent-up demand fueled the aforementioned revenge travel sentiment. Post pandemic, the concept of revenge has diminished. But in its place is a wider push for travel prioritization.\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible that consumer economic challenges such as elevated inflation and high borrowing costs may crimp demand for exotic vacations. At the same time, integrated casinos may offer big bank for the buck. With that, below are casino stocks with dividends to roll the dice on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.\n\nSource: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Las Vegas, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) designs, develops and operates integrated resorts. Per its public profile, the enterprise operates in four segments: Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations and Encore Boston Harbor. Analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $129 average price target. Further, the most optimistic target calls for a per-share price of $138.\n\nFinancially, what makes WYNN an attractive idea for casino stocks with dividends is the robustly consistent performances. In the four quarters since the first quarter of this year, Wynn\u2019s average positive earnings surprise clocked in at 44.38%. This magnitude of profitability easily allows Wynn to fuel its forward dividend yield of 1.02%. It\u2019s not much but the payout ratio is only 16.74%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts are looking for earnings per share of $5.96 on sales of $7.37 billion. That\u2019s a strong improvement over last year\u2019s results of earnings of $4.10 per share on revenue of $6.53 billion. In fiscal 2025, these stats could rise again to EPS of $6.19 on consensus sales of $7.53 billion.\n\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS) a red sign with the Las Vegas Sands (LVS) logo\n\nSource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in its namesake city, Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) along with its subsidiaries develops, owns and operates integrated resorts in Macao and Singapore. Per its corporate profile, the company\u2019s integrated resorts feature accommodations, gaming, entertainment and retail malls and convention halls. Analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $61.73 average price target.\n\nFinancially, Las Vegas Sands isn\u2019t always the most consistent player. That was demonstrated when it incurred a modest miss in Q4. Nevertheless, the overall average positive earnings surprise came out to 5.83% in the past four quarters. This helps the company support its forward dividend yield of 1.73%. Again, it\u2019s not the most generous source of passive income. Still, the payout ratio is low at 24.28%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will rise to $2.71 on sales of $11.8 billion. That\u2019s a nice improvement over last year\u2019s results of $1.89 EPS on revenue of $10.37 billion. Further, fiscal 2025 could see EPS of $3.10 with a top line of $12.73 billion. It\u2019s one of the casino stocks with dividends to buy or at least to put on your watch list.\n\nGolden Entertainment (GDEN) An image of a tan building corner that has a blue \"STRAT\" logo on it with some trees and a blue light post in front.\n\nSource: chara_stagram / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso hailing from Sin City, Golden Entertainment (NASDAQ:GDEN) owns and operates a diversified entertainment platform. According to its corporate profile, Golden operates through four segments: Nevada Casino Resorts, Nevada Locals Casinos, Nevada Taverns and Distributed Gaming. Analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy. Also, the average price target lands at $41.75, with a high-side target of $46.\n\nOne of the intriguing ideas, GDEN is also a source of excitement. I don\u2019t necessarily mean that in the positive sense. For example, outside of a huge print in Q3 last year, Golden consistently fell below its bottom-line quarterly forecasts. That said, what makes the company attractive to speculators is the yield. At 3.2%, its well above much of the competition.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts are projecting EPS to reach $2.18 on revenue of $699.53 million. This is where circumstances get a bit tricky because last year, the company posted EPS of $8.70 on sales of $1.05 billion. However, it appears that analysts are banking on the travel prioritization trend, which could make GDEN one of the casino stocks with dividends to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Should You Buy Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) For Its Upcoming Dividend?",
        "content": "Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Wynn Resorts' shares before the 17th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of May.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.00 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Wynn Resorts has a trailing yield of approximately 1.0% on its current stock price of US$96.39. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Wynn Resorts's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Wynn Resorts has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 13% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 12% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Wynn Resorts, with earnings per share up 7.6% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share have been increasing steadily and management is reinvesting almost all of the profits back into the business. If profits are reinvested effectively, this could be a bullish combination for future earnings and dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Wynn Resorts's dividend payments per share have declined at 22% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIs Wynn Resorts an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share have been growing moderately, and Wynn Resorts is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends, which is an attractive combination as it suggests the company is investing in growth. It might be nice to see earnings growing faster, but Wynn Resorts is being conservative with its dividend payouts and could still perform reasonably over the long run. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.\n\nWith that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Be aware that Wynn Resorts is showing 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those are a bit concerning...\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

        "content": "Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $1.94, expectations were $1.43. Wynn Resorts, Limited isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Welcome to the Wynn Resorts First Quarter Earnings Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the line over to Julie Cameron-Doe, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nJulie Cameron-Doe: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today are Craig Billings and Brian Gullbrants in Las Vegas. Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto, and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under Safe Harbor Federal Securities Laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings. Aerial view of a luxury hotel tower surrounded by lush green landscaping.\n\nCraig Billings: Thanks, Julie, and afternoon, everyone. As always, thanks for joining us today. The momentum that we generated in the business throughout 2023 continued into 2024, as we delivered all-time record property EBITDAR of $647 million during the first quarter of 2024. I'm incredibly proud of all of our team members who remain so focused on delivering 5 star service and one of the kind experiences to our guests, a heartfelt thank you to each of you. Turning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $246 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a first quarter record and up 6% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. As we noted on our last call, most of the action in the quarter was concentrated in February, as the combination of Super Bowl and Chinese New Year drove all-time record EBITDA during the month.\n\nQuarter was characterized by strong performance across our non-gaming businesses with revenue growing 16% year-on-year, led by 21% growth in hotel revenue, along with healthy volumes in the casino. Through our unique combination of the best service levels in the market, continuous reinvestment in our property, and our Only at Wynn programming, we continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas. More recently, our top-line trends remained healthy in April with Drop, Handle, and RevPAR all up year-over-year on yet another difficult comp. Turning to Boston. Encore generated $63 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. The team in Boston successfully navigated a confluence of poor weather in January and inflationary pressures during the quarter as EBITDAR and revenue at the property were largely stable year-on-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were encouraging pockets of strength in the quarter with record slot handle and strong year-on-year growth in hotel revenue. More recently, demand has remained healthy through April with particular strength in slot handle and RevPAR. On the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we have put this development on hold for the time being, as we have been unable to reach an agreement with local authorities on certain financial terms. Though it's disappointing, we have numerous other development projects globally where we can redirect the capital we intended to deploy in Boston. Turning to Macau. We generated $340 million of EBITDAR in the quarter on GGR market share that was above both the prior quarter and above our 2019 exit rate.\n\nSee also\n\n10 Weakest Militaries in Africa and\n\nInsiders are Buying These 10 Undervalued Bank Stocks.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Beats Q1 Sales Targets\n\nLuxury hotels and casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) reported Q1 CY2024 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue up 30.9% year on year to $1.86 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $1.59 per share, improving from its profit of $0.29 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Wynn Resorts? Find out in our full research report.\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $1.86 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.80 billion (3.5% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $1.59 vs analyst estimates of $1.39 (14.6% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 44.5%, down from 64.3% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $10.97 billion\n\n\"The strong momentum we experienced in our business throughout 2023 continued to build during the first quarter with Adjusted Property EBITDAR reaching a new all-time record. The investments we have made in our properties, our team and our unique programming continue to extend our leadership position in each of our markets,\" said Craig Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts, Limited.\n\nFounded by the former Mirage Resorts CEO, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a global developer and operator of high-end hotels and casinos, known for its luxurious properties and premium guest services.\n\nCasino Operator\n\nCasino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it\u2019s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand.\n\nSales Growth\n\nA company\u2019s long-term performance can give signals about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones muster years of growth. Wynn Resorts's revenue was flat over the last five years. Wynn Resorts Total Revenue\n\nWithin consumer discretionary, a long-term historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or emerging trend. That's why we also follow short-term performance. Wynn Resorts's annualized revenue growth of 32.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting some bright spots.\n\nWe can better understand the company's revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Casino, Hotel, and Dining and Entertainment, which are 60.2%, 17.6%, and 14.3% of revenue. Over the last two years, Wynn Resorts's revenues in all three segments increased.Casino revenue (Poker, slots) averaged year-on-year growth of 61.6% while Hotel (food, beverage, Wynn Interactive) and Dining and Entertainment (overnight bookings) averaged 35.8% and 13.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis quarter, Wynn Resorts reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 30.9%, and its $1.86 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street's estimates by 3.5%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nOperating Margin\n\nOperating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income\u2013the bottom line\u2013excluding the impact of taxes and interest on debt, which are less connected to business fundamentals.\n\nWynn Resorts has done a decent job managing its expenses over the last eight quarters. The company has produced an average operating margin of 10.7%, higher than the broader consumer discretionary sector. Wynn Resorts Operating Margin (GAAP)\n\nIn Q1, Wynn Resorts generated an operating profit margin of 19.5%, up 7.6 percentage points year on year.\n\nOver the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Wynn Resorts to become more profitable. Analysts are expecting the company\u2019s LTM operating margin of 14.8% to rise to 18.1%.\n\nKey Takeaways from Wynn Resorts's Q1 Results\n\nIt was good to see Wynn Resorts beat analysts' revenue and EPS expectations this quarter, although Hotel revenue unfortunately missed. Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter that should please shareholders. The stock is up 2.5% after reporting and currently trades at $99.67 per share.\n\nWynn Resorts may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we express in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, reductions in discretionary consumer spending, adverse macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels of disposable consumer income and wealth, changes in interest rates, inflation, a decline in general economic activity or recession in the U.S. and/or global economies, extensive regulation of our business, pending or future legal proceedings, ability to maintain gaming licenses and concessions, dependence on key employees, general global political conditions, adverse tourism trends, travel disruptions caused by events outside of our control, dependence on a limited number of resorts, competition in the casino/hotel and resort industries, uncertainties over the development and success of new gaming and resort properties, construction and regulatory risks associated with current and future projects (including Wynn Al Marjan Island), cybersecurity risk and our leverage and ability to meet our debt service obligations. Additional information concerning potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by the Company's other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n(1) \"Adjusted Property EBITDAR\" is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course, meeting and convention, and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDAR as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. We also present Adjusted Property EBITDAR because it is used by some investors to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDAR as a supplement to GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDAR calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDAR does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, triple-net operating lease rent expense related to Encore Boston Harbor, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDAR. Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDAR may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\n\n(2) \"Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited\" is net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited before pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, change in derivatives fair value, loss on debt financing transactions, and foreign currency remeasurement and other, net of noncontrolling interests and income taxes calculated using the specific tax treatment applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share are presented as supplemental disclosures to financial measures in accordance with GAAP because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used to measure the performance, and as a principal basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited per diluted share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\n\nThe Company has included schedules in the tables that accompany this release that reconcile (i) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to adjusted net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited, (ii) operating income (loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDAR, and (iii) net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDAR.\n\nWYNN RESORTS, LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended\n\nMarch 31, 2024 2023

beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis. (2) In Macau, table drop is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage. In Las Vegas, table drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box. At Encore Boston Harbor, table drop is the amount of cash and gross markers that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box. (3) Slot machine win is calculated as gross slot machine win minus progressive accruals and free play. (4) ADR is average daily rate and is calculated by dividing total room revenues including complimentaries (less service charges, if any) by total rooms occupied. (5) REVPAR is revenue per available room and is calculated by dividing total room revenues including complimentaries (less service charges, if any) by total rooms available. (6) Refer to accompanying reconciliations of Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Net Income Attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited to Adjusted Property EBITDAR.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240507487307/en/\n\nContacts\n\nPrice Karr\r\n702-770-7555\r\ninvestorrelations@wynnresorts.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "US Stocks Eye Fourth Positive Session Despite Hawkish Fed Remarks; Disney, Palantir Tumble; Treasury Yields Fall: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nWall Street experienced a quiet session during morning trading on Tuesday, influenced by a lack of significant economic data and minimal updates on earnings from major large-cap companies.\n\nTraders largely disregarded the latest hawkish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who noted progress on inflation seen in the latter half of 2023 had stalled and mentioned the Federal Reserve might raise rates if inflation becomes persistent.\n\nKashkari also revealed he initially predicted two rate cuts for the year, but now anticipated possibly maintaining two, or reducing to one or none by the June Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nThe S&P 500 saw a modest increase of 0.2% around midday in New York, with similar gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Dow Jones, all of which are poised for their fourth consecutive session of gains. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), representing small caps, performed notably well, rising 0.8%.\n\nTreasury yields declined slightly by about 6 basis points across various maturities from 5 to 30 years, with the 10-year benchmark decreasing to 4.4%, marking a fifth consecutive day of declines. This led to a continued rally in bonds, exemplified by a 1.1% increase in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT).\n\nIn corporate news, chipmaker Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) saw its shares drop over 13% following weaker-than-expected guidance. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) also fell sharply by over 10%, setting it on course for its worst performance day since November 2022.\n\nIn the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) remained stable at $63,800, while both gold and silver declined by 0.5%\n\nTuesday\u2019s Performance In Major U.S. Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.99 0.7% S&P 500 5,193.42 0.2% Nasdaq 100 18,137.08 0.2% Dow Jones 38,914.33 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12 p.m. EDT\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) rose 0.3% to $518.80, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.6% to $389.01 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rose 0.3% to $441.54, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) outperformed, up 1.1%, followed by the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB), 1%.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and see the top 5 stocks in this list,\u00a0click Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nCramer Thanks Powell for \"All-Clear\" Sign\n\nJim Cramer last week thanked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for giving an \"all-clear\" sign by keeping interest rates unchanged. Cramer said that the Fed's dovish comments catapulted the market from the pits of deep red to new highs.\n\nJerome Powell: \"The Bull's Best Friend\"\n\nHe thinks Jerome Powell has become \"the bull's friend for the moment, maybe best friend.\" Jim Cramer said that despite the signs of \"softness all over the place,\" Powell is currently \"more of a dove than a hawk\" since he believes inflation will \"go away on its own.\"\n\nPowell Takes Another Rate-Hike Scenario Off the Table\n\nCramer said Jerome Powell was \"badgered\" by the media about the possibility of another rate hike. But Powell, according to Cramer, is \"too smart\" as he didn\u2019t take the \"bait\" and took the \"dreaded\" rate hike scenario \"off the table.\"\n\n\" I think Jay Powell has realized that these brown shoots are doing the work for him and his consistent messaging in the face of endless Fedspeak tells me that I think you should hand on to stocks.\"\n\nCramer Laments About The Market's Obsession with Fed\n\nJim Cramer in another program last week again voiced his frustrations about the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve's comment, saying jobs numbers, inflation, possibility of rate cuts and the Fed's future moves is \"all we talk about.\" Cramer said that some analysts were expecting the Fed chief Jerome Powell to \"lower the boom\" of the stock market by \"saying something hawkish.\" Cramer is surprised that some circles in the market are talking about another raise.\n\n\"We are one again hostage to everyone's worries about the Fed which is another way of saying, everyone's worries about inflation.\"\n\nJim Cramer on What Should You Buy in the Current Environment\n\nAfter analyzing the current market situation, Cramer came straight to what matters the most for an average investor:\n\n\"So, what wins in this environment? What do you do? Well, pretty much everything is going to kind of work here,\" Cramer said before analyzing different stocks some of which we will discuss in this article.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon't Miss: Jim Cramer's Stock Picks Heading into May 2024 Jim Cramer Says \"Hang On To Stocks\" and Recommends 10 Stocks to Buy\n\nFor this article we watched latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors in the current market environment. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 46\n\nJim Cramer is anxiously waiting for the latest quarter report from Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) as his charitable trust owns a position in the company. In a latest program, Cramer highlighted that Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) has two casinos in Macau. Cramer is bullish on the China business of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) because he thinks the Chinese are \"willing to travel locally.\"\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited\u00a0(NASDAQ:WYNN)\u00a0is scheduled to post earnings May 7 after markets close.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe shares of\u00a0Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), an owner and operator of hotels and casino resorts, declined modestly in the most recent quarter, in part due to concerns about economic weakness in China.\n\nWe remain optimistic about the multi-year prospects for the company. We believe the ongoing re-emergence of business activity in Macau will drive additional shareholder value. If cash flow returns to the level achieved in 2019 prior to COVID-19, we believe Wynn\u2019s shares will increase 30% to 50% higher than where they have recently traded.\n\nWe believe additional drivers for future value creation beyond a re-emergence in Macau business activity include: (i) our expectation for long-term growth opportunities in the company\u2019s U.S.-centric markets of Las Vegas and Boston, including an expansion of Wynn\u2019s Encore Boston Harbor resort; (ii) Wynn\u2019s plans to develop an integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates with 1,500 hotel rooms and a casino that is similar in size to that of Encore Boston Harbor; (iii) opportunities to improve cash-flow margins by rightsizing labor and achieving lower staff costs in Macau; (iv) the possibility that Wynn is granted a New York casino license; and (v) an expansion in the company\u2019s valuation multiple to levels achieved prior to the pandemic.\u201d\n\n9. Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 47\n\nA caller reminded Jim Cramer during his program that he was bullish on Cloud software company Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA) last month. The stock is down about 3.3% over the past 30 days. The questioner asked whether Cramer is still bullish on the company.\n\n\"Oh am I ever, I think Okta is terrific.\"\n\nCramer also praised Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) CEO Todd McKinnon and said that he was \"humbled\" by the hacking attack and \"learned\" from it. Cramer was referring to the attack on Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in which hackers, according to the company, stole data of almost all users of its customer support system.\n\nMeridian Growth Fund made the following comment about Okta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOkta, Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) is the largest independent identity software company, serving enterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits, and government agencies across the globe. Its solutions provide higher-level security authentication services, a business-critical function that has the attention of CEOs and IT leaders everywhere. The company\u2019s integration with 7,000 other software vendors and system providers is a competitive advantage that enables rapid and seamless implementations. Okta\u2019s complete product suite allows customers to deploy an enterprise-wide identity platform that serves both the workforce segment (clients\u2019 employees) and the customer segments (clients\u2019 customers). The stock has started to recover after falling nearly 85% from post-COVID bubble levels due to a stabilization in the overall macro environment for security services. The company has also seen a normalization in salesforce attrition which had hampered growth. The stock moved higher during the quarter when it reported higher than expected revenues and a much-improved adjusted operating margin of 11% versus -3% in the prior year quarter. Beyond its core capabilities, which are in high demand, we are also encouraged by the company\u2019s ability to expand into product adjacencies such as privileged access management and identity governance. Due to these improving fundamentals, we added to our position in the company during the period.\u201d\n\n8. Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 56\n\nJim Cramer earlier this month hit the \"buy, buy, buy\" button on Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), saying the stock is \"cheap.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) CEO Michael Dell is \"terrific.\" Cramer said Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL) is a \"good stock to own\" and he wants people to buy it. In addition to DELL, he's also recommending Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 56 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Dell Technologies Inc\u00a0(NYSE:DELL).\u00a0The most notable stake in Dell Technologies Inc\u00a0(NYSE:DELL)\u00a0is owned by Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management which owns a $383 million stake in Dell Technologies Inc\u00a0(NYSE:DELL).\n\n7. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Costco Wholesale Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:COST). He said he \"likes Costco very much.\" Last month Costco Wholesale Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0upped its dividend by 13.7%. Jim Cramer praised this news and said the hike shows the stock has the potential to go higher.\n\n6. HCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 72\n\nJim Cramer is bullish on HCA Healthcare Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HCA), saying HCA Healthcare Inc's (NYSE:HCA)\u00a0latest quarter was \"good.\"\n\n\"I'm going to have to go with it. I know it's been uneven last year but it's been a great long-term horse.\"\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc (NYSE:HCA) recently posted first quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $5.93. Revenue in the quarter jumped 11.2% year over year to $17.34 billion.\n\nOf the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 72 hedge funds reported owning stakes in HCA Healthcare Inc\u00a0(NYSE:HCA).\n\nIn addition to HCA, investors are also watching Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe eliminated one position,\u00a0HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), during the quarter as the stock traded at our estimate of fair value. HCA was a very good investment and more than quadrupled from our original investment price in 2016. We believe HCA is a well-managed business with the best collection of assets in the hospital space. Hospital stocks tend to be much more volatile than their actual intrinsic value, and we would gladly purchase HCA again if the discount to value warrants.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Recommends 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Portfolio: 11 Latest Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer\u2019s New Picks: 10 Stocks to Buy Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks Heading Into May 2024\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN is scheduled to release first-quarter 2024 results on May 7, 2024, after the closing bell. In the previous quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 70.5%.\n\nHow are Estimates Placed?\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter bottom line is pegged at $1.43 per share, indicating a surge of 393.1% from 29 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $1.8 billion. The metric suggests an improvement of 24.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure.\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price and EPS Surprise\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited price-eps-surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited Quote\n\nLet's look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nWynn Resorts\u2019 first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from an uptick in visitation and demand, particularly in the Las Vegas and Macau regions. This and strength in mass casino drop, direct VIP turnover, luxury retail sales and hotel revenues are likely to have aided the company\u2019s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect revenues from Macau operations to rise 34.3% year over year to $806 million.\r\n\r\nEmphasis on the Super Bowl and Chinese New Year events and an uptick in group and convention businesses are likely to have aided the company's first-quarter performance. The company reported that the front money and credit for the period between the Super Bowl and Chinese New Year have doubled on a year-over-year basis, paving a path for robust hotel revenues during the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nIncreased visitation in the Las Vegas market and strong contributions from RevPAR table drop, slot handle and food and beverage are likely to have supported the company\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Per our model, revenues from Las Vegas operations are expected to rise 6.8% year over year to $626.7 million.\r\n\r\nStrong contributions from Encore Boston Harbor might have aided the company\u2019s first-quarter top line. The emphasis on development projects (including incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities) and increased sign-ups (to the Wynn Rewards loyalty program) have been a catalyst for WYNN. The momentum is expected to have driven top-line growth. We expect revenues from Encore Boston Harbor to rise 2.4% year over year (to $221.5 million) in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, challenges such as a softer macroeconomic environment in China and winter storms might have dampened visitation during the first quarter. An increase in operating expenses could further dent profitability for the period.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur take\n\nGiven the information provided, investors might find it advantageous to contemplate acquiring Wynn Resorts\u2019 shares before the unveiling of its first-quarter results. Encouraging signals, such as anticipated rises in visitation and demand, coupled with a strong performance during events like the Super Bowl and Chinese New Year and an increase in group and convention businesses, hint at the potential for favorable earnings outcomes.\r\n\r\nRegarding valuation, WYNN shares present an appealing opportunity. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 17.67X, below the Zacks gaming-industry average of 31.68X, the stock offers compelling value for investors aiming for exposure to the gaming industry.\r\n\r\nThese positive indicators suggest that the company's growth trajectory remains promising, presenting an opportune moment for investors to consider investing in the stock ahead of first-quarter results.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Wynn Resorts this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.\r\n\r\nEarnings ESP: Wynn Resorts has an Earnings ESP of +2.40%.

It is anticipated to be the first integrated gaming resort in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region.\n\nWynn Design and Development, employing more than 90 talented architects, designers, and creative visionaries, is overseeing all facets of the project's design and development. Wynn Resorts is unique in that it maintains its own full-service design and architectural team.\n\nWynn Design and Development has created all of Wynn's bespoke gaming resorts. Having designed and developed iconic resorts on two continents, and now with another in Ras Al Khaimah, it is safe to say no single design and architecture team has had a greater impact on the creation of gaming resorts globally than Wynn Design and Development.\n\n\"Historically, the area around Ras Al Khaimah was a beacon for navigation and important trade on the Arabian Gulf. Early travelers through the gulf relied upon this tented settlement as a trade landmark between the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian Sea,\" said Todd Lenahan, President and Chief Creative Officer of Wynn Design and Development. \"We designed the 300-meter-tall resort tower with Ras Al Khaimah's historic role as a great navigational sentinel in mind. We hope this becomes a new landmark, a new beacon, for travelers to Ras A Khaimah from across the globe.\"\n\nOverlooking its own white sand beach with views of both the Arabian Gulf and the natural beauty of Ras Al Khaimah rising to the Hajar Mountains, Wynn Al Marjan Island will offer guests the full complement of luxury amenities and experiences. It will feature 1,542 rooms and well-appointed suites, including 22 opulent and private Villa Estates situated on the newly designed marina adjacent to the resort. There will also be an extensive poolscape adjacent to the beach with multiple swimming and wading pools, water features, private cabanas, and tropical landscaping covering 3.6 hectares.\n\nThe curated collection of 22 dining, lounge and bar experiences will each be presented in their own uniquely designed space, many with views of the beach and poolscape. The theater will feature bespoke production shows.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe resort will also include a 15,000-square-meter shopping esplanade filled with the world's top luxury boutiques, a five-star spa, and a salon. The 7,500-square-meter meetings and events center has been designed to accommodate meetings, conventions, and special celebrations such as weddings. There will also be ample outdoor event terraces and lawns.\n\nWynn Al Marjan Island began construction in early 2023 with construction led by UAE-based main contractor ALEC Engineering and Contracting. Currently, the structure is about 40 meters tall. The full tower height, more than 300 meters tall, is expected to be topped off in the fourth quarter of 2025. The resort will open to the public in early 2027.\n\nRas Al Khaimah is one of the fastest growing tourism markets in the MENA region, conveniently located near the Ras Al Khaimah, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi airports. Comprised of four islands, Al Marjan Island delights visitors with nearly five miles of sparkling beaches and 24 kilometers of waterfront, in addition to world-class hotels and residential developments.\n\nFor additional information, visit press.wynnalmarjan.com.\n\nAbout Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts, Limited is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol WYNN and is part of the S&P 500 Index.

        "content": "Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Q1 Earnings: What To Expect\n\nLuxury hotels and casino operator Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) will be reporting results tomorrow afternoon. Here's what to expect.\n\nWynn Resorts beat analysts' revenue expectations by 5.9% last quarter, reporting revenues of $1.84 billion, up 83.1% year on year. It was a stunning quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nIs Wynn Resorts a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting Wynn Resorts's revenue to grow 26.4% year on year to $1.80 billion, slowing from the 49.3% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.39 per share. Wynn Resorts Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. Wynn Resorts has missed Wall Street's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Wynn Resorts's peers in the casino operator segment, some have already reported their Q1 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. MGM Resorts delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 13.2%, beating analysts' expectations by 3.7%, and Bally's reported revenues up 3.3%, falling short of estimates by 1.4%. MGM Resorts traded up 2.9% following the results while Bally's was down 1.1%.\n\nRead our full analysis of MGM Resorts's results here and Bally's results here.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 thanks to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the casino operator stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 3.4% on average over the last month. Wynn Resorts is down 8.2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $124.3 (compared to the current share price of $97.29).\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: Roblox (RBLX) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "The market expects Roblox (RBLX) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis online gaming platform is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $931.05 million, up 20.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Roblox?\n\nFor Roblox, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.24%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Roblox will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Roblox would post a loss of $0.57 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.52, delivering a surprise of +8.77%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nRoblox doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN), another stock in the Zacks Gaming industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.43 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +393.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.77 billion, up 24.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Wynn has been revised 2.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.40%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Wynn will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street analysts forecast that Wynn Resorts (WYNN) will report quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 393.1%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $1.77 billion, exhibiting an increase of 24.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone an upward revision of 2.2% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors typically rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to gauge how the business may have fared during the quarter, examining analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics often helps gain a deeper insight.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Wynn metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Operating revenues- Las Vegas Operations' stands at $616.30 million. The estimate points to a change of +5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Operating revenues- Macau Operations' will reach $899.39 million. The estimate points to a change of +49.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Operating revenues- Encore Boston Harbor' should come in at $215.08 million. The estimate points to a change of -0.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Operating revenues- Wynn Interactive' should arrive at $17.96 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -12.5%.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'REVPAR - Wynn Las Vegas' will reach $496.35. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $438 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Room occupancy rate - Wynn Las Vegas' to come in at 91.6%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 88.8%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Average daily room rate - Wynn Las Vegas' to reach $542.09. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $493.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Average number of slot machines - Wynn Las Vegas' at 1,645. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 1,668 in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Average number of table games - Wynn Las Vegas' will reach 235. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 232.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Room occupancy rate - Wynn Macau' will likely reach 100.8%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 90.9%.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'REVPAR - Wynn Macau' reaching $273.40. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $220.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Average daily room rate - Wynn Macau' of $271.58.

        "title": "How to Find Strong Consumer Discretionary Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Walt Disney (DIS) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.12 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 7, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.09 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Walt Disney has an Earnings ESP of 2.17%.\n\nDIS is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Wynn Resorts (WYNN).\n\nWynn Resorts, which is readying to report earnings on May 14, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

        "content": "LAS VEGAS, April 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN) has released its 2023 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report and Corporate Responsibility Review outlining the Company's 2023 responsibility programs.

The Corporate Responsibility Review recounts our commitments to our employees, the positive impacts of Wynn's activities in the communities in which it operates, and our long-term goals of doing the right thing for the planet.\n\n\"If you look at our Core Values and Behaviors in this report, you will see that the ideals of caring for people, fair treatment, taking personal responsibility, and driving ongoing improvement are built into who we are,\" said Craig S. Billings, CEO of Wynn Resorts. \"Those values, in turn, influence who we hire, and that makes all the difference in a business like ours.\"\n\nThe Company, under the pillars of Our People, Our Communities, and Our Planet, accomplished key metrics in advancing environmental initiatives, social impact, and governance, with notable items including:\n\nWynn Las Vegas diverted 41% of resort waste from landfills, setting a historic waste diversion record.

Wynn employees donated more than $1 million to the Wynn Resorts Foundation in direct contributions and fundraising efforts, the highest fundraising year in Company history. In total, Wynn Resorts contributed almost $9 million in cash and in-kind donations to charitable organizations throughout North America. These contributions, as well as the 35,000 hours of volunteerism donated by Wynn employees, illustrate why Wynn Resorts was named as one of the Best Brands for Social Impact in 2023 by Forbes. Wynn Resorts powered resorts in North America with 29% renewable energy. The Company's investment in energy independence laid the groundwork for progressing toward Wynn's goal to become Net-Zero by 2050.

Wynn's U.S. resorts sourced 100% of eggs from cage-free suppliers in 2023, and the company has recently committed to sourcing\u00a0100% cage-free eggs globally by 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth the ESG Report and Corporate Responsibility Review are\u00a0available at WynnResponsibility.com.\n\nAbout Wynn Resorts Wynn Resorts, Limited is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol WYNN and is part of the S&P 500 Index.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 leisure and recreation services stocks to buy. To skip our detailed analysis, go directly to the 5 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Buy.\n\nDuring the market downturns of the last five years, the leisure and recreation industry bore the brunt of the damage. Nevertheless, the industry showed resilience over the years and its comeback was stellar. The industry underperformed the broader market in 2023, with The Invesco Leisure and Entertainment ETF (NYSEARCA:PEJ) returning just over 15% returns, compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 25%. However, it has gotten back on its feet from October 2023 lows. Over the last six months, the S&P 500 is up 21.7%, while Invesco Leisure and Entertainment ETF (NYSEARCA:PEJ) is over 27% higher, as of April 25.\n\nKey Stock Trends Reflecting Strong Consumer Spending\n\nDespite the ups and downs in the market, US consumer spending has remained robust. On April 16, Bank of America Corporation's (NYSE:BAC) president, Brian Thomas Moynihan told CNBC on April 16 that contrary to expectations, the consumer's spending power and wages managed to keep pace with inflation. He added that while the spending has slowed down, it is still \"hanging in there.\" The performance of some of the best leisure and recreation stocks such as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) is also a testament to the fact that the US consumers are responsible for keeping the market healthy.\n\nIn FY23, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported an EPS of $117.40, up 54% year-over-year and sales growth of 25.01%. The company reported annual revenue of $21.4 billion. In addition, the company reported impressive gross margins of 96.89% for FY23. Wedgewood Partners made the following comments about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBooking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) contributed negatively to relative performance. The Company grew bookings on their platforms +16% and reported +22% growth in adjusted operating income during their fourth quarter of 2023. We think the market is cautious about the Company\u2019s results for 2024 because they will be lapping very high levels of growth compared to those in 2023 (full year 2023 bookings growth +24%). However, Booking\u2019s end markets continue to be quite healthy, outside of geographies affected by war because consumers still have plenty of wallet share to re-dedicate to travel compared to pre-COVID-19 numbers. We applaud the Company as they aggressively repurchase shares at valuation levels well below the market and peers. This should serve to compound our ownership in Booking\u2019s business, which has exceptional pro2itability.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HLT) stock has outperformed the S&P 500, recording nearly 44.28% share price growth over the past twelve months as of April 25, its profitability took a slight hit in 2023 as the travel demand normalized in the year. In 2022, the pent-up leisure travel demand after the COVID-19 pandemic made healthy profits for the company. However, the company\u2019s net income dropped from $1.257 billion in 2022 to $1.151 billion in 2023. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s revenue per available room increased by 12.6% in 2023 due to an increase in occupancy and average daily rate. Finally, the company reported record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.1 billion as mentioned by the company\u2019s CEO, Chris Nassetta at Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.\u2019s (NYSE:HLT) latest earnings call:\n\n\u201cStrong top line performance drove record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.1 billion, up roughly 20% year-over-year to the highest level in our company's history. During the year, we launched two new brands, introduced new innovations, expanded our partnerships and opened a near record number of rooms, all of which further strengthened our network and enabled us to welcome more guests than ever before.\n\nOur strong top and bottom line performance drove significant free cash flow, enabling us to return $2.5 billion to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe Multibagger Leisure Stock\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) has been making strides since last year. The company is one of our best multibagger stocks as its stock price has gained more than 123% over the last twelve months, as of April 25. The company released its first-quarter 2024 earnings on April 25 and reported an EPS of $1.77, ahead of analysts' estimates by $0.46. In addition, the company's revenue grew by 29% year-over-year and amounted to $3.7 billion. After a strong Q1 performance, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) also raised its Q2 2024 and full-year guidance. The company expects an EPS of $2.65 to $2.75 for the second quarter and an EPS of $10.70 to $10.90 for FY24. The company's CEO Jason Liberty made the following comments at its Q1 earnings call:\n\n\"In the first quarter, we delivered 2 million memorable vacations and achieved 107% load factor at exceptional guest satisfaction scores. Yields grew 19.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023, almost 400 basis points above our initial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was considerably higher than our guidance. Strong ticket and onboard revenue and favorable timing of expenses contributed to the better-than-expected earnings performance.\n\nThe acceleration of demand is also translating into higher revenue and earnings expectations for the balance of the year. As you can see on Page 5, we are increasing full-year yield growth expectations by 50% compared to our initial guidance in early February, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 60% year over year. The increased outlook for the year is expected to further accelerate our trajectory toward our trifecta goals as we continue to expect to achieve all three goals in 2024, one year earlier than initially expected. Now I'll provide some insight into the robust demand environment and our incredible wave season.\"\n\nWith this context, let's look at the best leisure and recreation services stocks to buy which include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). 10 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Buy\n\n10 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Buy\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stock screener to identify 20 mid to large-cap leisure and recreation stocks and then narrowed down our list to 10 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The companies are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\n\nThe hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Buy\n\n10. Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 46\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is engaged in the design, development, and operation of integrated resorts. The company offers its services through Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations, and Encore Boston Harbor segments. 46 hedge funds held stakes in the company in the fourth quarter of 2023, with positions worth $959.356 million. Fisher Asset Management is the most significant shareholder of the company, as of December 31, 2023, with a position worth $357.883 million.\n\nAs of April 22, Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN)\u2019s analyst average price target of $116.82 has an upside of 19.84% from the present levels and the stock has a consensus Buy rating among 7 Wall Street analysts.\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) joins The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) on our list of leisure and recreation services stocks to buy.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe shares of Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), an owner and operator of hotels and casino resorts, declined modestly in the most recent quarter, in part due to concerns about economic weakness in China.\n\nWe remain optimistic about the multi-year prospects for the company. We believe the ongoing re-emergence of business activity in Macau will drive additional shareholder value. If cash flow returns to the level achieved in 2019 prior to COVID-19, we believe Wynn\u2019s shares will increase 30% to 50% higher than where they have recently traded.\n\nWe believe additional drivers for future value creation beyond a re-emergence in Macau business activity include: (i) our expectation for long-term growth opportunities in the company\u2019s U.S.-centric markets of Las Vegas and Boston, including an expansion of Wynn\u2019s Encore Boston Harbor resort; (ii) Wynn\u2019s plans to develop an integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates with 1,500 hotel rooms and a casino that is similar in size to that of Encore Boston Harbor; (iii) opportunities to improve cash-flow margins by rightsizing labor and achieving lower staff costs in Macau; (iv) the possibility that Wynn is granted a New York casino license; and (v) an expansion in the company\u2019s valuation multiple to levels achieved prior to the pandemic.\u201d\n\n9. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nLas Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) is an owner, developer, and operator of integrated resorts, including The Venetian Macao Resort Hotel, the Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao, and others.\n\nOn April 18, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.20, payable by May 15 to the shareholders of record on May 1. As of April 22, the stock has a dividend yield of 1.72%.\n\nOn April 18, Citi raised the price target on Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) to $75 from $74 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.\n\nHedge fund sentiment was positive toward Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) in the fourth quarter of 2023 as hedge funds with positions in the stock were 48 in the quarter, with positions worth $2.52 billion. This is compared to 45 funds with positions worth $1.55 billion in Q3. Fisher Asset Management is the most dominant shareholder in the company as of Q4 of 2023. In the quarter, the firm increased its stake by 7% to 11.263 million shares worth $554.282 million.\n\n8. Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) takes the eighth spot on our list of leisure and recreation services stocks to buy and the company operates lodging properties under various brands, including JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, and Westin, among others.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) has seen a trailing twelve-month EPS year-over-year growth of 40.57% and the stock has gone up by 36.18% in the last twelve months, as of April 22.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, 52 hedge funds held positions in Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), and their stakes amounted to $2.4 billion. With 4.39 million shares worth $990.328 million, Fundsmith LLP is the top investor in the company, as of December 31, 2023.\n\nVulcan Value Partners made the following comment about Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is a company that we have owned several times in the past. The company is an asset-light global lodging franchisor and operator that benefits from strong network effects. Approximately 99% of Marriott\u2019s global rooms are managed or franchised which enables the company to generate high returns on capital. Marriott has an extensive portfolio of brands ranging from luxury brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, to premium brands such as Westin Hotels & Resorts, to select brands such as Residence Inn by Marriott. The company is doing an excellent job converting independent hotels into the Marriott system through its soft brands including the Luxury Collection, the Autograph Collection, and the Tribute Portfolio. This conversion opportunity should benefit Marriott\u2019s net unit growth in a period when new hotel development could be challenging in North American and Europe. The company generates robust free cash flow through its long-term, contracted franchise fee and management fee revenue streams. Its competitive advantages include brand strength, operational scale, direct booking systems, and loyalty programs. We sold Marriott in the first quarter of 2020 because of our concerns about the company\u2019s debt structure. Since then, Marriott has restructured its debt and improved its balance sheet. Additionally, average daily rates (ADR) on corporate travel have returned to pre-Covid levels.\u201d\n\n7. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) is a cruise company that operates different brands, including Celebrity Cruises, Silversea Cruise, and more. 54 hedge funds had investments in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in Q4 of 2023 worth $2.417 billion. As of December 31, 2023, D E Shaw is the most prominent shareholder in the company and has a position worth $632.386 million.\n\nOn April 17, Mizuho initiated coverage of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) with a Buy rating and a $164 price target.\n\nAriel Investments stated the following regarding Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSome holdings in the portfolio advanced considerably this quarter. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), advanced on another quarterly earnings beat and subsequent raise in full-year guidance driven by stronger than anticipated consumer demand and solid cost containment. The company continues to experience solid momentum in onboard spend, while 2024 booking trends are significantly ahead of historical ranges at higher pricing. We believe the resiliency of the core cruise consumer in combination with management\u2019s superior operational expertise and revised earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.\u201d\n\n6. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 55\n\nDraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a Massachusetts-based company that offers online sports betting and casino, sports betting and casino gaming software, and daily fantasy sports, among other product offerings.\n\nAs of April 22, DraftKings Inc.

(NASDAQ:BKNG), and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE).\n\nBaron Funds stated the following regarding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to our position in DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ;DKNG), the leading mobile sportsbook and gaming operator in the U.S. While we lowered our estimates for the fourth quarter due to lower hold in the month of November, it is important to keep in mind that while hold can be volatile from quarter to quarter, the company continues to slowly increase hold over time (primarily because of a higher percentage of the handle being in higher hold \u201cparlay\u201d bets). We continue to be attracted to DraftKing\u2019s dominant market share and the scale advantages that come with this.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Best Eventbrite Alternatives for Registration & Ticketing 25 Richest Billionaires in Healthcare Industry 10 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 20 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 14, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.46 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $1.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.43 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Wynn Resorts has an Earnings ESP of 2.4%.\n\nWYNN is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Walt Disney (DIS) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nWalt Disney, which is readying to report earnings on May 7, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.12 a share, and DIS is 13 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walt Disney is $1.09, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.5%.\n\nWYNN and DIS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.88% for the day.

This has was narrower than the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 5.74% and lagged the S&P 500's loss of 2.57% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Wynn Resorts will be of great interest to investors. In that report, analysts expect Wynn Resorts to post earnings of $1.43 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 393.1%.

These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019?

Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility.

        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Wynn Resorts is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.09 = US$1.1b \u00f7 (US$14b - US$2.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nTherefore, Wynn Resorts has an ROCE of 9.0%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Hospitality industry average of 9.6%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Wynn Resorts' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Wynn Resorts .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Wynn Resorts' ROCE Trend?\n\nOver the past five years, Wynn Resorts' ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So don't be surprised if Wynn Resorts doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWe can conclude that in regards to Wynn Resorts' returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has declined 24% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.\n\nOne more thing: We've identified  4 warning signs  with Wynn Resorts (at least 2 which are potentially serious)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this freelist of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 47.93%.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, Wynn was expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share, but it reported $1.91 per share instead, representing a surprise of 70.54%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.79 per share, while it actually produced $0.99 per share, a surprise of 25.32%.\n\nFor Wynn, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nWynn has an Earnings ESP of +2.22% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Q4 Earnings Outperformers: PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) And The Rest Of The Casino Operator Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q4 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) and its peers.\n\nCasino operators enjoy limited competition because gambling is a highly regulated industry. These companies can also enjoy healthy margins and profits. Have you ever heard the phrase \u2018the house always wins\u2019? Regulation cuts both ways, however, and casinos may face stroke-of-the-pen risk that suddenly limits what they can or can't do and where they can do it. Furthermore, digitization is changing the game, pun intended. Whether it\u2019s online poker or sports betting on your smartphone, innovation is forcing these players to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as being able to wager anywhere on demand.\n\nThe 9 casino operator stocks we track reported a slower Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.5%. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and while some of the casino operator stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 0.5% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nWeakest Q4: PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN)\n\nEstablished in 1982, PENN Entertainment (NASDAQ:PENN) is a diversified American operator of casinos, sports betting, and entertainment venues.\n\nPENN Entertainment reported revenues of $1.40 billion, down 12% year on year, falling short of analyst expectations by 9%. It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue estimates.\n\nJay Snowden, Chief Executive Officer and President, said: \u201cPENN delivered another quarter of solid property level performance while continuing to invest in our high growth digital business, which we believe will create significant long term shareholder value. Our retail results reflect strong customer demand and well-executed strategies across our portfolio. In our Interactive segment, ESPN BET attracted significantly more first-time depositors (FTDs) than we anticipated, which drove higher than expected promotional expense. Our successful launch led to substantial expansion in key performance indicators (KPIs) including monthly active users (MAUs), handle, and cash handle. Importantly, strong early retention and consistent user acquisition have led to steady month-over-month increases in cash handle as our promotional expense has started to normalize entering 2024. ESPN BET has also attracted the mass market sports fan, highlighting the potential to expand the appeal of sports betting and grow the overall market. This foundation sets the stage for continued growth and market share gains as we introduce further product enhancements and deeper integrations into the ESPN media ecosystem.\n\nStory continues PENN Entertainment Total Revenue\n\nPENN Entertainment delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates of the whole group.

        "title": "Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Wynn Resorts' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 51% of the business is held by the top 13 shareholders Recent sales by insiders\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 62% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wynn Resorts.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wynn Resorts?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wynn Resorts. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wynn Resorts' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wynn Resorts. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.8% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Wynn Resorts\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Wynn Resorts, Limited. Insiders own US$1.7b worth of shares in the US$11b company. That's quite meaningful. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 5 warning signs  with Wynn Resorts (at least 2 which are potentially serious)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this freereport on analyst forecasts.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "title": "Pack Your Portfolio: 7 Travel Stocks to Buy as Spending Continues",
        "content": "Back when the Covid-19 crisis first capsized the economy, forward-looking investors bet heavily on travel stocks to buy. Simply, they anticipated that pent-up demand would eventually catapult the underlying industry once society fully normalized.\n\nWe now know this phenomenon by a rather aggressive name: revenge travel. Having been forcibly cooped up at home, people couldn\u2019t wait to get out and take the vacations that they were previously denied. Even better, this consumer catalyst has continued to resonate.\n\nNow, experts don\u2019t really call the current framework as travel revenge but rather reprioritization. Basically, that initial, overwhelming impetus to travel may have faded. However, consumers have realized how important these life experiences are. So, many folks are intent on opening their wallets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s a welcome surprise to an industry facing big questions. Below are several travel stocks to buy if you believe in the thesis.\n\nUber (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTechnically a proprietary technology applications provider, Uber (NYSE:UBER) is really a pioneer in the sharing economy. It first disrupted the taxi service with its ride-sharing platform. Over the years, the company has moved into food deliveries and shipping/freight services. It also happens to be one of the travel stocks to buy because of its holistic conveniences.\n\nOverall, UBER makes for a solid investment. In the past fiscal year, the company only missed once, in the third quarter. Back then, Uber posted earnings per share of 10 cents while analysts anticipated a print of 12 cents. However, the average positive surprise for the other three quarters came out to over 739%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate EPS to hit $1.23 atop revenue of $39.71 billion. For context, the company posted EPS of 80 cents on sales of $34.2 billion.\n\nCovering experts rate UBER a consensus strong buy with an $86.70 price target. The high-side target lands at $96, making it an intriguing idea for travel stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nComcast (CMCSA) Keeping NBC News on the Air Could Hamper Comcast Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA media and technology company, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the powerhouses in entertainment. Regarding its relevance as one of the travel stocks to buy, the company owns the NBCUniversal brand. As such, it operates popular theme parks in key locations around the world. Should consumers prioritize vacationing, CMCSA could be an intriguing pickup.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, Comcast has been a reliable player, beating earnings expectations in all four quarters. The average earnings surprise came out to a robust 12.18%. For the current fiscal year, experts see EPS reaching $4.24 on sales of $124.28 billion. In 2023, Comcast posted EPS of $3.98 on revenue of $121.57 billion.\n\nLooking out to fiscal 2025, experts believe EPS could rise to $4.62. And while the consensus revenue target is $124.11 billion, the high-side estimate stands at $128 billion. That could be more reasonable depending on how consumer sentiment plays out.\n\nAnalysts peg shares a consensus moderate buy with a $51.92 average price target. Further, the most optimistic target calls for $57.\n\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.\n\nSource: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.com\n\nA designer, developer and operator of integrated resort properties, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) ranks among the premier travel stocks to buy. Per its public profile, the company operates through four segments: Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau, Las Vegas Operations and Encore Boston Harbor. Since the start of the year, WYNN stock gained over 5%.\n\nNotably, in fiscal 2023, the company posted consistently solid earnings performances, leading to confidence that Wynn can again overachieve in 2024. Most impressively, in Q1, the company generated EPS of 29 cents against an expected loss per share of 1 cent. And for Q2 through Q4, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 50.77%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts anticipate that EPS will land at $5.06 on top of revenue of $7.2 billion. Further, the high-side estimate calls for EPS of $5.96 and sales of $7.42 billion. For comparison, Wynn printed profits of $4.10 per share on sales of $6.53 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\nAnalysts rate WYNN a consensus moderate buy with a $116.82 price target. The high-side target takes aim at the $135 level.\n\nWyndham Hotels & Resorts (WH) A blue sign says Wyndham Hotels & Resorts in front of red and purple flowers\n\nSource: Mihai_Andritoiu / Shutterstock\n\nA hotel franchisor operating in the U.S. and internationally, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:WH) conducts business through two segments: Hotel Franchising and Hotel Management. Per it corporate profile, the Hotel Franchising segment licenses its lodging brands and provides related services to third-party hotel owners and others. The Hotel Management segment provides full-service international managed business services.\n\nWhile Wyndham didn\u2019t produce the most outstanding financial results ever, it certainly impressed with its consistent performance last year. Therefore, investors are looking for more of the same; basically, a steady-as-she-goes profile. In fiscal 2023, the company beat per-share profitability expectations. Subsequently, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 3.9%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts forecast that EPS will land on average at $4.24 atop sales of $1.46 billion. Moreover, the most optimistic estimate calls for EPS of $4.38 on revenue of $1.52 billion. For context, Wyndham posted per-share profits of $4.01 on revenue of $1.4 billion last year.\n\nCovering experts peg WYNN a consensus moderate buy with a $116.82 average price target. The high-side target stands at $135.\n\nCarnival (CCL) Carnival (CCL) logo sign in the night at their headquarters in Miami, Florida, USA. Carnival Cruise Line is an international cruise line.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s most recognizable travel stocks to buy, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) engages in the provision of travel services in North America, Australia, Europe, and Asia. Per its public profile, Carnival operates through four segments: NAA Cruise Operations, Europe Cruise Operations, Cruise Support, and Tour and Other. It also operates port destinations, private islands, and a solar park, along with hotels and other travel-related properties.\n\nAfter suffering through a calamitous crisis in the form of Covid-19, Carnival has come back strong in 2023. Most notably, for its fiscal Q4, the company mitigated an expected per-share loss of 13 cents by losing \u201conly\u201d 7 cents. And in Q3, it posted EPS of 86 cents, beating out the consensus view of 75 cents. Overall, the average surprise came out to 19.5% last year.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts believe that Carnival will post EPS of $1.01 on sales of $24.69 billion. Further, the most optimistic estimate calls for EPS of $1.20 on sales of just over $25 billion. Last year, Carnival broke even on per-share profits and printed revenue of $21.59 billion.\n\nAnalysts rate CCL a moderate buy with a $19.73 average price target.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The front view of a passenger airplane with a sunset in the background. Airline stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAn air transportation specialist, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) also ranks among the top travel stocks to buy in terms of popularity. Per its corporate profile, United transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional fleets. It also offers catering, ground handling, flight academy and maintenance services for third parties.\n\nAlthough the air travel industry faced many questions last year, overall, United has impressed when it mattered the most. Last fiscal year, the company beat analysts expected earnings target (or in the case of Q1 mitigated the expected loss per share). Overall, the average surprise for the last four quarters came out to 16.45%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts believe that United will generate EPS of $9.51 on sales of $57.25 billion. The high-side estimate calls for EPS of $10.39 on sales of $58.6 billion. In 2023, the company posted per-share profits of $10.05 and a top line of $53.72 billion.\n\nUAL carries a moderate buy consensus view with a $58.93 average price target. For speculators, it could be one of the more compelling travel stocks to buy.\n\nDine Brands (DIN) din stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAn intriguing albeit speculative idea for travel stocks to buy, Dine Brands (NYSE:DIN) owns, franchises and operates restaurants in the U.S. and internationally. It operates via six segments, including its two most famous brands Applebee\u2019s and International House of Pancakes (IHOP). Over the past 52 weeks, DIN stock suffered a decline of 31% of equity value.\n\nTo be sure, the restaurant industry has suffered significantly due to pressures against discretionary consumer spending. So, why target DIN stock? Fundamentally, I believe that travelers will be more inclined to save money wherever they can. Therefore, eating at modestly priced restaurants like Applebee\u2019s and IHOP could be the order of the day.\n\nMoreover, the company beat earnings expectations in the last four quarters. Indeed, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 16.65%. That\u2019s impressive amid sector-wide headwinds.\u00a0 For the current fiscal year, analysts project EPS to reach $6.51 on sales of $843.23 million. Last year, EPS pinged at $6.65 on sales of $831.07 million.\n\nDine Brands carries a strong buy rating with a $60.60 price target. While risky, the implied 31% upside potential could entice market gamblers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Finding undervalued bargains is challenging in the current economic environment. Since the beginning of the year, the market has been highly volatile and the trajectory of interest rates is uncertain, yet stocks are at an all-time high. The current Shiller PE ratio for the S&P 500 is at 35 against historical averages of around 17, and the Buffett Indicator is 184.70%, suggesting the market is heavily overbought. While glowing reports of unexpected profits and predictions of a soft landing occurred in the third quarter of 2023 to boost investor optimism, analysts caution investors to stay conservative. The January inflation report exemplifies that sentiment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with VICI.\n\nOne hidden gem is VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI), a real estate investment trust that focuses on the gaming, hospitality, entertainment and leisure businesses. The stock has garnered positive analyst reviews with an average broker recommendation of outperform. As of March 8, GuruFocus lists the stock as moderately undervalued selling at a discount of 28.60% and gives it a GF Score of 89 out of 100 and a value score of 10 out of 10. The stock has an annual forward dividend yield of 5.62% and is currently trading at $29.12. VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market\n\nIndustry and competitive landscape\n\nThe Gaming REIT sector, also known as the Casino REIT sector, is a relatively new area of real estate companies that lease land or properties to businesses focused on casinos, resorts, hotels and racetracks. The gaming REIT sector was created in 2013 with the development of Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. (NASDAQ:GLPI), the first entrant into the space. The second entrant, MGM Growth Properties (MGP), went public in 2016 and VICI Properties became public in 2018. VICI acquired MGM Growth Properties in April 2022, reducing the public playing field to two companies. Gaming and Leisure Properties is the only pure-play publicly traded REIT in the gaming space. VICI Properties refers to itself as an experiential REIT. In addition to its gaming properties, comprising approximately 57% of its portfolio, VICI owns properties tied to four golf courses (operated by CDN Golf Management, an affiliate of Cabot) and 39 bowling alleys (operated by Bowlero.)\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackstone Real Estate Investment Trust, a non-traded REIT and part of Blackstone's (NYSE:BX) product line, entered the gaming REIT space in 2019 when Blackstone acquired the real estate assets of the Bellagio from MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM). The following year, BREIT formed a joint venture with MGM Growth Properties to purchase the property assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay. BREIT further expanded its position on the Las Vegas Strip through net-lease investments with the Cosmopolitan and the Bellagio. However, more recently, the REIT appears to be divesting gaming assets, as indicated by the sale of its stakes in MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay property assets to VICI in December 2022. BREIT also sold assets in the Bellagio to Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) in August of 2023. Currently, gaming property assets comprise approximately 5% of BREIT's portfolio.\n\nIn addition to the Bellagio property, Realty Income bought the property assets for Encore Boston Harbor from the Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) in February 2022. Combined with the Bellagio transaction, Realty Income's gaming property assets comprise approximately 3.90% of its portfolio. VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market\n\nIn-person gambling still dominates the industry with enthusiasts citing the draw of the emersion experience of social interactions with other gamblers and immediate access to winnings; however, online betting appears to be encroaching on the space as in-person gambling comprised 75.30% of revenue during 2023 versus 80.50% in 2022.\n\nSpinoff origins\n\nBoth VICI and Gaming and Leisure Properties were created as spinoffs in which the property assets of gaming operators were spun off into REITS that leased those assets back to the original companies. VICI was created in 2017 when it purchased the property assets of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (NASDAQ:CZR) as part of the latter company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Gaming and Leisure Properties was created in 2013 when it was spun off from Penn National Gaming. Spinoff tactics were also used in the BREIT/MGM Growth Properties and BREIT/Realty Income transactions mentioned above.\n\nGaming REITS typically use triple net lease models, in which the tenant (also known as the gaming operations company) is responsible for real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance costs in addition to costs for rent and utilities. This agreement provides tenants with generally lower rents and direct control over the rental properties while providing investors with low-risk and steady income streams.\n\nOn the other hand, sale-leaseback arrangements enable gaming operators to sell their property assets to REITS to raise capital and lighten their asset bases. Operators are then required to lease the sold property back from the REIT.\n\nInvestor sentiment toward gaming REITS\n\nSince VICI's inception, investors have been more receptive toward gaming REITS than they have been toward the greater real estate market, which has received downward pressure due to vacancy rates of office REITS and other sectors after the Covid-19 pandemic and the rising interest rate environment. The gaming REIT sector has outpaced the wider REIT market by nearly 2 times; however, the sector has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by over the same amount. The chart below illustrates the share performance of VICI and Gaming and Leisure Properties against the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (VNQ) (a proxy for the general REIT market) and the S&P 500 Index (^GSPC). VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market\n\nVICI Data by GuruFocus\n\nVICI's capital allocation pros and cons\n\nVICI was saddled with over $2 billion in debt when it emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company. The company faced resistance from both investors and lenders when raising capital. The board selection process addressed these concerns by recruiting individuals with hospitality, gaming and REIT experience. The board also faced the challenges of deleveraging a debt-laden balance sheet, reliance on only one tenant, building competent management and developing governance practices that balanced action with risk management. According to Board Chair James Abrahamson:\n\n\"We did not have the time or the capacity to develop or execute a risk-free strategy. We needed to quickly establish a strong board culture, sound governance practices, and a highly effective board-management relationship that could act decisively and quickly to fix our problems and seize every opportunity we could generate.\"\n\nThe board selected hospitality industry REIT veteran Edward Pitoniak as CEO, who, in turn, chose an executive team with the expertise needed for governance of the newly created REIT.\n\nPitoniak first addressed VICI's pre-initial public offering debt levels, which were 10.50 times its expected first year, by meeting with prospective investors and discovering their willingness to accept debt-for-equity swaps that reduced the debt to 8.50 times Ebita; however, Pitoniak concluded that VICI would need to further reduce the ratio by growing Ebita for a viable IPO.\n\nConcurrently, Ceasar approached VICI about purchasing Harrah's Las Vegas for $1.10 billion. To finance this transaction, VICI's management opted for investor equity dilution through a debt-for-equity swap rather than derailing the initial deleveraging goal. It also circumvented a bid by MGM Properties in early 2018. (Ironically, MGM Properties was later bought by VICI in 2021 for $17.2 billion.) VICI's over-equitization strategy allowed the company to deleverage its balance sheet as it grew through the acquisition of prime real estate assets on the Las Vegas Strip and achieve 100% rent collection rates while the company's tenets struggled through Covid-19, but were reluctant to forfeit their Las Vegas locations by defaulting on rental fees. VICI also achieved a $30 billion market capitalization and an investment-grade debt rating within five years after emerging from bankruptcy. The company's current rating is BBB-, as reviewed by both Moody's and Fitch. The company also has maintained good control over debt levels. VICI currently has a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of 0.70 and a current ratio of 28.22.\n\nOn the flip side, the strategy has also served to drag down shareholder yield. VICI's practice of issuing shares is reflected in the chart below. Its three-year buyback ratio is -24.80 and its shareholders' yield as of December 2023 is -18.77% versus Gaming and Leisure's three-year buyback ratio of -5.20 and shareholder yield of 2.18%. VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market\n\nVICI has a long-term goal to keep its debt-to-Ebitda ratio between 5 and 5.50, which it is currently meeting; but this ratio has fluctuated from a low of 3 to as high as 12.82 in the last five years and is trending upward. VICI Properties: A Value Grab in an Overpriced Market\n\nVICI's moat on the Las Vegas Strip\n\nVICI's draw for investors over Gaming and Leisure Properties is demonstrated not only in terms of strong financial health, revenue growth and operating cash flow, but also in terms of its Las Vegas Strip property assets. The master lease for the Venetian, its largest tenant in terms of square footage, includes the Palazzo, Venetian Expo and Convention Center and the MSG Sphere. VICI also owns the Caesars Forum Convention Center behind the Linq. Overall, VICI owns approximately 660 acres of land covering 10 resorts on the strip. In addition to VICI's developed properties, it also owns 33 acres of undeveloped land on and near the strip that provides ample development and expansion opportunities.\n\nProperty Owner Property Tenant Lease TotalSq.Ft.

The company's board of directors and shrewd management are credited with helping the company emerge from a challenging situation tied to the bankruptcy of a prominent Las Vegas casino operator to becoming a promising performer with historic growth rates. The challenge moving forward will be to continue the trek of strategic growth while maximizing shareholder value. VICI's current fundamentals are solid, but I would like to see a limit on the number of additional shares issued moving forward and focus on the development of current assets.\n\nPlease note that I am not a financial advisor, and this article is intended only for informative purposes and should not be construed as investment advice.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) share price has gained 17% in the last three months. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. After all, the share price is down 25% in the last three years, significantly under-performing the market.\n\nWhile the stock has risen 3.3% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nWynn Resorts became profitable within the last five years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. So given the share price is down it's worth checking some other metrics too.\n\nWith a rather small yield of just 1.0% we doubt that the stock's share price is based on its dividend. We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 32% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. It's probably worth investigating Wynn Resorts further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity.\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWynn Resorts is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Wynn Resorts in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWynn Resorts shareholders are down 3.9% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.7% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 13, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix Inc. NFLX, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Carnival Corp. & plc CCL, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL and Wynn Resorts Ltd. WYNN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy in a Slow-Moving March\n\nWall Street has moved mostly sideways so far in March after rallying strongly for the first two months of 2024. Month to date, the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, while the S&P 500 is up 0.4%. However, sector and stock-specific activities are in full swing.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.\n\nThe U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 7, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.5% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession.\n\nMeanwhile, personal income increased unexpectedly by 1% in January compared with the consensus estimate as well as December's reading of 0.3%. Personal consumption expenditure increased 0.2% in January in line with the consensus estimate.\n\nMoreover, the sector is generally recognized as being growth-oriented. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of the market interest rate and are inversely related. Recently Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his testimony before the Senate after appearing before the House of Representatives a day before.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Mar 6, Powell said the central bank is likely to initiate interest rate cuts this year but not any time soon. However, on Mar 7, he indicated that interest rate cuts may not be too far off if the inflation rate moves in line with the Fed's expectations in the near future.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNetflix Inc. added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Netflix forecasts revenues of $9.24 billion, reflecting growth of 13.2% year over year or 12% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis.

        "title": "Buy 5 Consumer Discretionary Stocks in a Slowly Moving March",
        "content": "Wall Street has moved mostly sideways so far in March after rallying strongly for the first two months of 2024. Month to date, the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively, while the S&P 500 is up 0.4%. However, sector and stock-specific activities are in full swing.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector comprises businesses that sell goods and services that are considered non-essential by consumers. These are the products that consumers can avoid without any major consequences to their well-being. In fact, these goods are desirable only if the available income of an individual is sufficient to purchase them.\n\nThe U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%. On Mar 7, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker forecast a 2.5% growth rate for first-quarter 2024, indicating, no chance of a near-term recession.\n\nMeanwhile, personal income increased unexpectedly by 1% in January compared with the consensus estimate as well as December\u2019s reading of 0.3%. Personal consumption expenditure increased 0.2% in January in line with the consensus estimate.\n\nMoreover, the sector is generally recognized as being growth-oriented. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of the market interest rate and are inversely related. Recently Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his testimony before the Senate after appearing before the House of Representatives a day before.\n\nOn Mar 6, Powell said the central bank is likely to initiate interest rate cuts this year but not any time soon. However, on Mar 7, he indicated that interest rate cuts may not be too far off if the inflation rate moves in line with the Fed\u2019s expectations in the near future.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have strong growth potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revision in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

        "content": "The U.S. economy is on solid ground as inflation, although above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, has declined sharply. The Commerce Department, in its second and final estimate, said last week that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew a solid 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 driven by robust consumer spending.\n\nAlthough growth in the fourth quarter was lower than the third quarter\u2019s growth of 4.9%, the economy is still advancing at a rapid pace as price pressures continue to ease and raise hopes of a softer landing than expected earlier.\n\nMoreover, GDP growth has now topped more than 2% for six consecutive quarters. Overall expansion in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product was 2.3% in 2023, higher than the 1.9% recorded in the preceding year.\n\nInflation declined sharply from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to around 3.1% in January 2024, which eased price pressures, allowing consumers to spend more freely. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the overall economic activity in the nation, advanced a solid 3% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlso, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred gauge of inflation, eased substantially in the fourth quarter. The PCE index climbed just 1.8% in the final quarter of 2023. Core PCE, which excludes the volatile energy and food prices, rose 2.1% in the fourth quarter.\n\nPrice pressures are expected to ease further in the coming days. The Federal Reserve has also indicated multiple interest rate cuts in 2024, with the first expected in May or June. Markets are now pricing in a 55.4% chance that the Federal Reserve will go for the first 25-basis points rate cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nAlso, the International Monetary Fund projects the U.S. economy to grow at an annualized pace of 2.1% in 2024, a lot higher than its forecast for other major economies.\n\nOur Choices\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks such as Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN, Interface, Inc. TILE, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Netflix, Inc NFLX, which have strong potential for 2024.

Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\u00a0You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nWynn Resorts, Limited together with its subsidiaries, is a leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts.

        "title": "These 2 Consumer Discretionary Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar",
        "content": "Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\n\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. AMC Entertainment (AMC) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.65 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on February 28, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the -$0.65 Most Accurate Estimate and the -$0.70 Zacks Consensus Estimate, AMC Entertainment has an Earnings ESP of 6.67%.\n\nAMC is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Wynn Resorts (WYNN).\n\nWynn Resorts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 14, 2024. WYNN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.43 a share 77 days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Wynn Resorts, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 is 5.65%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC and WYNN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks to Make Retirement a Piece of Cake",
        "content": "As the markets hit new highs to start the year, some investors might be looking to grow their passive income from their investments. When finding the right dividend stocks to buy, investors can usually not go wrong sticking with industry-leading companies that have been around for years.\n\nThat said, let's look at why three Motley Fool contributors believe Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and Realty Income(NYSE: O) are great income stocks to buy right now.\n\nAn outstanding record of dividend growth\n\nJohn Ballard (Coca-Cola): Successful dividend investing is all about looking for a track record of sustainability. Coca-Cola has been around since 1886, and it has increased the quarterly dividend for 63 consecutive years. The stock currently offers a yield of 3.17%, higher than the consumer-staples average of 1.89%.\n\nCoke benefits from a large portfolio of brands spanning carbonated beverages, juices, and tea. The power of these brands translates to massive sales volumes every year, where over 2.2 billion servings of its beverage products are consumed globally every year. That makes it an ideal dividend stock to boost the average yield of your investment portfolio.\n\nInvestors can expect the dividend to keep growing. With several international markets still in the developing stages of spreading more soft-drink consumption, Coke's unit sales volume probably has a long runway of growth ahead. That's one reason management believes it can achieve 4% to 6% top-line growth and 7% to 9% earnings growth on an annualized basis.\n\nThe shares are fairly valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.7. When we combine the stock's 3%-plus yield on top of high-single-digit earnings growth potential, investors can expect to earn a low double-digit annualized return on their investment over the long term.\n\nDon't be fooled by the slowdown\n\nJeremy Bowman (Home Depot): Home Depot has dominated the home-improvement retail industry for a generation, and it shows little sign of giving up its leadership.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for Home Depot's products, including raw materials such as lumber, power tools, gardening supplies, appliances, and fixtures, isn't going anywhere, and much of its business is Amazon-proof, with high barriers to entry.\n\nThe company should also benefit in the coming years from a shortage of housing, as some economists estimate that the U.S. needs an additional 4 million homes to reach market equilibrium and satisfy demand. The company estimates its addressable home improvement retail market to be worth $950 billion.\n\nRecent results at Home Depot haven't been encouraging, since the housing market has been cyclically weak. The company just wrapped up a year in which comparable sales were down 3.2% and revenue fell 3%. That weighed on the bottom line, as earnings per share were down 9.5% to $15.11.\n\nCEO Ted Decker described 2023 as a year of moderation, and management expects similar headwinds in 2024, calling for revenue growth of just 1%, which includes the benefit of a 53rd week, and a 1% increase in EPS.\n\nHowever, Home Depot should return to steady growth once interest rates fall and the housing market strengthens. The company also remains a dividend stalwart. It just declared its 148th consecutive quarterly dividend, a streak dating to the early days of the business. It currently offers a 2.3% dividend yield and has a history of strong dividend increases, typically in the double-digit percentages.\n\nIf you're looking for a dividend stock to count in retirement, Home Depot looks like a great choice, with its resilient business model and history of dividend hikes, and now looks like a good buying opportunity, with the stock in a cyclical downturn.\n\nGet a reliable monthly check with this standout REIT\n\nJennifer Saibil (Realty Income): Every retirement account should have some real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks, and Realty Income stands out as one of the best. It has everything a dividend investor should be looking for: a high yield, a proven track record of dividend increases, and reliability. It also has something most other dividend stock can't boast: It pays monthly.\n\nREITs are a class of stocks that own properties, typically of a specific type. They pay out 90% of their income as dividends, which is why they're great for passive income. Realty Income is a retail REIT, and it leases space to large chain retailers such as Walmart(NYSE: WMT) and Lowe's(NYSE: LOW). It's made two large acquisitions over the past two years and made several sale-leaseback deals that have added thousands of new properties to its total, and it has expanded into new areas such as gaming, with a sale-leaseback arrangement with Wynn Resorts(NASDAQ: WYNN).\n\nIt's highly diversified, with 1,326 tenants in 86 industries. However, 81% are in retail. Its largest industries and tenants are resilient businesses, and it consistently reports occupancy rates near 100%.\n\nRealty Income stock is down 21% over the past year because of the suppressed real estate market. But Realty Income is well capitalized to buy more properties, and it reported adjusted funds from operations of $4 in 2023, up from $3.92 the year before. It's managing well through the real estate turbulence and is well positioned to keep it up for the foreseeable future.\n\nAt this price, Realty Income's dividend yields 5.6%. It has paid a dividend for 644 months consecutively -- that's more than 53 years -- with 105 quarterly increases. It's adding properties and income and sees a large opportunity ahead, and it's a top pick for reliable passive income.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Decoding Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) demonstrates resilience with a strong recovery in Macau operations post-pandemic. Strategic expansion and innovation remain at the forefront of WYNN's growth agenda. WYNN faces intense competition and geopolitical risks that could impact future performance. Commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility strengthens WYNN's brand reputation.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with WYNN.\n\nOn February 23, 2024, Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic direction. As a premier operator of luxury casinos and resorts, WYNN has shown a commendable recovery in its Macau operations, with gaming revenues bouncing back to $22.7 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the pandemic-stricken figures. The Las Vegas operations also reported increased gaming revenues and visitation, indicating a robust rebound in the tourism and gaming sectors. Wynn Resorts continues to innovate, with plans to open a new building next to Wynn Palace around 2028 and a phased development adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor expected to open in 2026. Despite these positive developments, WYNN faces stiff competition and must navigate geopolitical tensions that could affect consumer spending and travel. The company's commitment to sustainability, as evidenced by its investments in renewable energy and corporate social responsibility initiatives, enhances its reputation and aligns with modern stakeholder expectations. Decoding Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Prestige and Luxury Experience: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) has established itself as a symbol of luxury and exclusivity in the hospitality and gaming industry. The company's resorts are synonymous with high-end amenities and superior customer service, which have been instrumental in attracting a premium clientele. This brand prestige is underpinned by numerous awards and recognitions, including high rankings in the luxury hotel category. Wynn's focus on artistry and championship craftsmanship has set its properties apart, creating a unique and memorable experience for guests. The company's strategic emphasis on service-driven culture and excellence has not only fostered customer loyalty but also enhanced its competitive positioning in the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic Geographic Presence: Wynn Resorts' strategic locations in key tourist destinations like Macau and Las Vegas have been a major strength. The Macau operations, in particular, benefit from being part of one of the world's largest concentrations of potential gaming and tourism customers. With the recent renewal of the gaming concession contract for another 10 years, Wynn Macau SA is well-positioned to capitalize on the region's growth. The Las Vegas operations also enjoy a prime position in the largest gaming market in the United States, with Wynn Las Vegas and Encore contributing significantly to the company's revenue streams. These strategic locations, coupled with Wynn's reputation for luxury, position the company to continue capturing a significant share of the high-end gaming and tourism market.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Limited Number of Properties: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates a relatively small number of properties, which could be seen as a weakness. This concentration means that the company's financial performance is heavily reliant on the success and stability of a few key resorts. Any adverse events affecting these locations, such as regulatory changes, economic downturns, or other disruptions, could have a disproportionate impact on Wynn's overall financial health. Additionally, the company's ability to generate cash flow and pay dividends is contingent on the performance of these properties, which adds an element of risk for investors.\n\nGeopolitical Sensitivities and Regulatory Risks: Wynn Resorts' operations are sensitive to geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes, particularly in Macau, which is governed as a special administrative region of China. Changes in visa policies, travel restrictions, or diplomatic relations can significantly affect visitation and spending patterns at Wynn's properties. The gaming industry in Macau has previously experienced volatility due to such factors, and Wynn's reliance on this market exposes it to potential fluctuations in revenue. Moreover, the company must navigate complex regulatory environments in all its locations, which requires constant vigilance and adaptability to ensure compliance and maintain its gaming licenses.\n\nOpportunities\n\nExpansion and Diversification: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) has significant opportunities for expansion and diversification. The company's planned developments, such as the new building next to Wynn Palace and the phased development adjacent to Encore Boston Harbor, are poised to enhance its portfolio and attract new customer segments. These projects are expected to introduce additional gaming facilities, entertainment venues, and other amenities that will drive growth. Furthermore, Wynn's investment in a new integrated resort property in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, signals its intention to diversify geographically and tap into new markets, potentially mitigating risks associated with its current geographic concentration.\n\nRecovery and Growth in Post-Pandemic Era: As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wynn Resorts is well-positioned to benefit from the resurgence in global travel and tourism. The lifting of travel restrictions and the return of consumer confidence are likely to result in increased visitation and spending across Wynn's properties. The company's strong brand and reputation for luxury could attract high-net-worth individuals looking for premium experiences, providing a significant opportunity for revenue growth. Additionally, Wynn's commitment to health and safety measures will be crucial in reassuring guests and maintaining its position as a destination of choice in the post-pandemic landscape.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition and Market Saturation: Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates in an industry characterized by intense competition. The company faces challenges from a multitude of high-quality resorts that compete on various fronts, including amenities,\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 High Growth Consumer Stocks to Buy.\n\nConsumer stocks include stocks across two sectors that include companies offering products and services directly to consumers. The consumer staples sector provides essential products and services that are used by consumers on a daily basis. It includes food and beverages, household goods, hygiene products, and personal items, among others. On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector provides non-essential goods and services including automobiles, luxury goods, and leisure items, among others.\n\nThe nature of products and services provided by the respective sectors significantly impacts the top and bottom lines for the companies providing these goods and services. Consumer Staples, with the provision of essential goods and services, has a more stable and robust top and bottom line as its demand remains relatively stable even in times of macroeconomic instability. On the other hand, customers tend to cut down their expenditures when it comes to consumer discretionary items when adverse macroeconomic situations persist.\n\nThe consumer staples sector faced challenges in the past year as the companies had to face rising inflation as well as increasing competition from private-label companies in the sector. The consumer staples sector benefits from attractive valuations as the stocks in the sector lost favor last year when investors flocked to mega-tech stocks. Attractive valuations, improving profit margins, and strong pricing power may translate into a positive year for the big names in the sector, according to Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager.\n\nOn the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector depicted resilience in the face of these challenges as pent up demand from previous years kept overall demand stable during 2023. According to Jordan Michaels, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, the consumer discretionary sector is expected to continue to perform well this year as well, supported by interest rate cuts, lower inflation rates, and industry-wide factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur list of 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy includes some of the most notable names in the consumer sectors and is dominated by companies from the consumer discretionary sector as these companies managed to grow their revenues significantly despite the incumbent macroeconomic adversity. These companies have benefited from multiple factors recently. For instance, Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) significantly increased their production recently which has translated into high revenue growth. Similarly, the list includes multiple resorts and casino operators such as Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) which have benefited from the resurgence of the travel and leisure industry.\n\nA supermarket shelf overflowing with a variety of fast-moving consumer goods.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo come up with 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy, we have used stock screeners to identify high growth consumer stocks. We filtered the stocks with at least $2.0 billion in market capitalization and a year-over-year revenue growth of more than 30% for the latest quarter, as of February 9. We then proceeded to rank the companies in ascending order of their revenue growth.\n\nWe have also provided hedge fund ownership data for the stocks on our list. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2023 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n14. Hims & Hers Health, Inc.

(NYSE:HIMS) also announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50 million worth of the company\u2019s common stock over the next 2 years.\n\nLike other stocks such as Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD), and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (NYSE:HIMS) is among the 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy.\n\n13. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

The company\u2019s revenue increased by nearly 57% y-o-y to $2.5 billion in Q3 2023.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, 31 of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:NCLH), holding shares worth $397 million. Its largest hedge fund shareholder was John W. Rogers\u2019 Ariel Investments with ownership of 6.3 million shares valued at $126 million.\n\n12.

(NASDAQ:DKNG) announced that it had submitted an indicative offer to acquire the U.S. business of PointsBet Holdings Ltd. for an all-cash purchase price of $195 million. The proposal represented a 30% premium to PointsBet\u2019s existing agreement to sell the business to Fanatics Betting and Gaming. The company later announced that it is no longer pursuing the acquisition.\n\nAs of Q4 2023, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) shares were owned by 55 of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, the second highest on our list of 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy.\n\nBaron Funds, an investment management company, made the following comments about DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) in its \u201cBaron Discovery Fund\u201d\u00a0Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to our position in DraftKings Inc., the leading mobile sportsbook and gaming operator in the U.S. While we lowered our estimates for the fourth quarter due to lower hold in the month of November, it is important to keep in mind that while hold can be volatile from quarter to quarter, the company continues to slowly increase hold over time (primarily because of a higher percentage of the handle being in higher hold \u201cparlay\u201d bets). We continue to be attracted to DraftKing\u2019s dominant market share and the scale advantages that come with this.\u201d\n\n11. TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL)\n\nRevenue Growth YoY: 60.51%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nBased in Beijing, China, TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL) is a leading education and technology company operating in China.

We believe additional drivers for future value creation beyond a re-emergence in Macau business activity include: (i) our expectation for long-term growth opportunities in the company\u2019s U.S.-centric markets of Las Vegas and Boston, including an expansion of Wynn\u2019s Encore Boston Harbor resort; (ii) Wynn\u2019s plans to develop an integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates with 1,500 hotel rooms and a casino that is similar in size to that of Encore Boston Harbor; (iii) opportunities to improve cash-flow margins by rightsizing labor and achieving lower staff costs in Macau; (iv) the possibility that Wynn is granted a New York casino license; and (v) an expansion in the company\u2019s valuation multiple to levels achieved prior to the pandemic.\u201d\n\n9. e.l.f.

PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD)\n\nRevenue Growth YoY: 93.89%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 71\n\nShanghai, China-based PDD Holdings Inc.

It has built a network of sourcing, logistics, and fulfillment capabilities, that support its underlying businesses.

The company ranks highest on our list of 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy based on the number of hedge funds that own its shares.\n\nIn its Q4 2024 investor letter, GreenWood Investors LLC, an investment management firm, made the following comments about PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD):\n\n\u201cUsing insights gleaned from our close proximity to e-commerce at CTT, we undertook a multi-month effort to underwrite PDD Holdings. This US-listed Irish holding company owns China\u2019s leading disruptive marketplace called PinDuoDuo. During the summer, as it became unbearable for most investors to remain publicly invested in Chinese equities, we took a position in PDD. Adding to the narrative during the summer for PDD was that its international business, Temu, was burning cash and carried with it a negative valuation consolidated into PDD\u2019s holding company structure. Yet, as we were able to validate the major competitive advantage its direct-selling model has, from Chinese factory direct to the global consumer, we understood the losses to be highly temporary as the company leaned into digital marketing \u2014 becoming by far the largest digital advertiser on all leading platforms.\u201d\n\n6.

        "content": "Introduces Eight-Member Slate with Deep Experience in Governance, Finance, Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, Strategic Transformations, Transportation and the Railroad Sector\n\nProposes Jim Barber, a Proven Transportation Network Leader and Former Executive at UPS, as CEO and Jamie Boychuk, a Career Railroader and Former Executive at CSX, as COO\n\nIntroduces \"Network of the Future\" Strategy Offering Path to Significant Value Creation\n\nReleases Presentation Entitled \"The Case for Leadership, Safety and Strategy Changes at Norfolk Southern\" That is Downloadable at www.MoveNSCForward.com\n\nCLEVELAND, February 20, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ohio-based Ancora Holdings Group, LLC, its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, the \"Investor Group\" or \"we\"), who collectively own a large equity stake in Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) (\"Norfolk Southern\" or the \"Company\"), today announced the nomination of eight highly qualified, independent candidates (the \"Investor Slate\") for election to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\"). In addition, the Investor Group announced it has identified a proposed management team that includes transportation network leader Jim Barber, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and lifelong railroad operator and turnaround expert Jamie Boychuk as Chief Operating Officer. To learn more about the Investor Slate and proposed management team, download a copy of the Investor Group\u2019s presentation, entitled The Case for Leadership, Safety and Strategy Changes at Norfolk Southern, at www.MoveNSCForward.com.\n\nThe Investor Group commented:\n\n\"Norfolk Southern, which has exceptional rail workers and the country\u2019s best customers, has suffered for years due to its Board\u2019s poor decisions with regard to the Company\u2019s leadership, safety priorities and strategy. Since the Board announced its appointment of Alan Shaw as Chief Executive Officer, Norfolk Southern\u2019s status as the worst Class I railroad has been solidified by leadership delivering industry-worst operating results, sustained share price underperformance and a tone-deaf response to the devastating East Palestine, Ohio derailment. The future looks equally bleak under Mr. Shaw, who has drawn the condemnation of policymakers and the skepticism of underwhelmed analysts and shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn recent months, we engaged in good faith and shared a data-centric, facts-based case for meaningful change with Norfolk Southern\u2019s Board. We privately conveyed, on several occasions, that Mr. Shaw\u2019s strategy is equal parts unambitious and impractical (despite somehow having the unanimous backing of the Board). Moreover, we privately showed that Mr. Shaw\u2019s background as a 30-year insider with a poor record of driving growth through marketing roles renders him unfit to get a second chance as Chief Executive Officer. We even met with Mr. Shaw in hopes of having him change our view. While all this was going on, however, Norfolk Southern was sending its private jet to Washington, D.C. so executives could pursue the support of regulators and the Company started requesting public support from customers as part of its planned fight against us.\n\nThe bottom line is that it is time to actually move Norfolk Southern forward. Moving ahead starts with identifying the right destination. Our slate and proposed management team believe they have the experience and strategy required to turn Norfolk Southern into a safer, more sustainable railroad that is growing profitably while also yielding more stability for customers and employees. As shown in our presentation, this is a far cry from where Norfolk Southern stands today under Mr. Shaw and his loyal backers in the boardroom. In the coming weeks, we look forward to sharing a second presentation that focuses on our 100-day transition plan and the details of our reliable network strategy that will leverage Norfolk Southern\u2019s existing assets and people to get the organization to the right destination. We will show that a better day is in reach \u2013 one that includes enhanced value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders.\"\n\nINVESTOR SLATE BIOS\n\nBetsy Atkins\n\nMs. Atkins is a corporate governance expert and three-time CEO with experience in capital allocation, transformations and strategic planning.\n\nCEO and Founder of Baja Corporation, a venture capital firm focused on software, technology, energy and digital transformation.\n\nMember of the boards of directors of SL Green Realty (NYSE: SLG), SolarEdge Technologies (Nasdaq: SEDG), Enovix Corporation (Nasdaq: ENVX), Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN), Rackspace Technology (Nasdaq: RXT) and GoPuff.\n\nFormer CEO and Chair of SaaS Company Clear Standards, an energy management and sustainability software company, CEO and Chair of NCI, a functional food/nutraceutical company, and CEO of Key Supercomputer Labs, which delivers technology-driven seismic analytics and sustainability insights.\n\nPreviously served on the board of directors of companies that include Covetrus, Schneider Electric, HD Supply and Volvo Car Corporation.\n\nJim Barber, Jr.\n\nMr. Barber is a shipping and logistics industry veteran with experience in finance, strategic planning and risk management at one of the country\u2019s largest railroad customers.\n\nPreviously spent 35 years at United Parcel Service, Inc.

        "title": "Las Vegas Sands Set to Ride Macao Recovery",
        "content": "With Macao showing signs of a recovery, it may be time to take a closer look at Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), which is a pure play on the Asian gaming markets.\n\nCompany profile\n\nLas Vegas Sands is a developer and operator of casino, entertainment and retail mall properties, primarily in Asia. Its integrated resorts feature gaming, entertainment, conference facilities, hotels and expansive shopping and restaurant options. The company caters to mass market and VIP guests.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with LVS.\n\nIt owns 69.9% of Sands China, which operates in the Macao region of China. Sands China owns The Venetian Macao, The Londoner Macao, The Parisian Macao and the Four Seasons/Plaza Casino on the Cotai Strip, as well as the Sand Macao off the strip. It also has ferry and other operations in the area.\n\nOutside of China, Las Vegas Sands also owns the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore. The resort opened with 2,600 rooms and 160,000 square feet of gaming space, a dining and entertain complex, a theater, convention space and even an art and science museum.\n\nThe company previously sold off its properties in Las Vegas.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nThe biggest opportunity for Las Vegas Sands is a return to pre-pandemic tourism levels in Macao. The Chinese Covid lockdown dampened travel to the gaming hotspot, and the Macao market is still recovering.\n\nMacao did see some nice improvements in the fourth quarter, with visits from China, excluding the bordering Guangdong Province, reaching 2.61. million visits. That was about 86% the level of visits in fourth-quarter 2019 before Covid hit. Total visitations, meanwhile, reached 8.30 million, about 90% of the level of the pre-pandemic traffic, when there were 9.30 millon people who visited the gaming mecca. This is despite airport seat capacity at only 81% of 2019 levels in December at the Macao Airport. Mass gaming revenue in Macao, meanwhile, hit $5.90 billion, which was 5% above 2019 levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Sands China, the mass market returned close to 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. However, high rollers have been slow to come back to its properties. Rolling volume, which measures VIP play, was $6 billion in the quarter, only 40% of 2019 levels. Meanwhile, its roll win percentage of 2.16% was below expectations, hurting its Ebitda by $40 million in the quarter. As a result, its Macao segment Ebitda was $654 million, down from $811 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. That represents a lot of Ebitda it has the potential to get back in the coming years.\n\nNow one way Las Vegas Sands is looking to lure back high rollers and gamers in general is to invest in its properties. The biggest investment is being directed towards its Londoner Macao property. The company has already completed Phase 1 of its investments in the property, including opening its ultra-VIP hotel the Londoner Court. Phase two started in November and is expected to be completed by Chinese New Year 2025. The $1.20 billion project will include the renovation and repositioning of the Sheraton and Conrad hotels, as well as the renovation of the Pacifica casino. New dining, entertainment, retail and wellness attractions will also be added.\n\nDiscussing the project on the fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Robert Goldstein said:\n\nI understand the market is concerned about London disruption. It's a valid point. However, two thoughts for you. One is that I think if the market continues to accelerate like we're seeing through January market numbers, perhaps we can overcome that by using other assets in the portfolio. But secondly, I think when you see the eventual transformation of Londoner, it will be a juggernaut on par with the Venetian or beyond. So, it gives us two assets we think can probably make $3 billion by themselves. And while there's disruption in '24, '25 and beyond gives us something that's unique in that market. The #1 and 2 assets are #1 and 1 assets in that market for years to come. So, there may be some disruption but maybe market force can overcome that, but I think the end result is well worth the pain.\n\nIn addition to upgrading the Londoner, Las Vegas Sands is also in the process of renovating and refurbishing its Marina Bay property in Singapore. The $1.75 billion project is being done in two phases and will see the hotel add 770 new suites and feature 1,850 redesigned rooms, as well as enhanced dining, premium gaming, entertainment and retail attractions. The project is expected to be completed by Chinese New Year 2025.\n\nNow with major renovations at two of of its major properties does come the risk of disruption. High-end gamblers want a luxury experience and do not want to deal with renovations. As such, there could be some near-term pressure on these properties during these transformations.\n\nAnother risk is Las Vegas Sands ties to China and the Asian markets. Gaming can be impacted by the economy, and China's economy has struggled coming out of the pandemic. Even its Singapore property still gets a lot of its traffic from mainland China.\n\nAs a U.S. company operating in China, Las Vegas Sands faces other risks as well. Tensions between the U.S. and China have been elevated in recent years, and there could be both government and consumer backlash. The gaming operator is all in on China at this point, so its risks are particularly elevated if tensions escalate any further.\n\nLas Vegas Sands also carries debt and ended 2023 at about 3 times leverage. Any disruptions to its business could cause this to become an issue. Meanwhile, it is looking to spend a fair amount on capital expenditure while improving its properties.\n\nThe company is also looking at an opportunity to potentially expand back into the U.S. The company is bidding for a license in New York and has said it is enthused by its prospects and that its bid is compelling. The company would look to build a $6 billion luxury casino and resort if it wins the license.\n\nValuation\n\nLas Vegas Sands trades at 9.30 times adjusted Ebitda based on 2024 analyst estimates of $5 billion. Based on the 2025 consensus of $5.40 billion, the stock trades at an 8.60 multiple.\n\nOn a price-earnings basis, it trades at 18.40 times the 2024 consensus of $2.70 and 16 times the 2025 consensus of $3.11.\n\nIt is projected to grow revenue by 17.50% in 2024 and 6.40% in 2025.\n\nCurrently, most casino stocks trade in the 8 to 10 times Ebitda range, with larger operators trading toward the high end of the range and regional operators towards the lower end of that range. And while casino operators like Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) have Macao properties in addition to their Las Vegas properties, Las Vegas Sands is one of the best pure plays on a recovery of the Chinese market.\n\nIt also carries less leverage than both Wynn Resorts and MGM, which have leverage of 4.50 times and 3.50 times, respectively, and generates plently of cash (over $2 bilion in operating cash flow) to fund its current renovation cycle. I would expect Macao to outperform Las Vegas given it is in the earlier stages of a recovery, and thus expect more growth potential from Las Vegas Sands as well.\n\nPre-pandemic, Las Vegas Sands' stock traded between 10 and 14 times enterprise value/Ebitda. That would give the stock a fair value range of between $60 and $89 based on 2025 Ebitda estimates.\n\nConclusion\n\nLas Vegas Sand is a strong play on a Macao recovery. Visitations are getting back to pre-pandemic levels and, in time, growth should surpass those levels. The Chinese gaming market in the past has shown strong growth, and if China follows the rest of the world after post-Covid lockdown behavior, there will be a lot more emphasis on experiences and travel, which will greatly benefit casino operators in Macao as well as nearby Singapore. December and January have shown strong trends for Macao and could be a good harbinger for the future.\n\nAt the same time, Las Vegas Sands is making some large renovations at both the Londoner Macao and its Marina Bay Sands resorts in Singapore. These investments should draw in more VIP guests and make both places top casino and resort draws in the region. While Las Vegas Sands tends to focus on the mass market, it is clearly trying to get more action in this very important part of the Chinese gaming market. In general, though, guests flock to more newly renovated properties with top amenities.\n\nThe New York bid is a bit of a wild card. If it can win a license to build a gaming resort in the state, it should be a boost to the stock. This adds some nice optionality.\n\nWhile the name comes with risks, it could be worth the gamble as I expect it to grow faster than its rivals, while trading at an attractive valuation compared to historical levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "There's A Lot To Like About Wynn Resorts' (NASDAQ:WYNN) Upcoming US$0.25 Dividend",
        "content": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Wynn Resorts' shares on or after the 16th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of February.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.25 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.00 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Wynn Resorts has a trailing yield of 0.9% on the current share price of US$105.60. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Wynn Resorts is paying out just 12% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Wynn Resorts, with earnings per share up 3.9% on average over the last five years. Growth has been anaemic. Yet with more than 75% of its earnings being kept in the business, there is ample room to reinvest in growth or lift the payout ratio - either of which could increase the dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Wynn Resorts has seen its dividend decline 22% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's unusual to see earnings per share increasing at the same time as dividends per share have been in decline. We'd hope it's because the company is reinvesting heavily in its business, but it could also suggest business is lumpy.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Wynn Resorts? Wynn Resorts has seen its earnings per share grow slowly in recent years, and the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which generally bodes well for its future prospects. Wynn Resorts ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in Wynn Resorts for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To that end, you should learn about the 5 warning signs we've spotted with Wynn Resorts (including 3 which are a bit unpleasant).\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
