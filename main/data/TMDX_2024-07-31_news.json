        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.21 per share. This compares to loss of $0.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical technology company would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of 800%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nTransMedics , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $114.31 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.89%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $52.47 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nTransMedics shares have added about 75.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14%.\n\nWhat's Next for TransMedics?\n\nWhile TransMedics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TransMedics: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.12 on $100.51 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.81 on $399.04 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Instruments is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the same industry, Silk Road Medical (SILK), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024.\n\nThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nSilk Road Medical's revenues are expected to be $49.6 million, up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(\"TransMedics\") (Nasdaq: TMDX), a medical technology company that is transforming organ transplant therapy for patients with end-stage lung, heart, and liver failure, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. (PRNewsfoto/TransMedics, Inc.)\n\nRecent Highlights\n\nTotal revenue of $114.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, a 118% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023 Generated net income of $12.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 Owned 15 total aircraft as of June 30, 2024 Purchased two additional aircraft in July 2024 Published 2023 Environmental, Social, and Governance (\"ESG\") update report on TransMedics corporate website\n\n\"We set a new high-water mark for the business in the second quarter of 2024, with product and service revenue growth driven by the sustained momentum of OCS NOP and our transplant logistics network,\" said Waleed Hassanein, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We remain well positioned to successfully execute our 2024 strategy and to launch our new OCS lung and heart clinical programs in 2025.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\r\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $114.3\u00a0million, a 118% increase compared to $52.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the increase in utilization of the Organ Care System (\"OCS\u2122\") across all three organs through the National OCS Program (\"NOP\u2122\") as well as additional revenue generated by the launch of TransMedics logistics services.\n\nGross margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 61%, compared to 70%\u00a0in the second quarter of 2023. The change from prior year is a result of a higher proportion of service revenue in 2024.\n\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $56.8 million, compared to $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in operating expense was driven primarily by increased research and development investment as well as investment throughout the organization to support the growth of the company. Second quarter operating expenses in 2024 included $7.3 million of stock compensation expense compared to $4.9\u00a0million of stock compensation expense in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income for the second quarter of 2024 was $12.2\u00a0million, or 10.7% of revenue, compared to a net loss of $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCash was $362.8 million as of June 30, 2024 compared to $350.2 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\n2024 Financial Outlook TransMedics is raising\u00a0its full year 2024 revenue guidance to be in the range of $425 million to $445 million, which represents 76% to 84% growth compared to the company's prior year revenue.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street project that TransMedics (TMDX) will announce quarterly earnings of $0.21 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 800% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $98.63 million, increasing 88% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings release, it is of utmost importance to factor in any revisions made to the earnings projections. These revisions serve as a critical gauge for predicting potential investor behaviors with respect to the stock. Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain TransMedics metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net revenue by OCS product- OCS Lung net revenue' should come in at $4.98 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +54.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net revenue by OCS product- OCS Liver net revenue' should arrive at $66.87 million. The estimate suggests a change of +104.6% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net revenue by OCS product- OCS Heart net revenue' to reach $23.99 million. The estimate suggests a change of +44.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenues- United States' will reach $88.26 million. The estimate indicates a change of +80.3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Geographic Revenues- All other countries' reaching $4.44 million. The estimate indicates a change of +26.2% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for TransMedics here>>>\r\n\r\nShares of TransMedics have demonstrated returns of -6.7% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change.

        "title": "TransMedics (TMDX) Moves to Buy: Rationale Behind the Upgrade",
        "content": "Investors might want to bet on TransMedics (TMDX), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for TransMedics basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor TransMedics, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for TransMedics\n\nThis medical technology company is expected to earn $0.81 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 205.2%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for TransMedics. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 701.9%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of TransMedics to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Medical device stocks are effectively redefining the healthcare industry through innovative technology.\n\nThe digitization trend in healthcare continues gaining steam, with advanced medical devices enhancing healthcare outcomes while becoming critical drivers in driving financial markets. These tools offer accurate diagnoses, effective treatments, and personalized care, improving healthcare outcomes substantially.\n\nHence, given their potential to revolutionize patient care, these devices will continue dominating the market and deliver massive long-term returns. Moreover, multiple research bodies are bullish on the medical device industry, forecasting sustained growth. KPMG is forecasting annual sales growth exceeding 5% to roughly $800 billion by 2030, and BCC Research is projecting a jump from $676 billion in 2022 to $953.4 billion in 2027.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that said, three leading medical device stocks currently leading the charge offer powerful long-term upside ahead. These firms are trailblazers in the medical device niche, boasting robust fundamentals.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) creates and develops robotic surgical systems, featuring its flagship product, the da Vinci surgical systems. Through the monstrous success of da Vinci, ISRG has evolved into a juggernaut in the medical device space, with its stock delivering an eye-watering 888% 10-year return.\n\nFrom a modest 286 systems in 2004, installations have soared to 8,887 by the first-quarter (Q1) of 2024, a staggering 3000% surge. This exponential growth in da Vinci system installations not only underscores the firm\u2019s strategic push to grow its market footprint but also instills confidence in the company\u2019s future trajectory.\n\nFurthermore, these systems involve a hefty initial investment along with ongoing costs for maintenance and disposable instruments, contributing to a recurring revenue model. Hence, ISRG\u2019s revenue base has grown by double-digit margins over the past several years.\n\nAdditionally, the da Vinci 5 release marks a significant leap forward, debuting with eight installations in Q1 alone. The da Vinci 5, which boasts enhanced capabilities, sets the stage for ground-breaking advancements in robotic-assisted surgery.\n\nDexcom (DXCM) A photo of a phone giving various medical information from an arm insertion.\n\nDexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM)\u00a0produces continuous glucose monitoring systems at the forefront of a fast-growing market. Consequently, over the past few years, the firm has grown rapidly, with its five-year top-line growth averaging 29.6%. Similarly, its net income margin has grown roughly 11% over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, recent results align with its lofty historical metrics, underscoring the enduring appeal of its market offerings. Additionally, DXCM has blown past analyst estimates across both lines in the past seven consecutive quarters.\n\nAs we look ahead, the company will continue benefitting from the growing global diabetes epidemic fueled by rising obesity rates and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Projections from Fortune Business Insights show a superb growth trajectory for the diabetes drugs industry, expected to jump 7% from $79.25 billion last year to $153.98 billion by 2032. This trend underscores a major opportunity for DexCom, highlighting its potential for sustained long-term growth.\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) hands holding a red heart shape against blue background symbolizing health\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Anastasia Zagoruyko\n\nTransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) is another top medical device stock known for its innovative Organ Care System (OCS) technology. Its cutting-edge technology effectively enhances transplant viability through perfusion, optimization, and real-time monitoring of donor organs. Moreover, with such a ground-breaking technology in place, TMDX stock has been a smash hit, surging upwards of 485% over the past five years, outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s gains of 86%.\n\nFurthermore, its head-spinning stock performance has been backed by spectacular operating results. TMDX has grown sales by 88% over the past five years, with year-over-year (YOY) growth at 149%. Its Q1 results showed a GAAP EPS of 35 cents, outpacing estimates by 36 cents. Moreover, sales came in at $96.85 million, marking a 132.8% YOY increase while beating forecasts by $13.08 million.\n\nWith these stellar results, TransMedics has bumped its 2024 revenue projections to fall between $390 million and $400 million, representing 61% to 66% growth over the prior-year period. Consequently, investment bank Stephens recently kicked off coverage of TMDX stock with an overweight rating. The bank applauded applauding its pioneering OCS technology and its robust financial footing, positioning it for long-term growth.

        "content": "Believe it or not, we're nearly halfway through this decade. The healthcare sector could be in store for monumental changes over the next few years.\n\nThese changes should present great opportunities for investors to make money. But where should they put their money? I predict these could be the best-performing healthcare stocks through 2030 (listed by descending market cap).\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) already ranks among the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. It has built a market cap of over $120 billion on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) franchise. But I think Vertex's growth prospects through the rest of the decade will come from non-CF therapies.\n\nThe big drugmaker already has one product outside of CF on the market. Vertex is ramping up the commercial launch of Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is a one-time functional cure for these two rare blood diseases.\n\nI predict that Vertex will add three other blockbuster drugs that don't treat CF to its lineup by 2030. It seems likely to win U.S. approval of suzetrigine (VX-548) in moderate-to-severe acute pain next year. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in a phase 3 clinical study targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Vertex's acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences will give it a late-stage candidate targeting another kidney disease, IgA nephropathy.\n\nDon't be surprised if Vertex achieves major milestones in curing type 1 diabetes over the next few years. The company has two experimental islet cell therapies in phase 1/2 testing that hold tremendous potential in curing the disease that affects roughly 3.8 million individuals in North America and Europe.\n\n2. Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) doesn't have an approved product on the market yet. However, its market cap of around $5.2 billion underscores investors' excitement about Viking's pipeline.\n\nThe huge stock gain for Viking in 2024 is primarily due to positive news for its experimental obesity drug, VK2735. Earlier this year, Viking announced impressive results from a phase 2 study of VK2735. The drug achieved greater weight loss after 13 weeks than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound.\n\nObesity isn't the only big market Viking is going after. A few weeks ago, the company reported positive results from a phase 2 study evaluating VK2809 in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is also known as metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Some analysts project that NASH/MASH could top $100 billion by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's not all. Viking also has two early stage programs. It reported promising results in March for an oral version of VK2735. The company is evaluating VK0214 in a phase 1b study targeting X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a rare genetic disorder.\n\n3. TransMedics Group\n\nI don't think the list of big healthcare winners through 2030 will be limited to only biotech stocks. TransMedics Group(NASDAQ: TMDX) could be one of the top-performing medical device stocks through the rest of this decade and beyond. Its market cap of roughly $4.8 billion doesn't reflect the company's potential, in my view.\n\nTransMedics is revolutionizing the organ transplant market. With the current standard of care (using coolers for transportation), most donated hearts, lungs, and livers don't make it to their intended recipient. TransMedics' OCS (Organ Care System) technology keeps organs functioning during transportation. The result: Significantly higher utilization and reduction of severe post-transplant complications.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for TransMedics has been the lack of availability of airplanes to transport organs. That won't be much of a problem going forward, though. The company acquired a charter plane operator and has built its own fleet of aircraft.\n\nI predict TransMedics' OCS will become the standard of care in organ transplants. I also believe the company will expand the size of the U.S. transplant market and move into other countries over time.

        "content": "We feel now is a pretty good time to analyse TransMedics Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TMDX) business as it appears the company may be on the cusp of a considerable accomplishment. TransMedics Group, Inc., a commercial-stage medical technology company, engages in transforming organ transplant therapy for end-stage organ failure patients in the United States and internationally. The US$4.6b market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$25m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$10m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven. The most pressing concern for investors is TransMedics Group's path to profitability \u2013 when will it breakeven? In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable.\n\nView our latest analysis for TransMedics Group\n\nConsensus from 9 of the American Medical Equipment analysts is that TransMedics Group is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2023, before generating positive profits of US$34m in 2024. Therefore, the company is expected to breakeven roughly 12 months from now or less. At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 42%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict. earnings-per-share-growth\n\nUnderlying developments driving TransMedics Group's growth isn\u2019t the focus of this broad overview, though, bear in mind that by and large a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.\n\nBefore we wrap up, there\u2019s one issue worth mentioning. TransMedics Group currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn\u2019t exceed 40% of your equity, which in this case, the company has significantly overshot. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nThis article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on TransMedics Group, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at TransMedics Group's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of essential factors you should further research:\n\nValuation: What is TransMedics Group worth today?

        "content": "Medical devices are spearheading the digitalization of healthcare, reports analytics and software development company Luxoft. Specifically, medical devices are \u201cproviding accurate diagnoses, effective treatments and personalized care through advanced algorithms and patient data analysis.\u201d\n\nMoreover, artificial intelligence (AI) is altering and improving the means by which many medical devices are created and work. Indeed, by quickly creating many prototypes based on design parameters and patient data, AI is allowing devices to be launched significantly faster and making them more effective. The latter development is likely lowering companies\u2019 costs, while the former quality will probably enable them to charge more for their devices, raising revenue.\n\nAI can also allow each device to be tailored to individual patients\u2019 needs. It is another development that will probably allow medical device makers to charge more for their offerings. For investors wanting to exploit these trends, here are the three best medical device stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical\u2019s (NASDAQ:ISRG) robots assist doctors with surgeries. At the end of last year, over 8,600 of the company\u2019s da Vinci surgery-assistance robots were being utilized. That is a robust 14% increase versus the end of 2022.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest product, da Vinci 5, was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It features many improvements over the previous iteration, according to Intuitive Surgical. For example, surgeons can use up to 43% more force with the new device because of its increased sensitivity. The system also provides clearer, more realistic images. Additionally, AI-powered software enhancements can improved it.\n\nMultiple major Wall Street banks are upbeat on ISRG stock. For example, Bank of America included the name on its list of best investment ideas in April while Citi incorporated ISRG stock into its list of top large-cap stocks in April.\n\nAnalysts expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to climb to $7.37 next year, up from $6.29 in 2024.\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) hands holding a red heart shape against blue background symbolizing health\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Anastasia Zagoruyko\n\nTransMedics\u2019 (NASDAQ:TMDX) organ care system (OCS) technology provides \u201cperfusion, optimization, and monitoring\u201d for organs for transplanting into human patients. According to the firm, its OCS also offers \u201cnear-physiologic conditions for donor organs outside of the human body\u201d\n\nOn June 4, investment bank Stephens started coverage of TMDX stock with an \u201coverweight\u201d rating. The investment bank said the company\u2019s OCS is improving the results of transplants while increasing the percentage of donated organs that can be successfully utilized. Finally, Stephens added that TransMedic\u2019s products reduce hospital costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, the company\u2019s top line soared by a very impressive 133% versus the same period a year earlier to $96.85 million. And its net income came in at $12.2 million versus a net loss of $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. Finally, TransMedics increased its full-year sales guidance to $390 million to $400 million from its previous outlook of $360 million to $370 million.\n\nUnited Therapeutics (UTHR) In this photo illustration United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR) logo is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) is unique because it has developed both medical devices and drugs with multiple treatments and devices for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nIn December, Morgan Stanley named UTHR stock as one of 32 names \u201cwith high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating,\u201d according to Seeking Alpha.\n\nIn Q1, the company\u2019s revenue jumped 34% versus the same period a year earlier to $677.7 million. Net income advanced 27.7% YOY to $306.6 million.\n\nUTHR stock has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 13 times, while it receives the highest possible Composite Rating of 99 from Investor\u2019s Business Daily. Moreover, the publication gives the stock an Accumulation/Distribution grade of A. That indicates many large institutions have been buying the shares in the last 13 weeks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, TMDX crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular trading tool. It provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period, and is beneficial to short-term traders since it smooths out price fluctuations and provides more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nThe 20-day moving average can show signals that are similar to other SMAs as well. If a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.\n\nTMDX has rallied 5.5% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. This combination suggests TMDX could be on the verge of another move higher.\n\nThe bullish case solidifies once investors consider TMDX's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 6 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.\n\nWith a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on TMDX for more gains in the near future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 3.9% return this week takes TransMedics Group's (NASDAQ:TMDX) shareholders three-year gains to 460%",
        "content": "For us, stock picking is in large part the hunt for the truly magnificent stocks. Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more. For example, the TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) share price is up a whopping 460% in the last three years, a handsome return for long term holders. On top of that, the share price is up 74% in about a quarter.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for TransMedics Group\n\nGiven that TransMedics Group didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. That's because it's hard to be confident a company will be sustainable if revenue growth is negligible, and it never makes a profit.\n\nTransMedics Group's revenue trended up 82% each year over three years. That's much better than most loss-making companies. And it's not just the revenue that is taking off. The share price is up 78% per year in that time. It's always tempting to take profits after a share price gain like that, but high-growth companies like TransMedics Group can sometimes sustain strong growth for many years. So we'd recommend you take a closer look at this one, or even put it on your watchlist.\n\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think TransMedics Group will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that TransMedics Group has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 96% in the last twelve months. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 40%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TransMedics Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  TransMedics Group is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this freelist of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why TransMedics (TMDX) is a Great Choice",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at TransMedics (TMDX), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. TransMedics currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for TMDX that show why this medical technology company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor TMDX, shares are up 1.55% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is down 0.56% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 41.94% compares favorably with the industry's 1.69% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of TransMedics have risen 49.46%, and are up 76.92% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.3% and 28.9%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to TMDX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. TMDX is currently averaging 1,112,849 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with TMDX.\n\nOver the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost TMDX's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.22 to $0.76 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that TMDX is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep TransMedics on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Trending Stock TransMedics Group, Inc. (TMDX) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this medical technology company have returned +50.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.6% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which TransMedics belongs, has lost 2.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, TransMedics is expected to post earnings of $0.21 per share, indicating a change of +800% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +371.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.62 points to a change of +180.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +559.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.97 indicates a change of +56.2% from what TransMedics is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +136.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TransMedics is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for TMDX _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor TransMedics, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $98.78 million indicates a year-over-year change of +88.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $398.76 million and $518.61 million estimates indicate +65% and +30.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTransMedics reported revenues of $96.85 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +133.1%. EPS of $0.35 for the same period compares with -$0.08 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $83.32 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +16.24%. The EPS surprise was +800%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTransMedics is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TransMedics. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And with that, I will now turn the call over to Waleed Hassanein, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nStory continues\n\nWaleed Hassanein: Thank you, Laine. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to TransMedics\u2019 first quarter 2024 earnings call. As always, joining me today is Stephen Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. For the past two years, TransMedics has delivered exceptional revenue growth while making transformational investments in our business. 2024 represents another crucial year, not only for exceptional growth but also for broadening our infrastructure and product pipeline to drive further growth, profitability and importantly, increased transplant volumes. Specifically, we are focused on three verticals; first, completing the initial buildout phase of our TransMedics aviation fleet and transplant logistics infrastructure. Second, preparing for the launch of three major new clinical programs to accelerate OCS lung and OCS heart adoption and expand our clinical indications for OCS heart in the US.\n\nAnd finally, growing the overall, national transplant volumes even further through our one of a kind NOP program. On every front, we have started the year with very strong momentum towards achieving these goals. With 1Q results representing a new high watermark for our business, let me review the key highlights for first quarter performance. Total Revenue for Q1 grew to $96.9 million, representing 133% growth over Q1 2023 and a 19% sequential growth from Q4 2023. This growth was achieved through increased utilization of both, OCS product across lung, heart and liver, as well as TransMedics transplant logistic service. I want to highlight the diversified nature of our growth to dispel any potential misperception that our growth is only driven overwhelmingly by transplant logistics revenue growth.\n\nSaid differently, we fully expect -- I repeat, we fully expect our future growth to be driven by both, increased product and transplant logistics adoption. TransMedics transplant logistics service revenue for Q1 was $14.5 million, up from $9.2 million in Q4 of last year, representing approximately 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. We are continuing to demonstrate that our integrated and cost efficient TransMedics NOP and logistics service infrastructures are delivering real value to transplant programs across the US. We remain focused on expanding our operational capabilities for TransMedics logistics throughout 2024 which I will detail further later in the presentation today. Our overall gross margins for Q1 was 62%, up from 59% last quarter and in line with our expectations.\n\nWe are extremely confident that we will be able to further improve the gross margin over the next 12 to 18 months as we achieve more leverage of scale in both, product and service operations. The strong growth in revenue and gross margins enabled us to deliver GAAP operating profit of $12.4 million which presents 13% of total revenue. Net income was $12.2 million. We are very proud to have achieved these profitability metrics while still investing heavily in future growth. We remain laser focused, however, on delivering sustainable positive operating cash flow over the next several quarters. Before moving on to our momentum beyond our financial performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the entire TransMedics team which had -- which has worked tirelessly to achieve these results.\n\nWe are focused on execution to build upon the Q1 result. Now with that background, let me provide more detail across key operating metrics. As I stated above, we set a new high watermark for case volume across all three organ markets in Q1. Overall, NOP contribution remains at 98%-plus of our case volume; a trend which we expect will continue throughout the foreseeable future. Turning now to the key TransMedics transplant logistics metrics. Through Q1 we continue to expand our fleet of owned aircrafts reaching 14 on aircrafts by end of the quarter. Meanwhile, the daily average number of active TransMedics aviation planes were 9 planes in Q1 compared to 7 in Q4 of 2023. We expect this number will continue to increase throughout the year as we strive to reach 15 to 20 operational aircrafts by year-end.\n\nOur owned aircrafts covered approximately 49% of our NOP flight missions in Q1 compared to 35% in Q4 of 2023. This further underscores the potential long runway to drive additional growth and maximizing efficiency across our transplant logistics operations. As we stated before, at scale we fully expect to cover 80%-plus of the total NOP missions using our TransMedics logistics services for both, air and ground transport. We will continue to use carefully selected highly reliable and safe operators for supplemental lifts to support our additional missions. From a customer footprint perspective, we have also continued to grow the number of programs that are using our transplant logistic services. In Q1, approximately 105 US transplant programs used TransMedics logistics compared to approximately 97 in Q4 of 2023.\n\nAs we have rapidly achieved this critical mass of our users, we are now focusing on going deeper within these programs and meeting more of their transplant logistics needs going forward. Overall, we're very pleased with the early success of our transplant logistics services and are confident that transplant programs are seeing the significant cost efficiency and reliability of TransMedics logistics compared to historical model. We look forward to expanding further throughout the year and into 2025 as we scale our air fleet and ground operations. We are also encouraged by our growing base of clinical evidence from real world outcomes and the growing excitement around our offering across clinical transplant users. We saw this excitement firsthand in April of this year as we attended the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant Conference in Prague.\n\nAt the meeting, several scientific presentations by transplant academic experts demonstrating the value of OCS heart and OCS lung were presented. Here are the key highlights. Dr. Jacob Schroder from Duke presented the OCS Heart Perfusion or OHP registry experience with DCD heart transplants in the US. The data demonstrated that OCS heart was used in approximately three quarters of all DCD heart transplanted at OHP registry centers. The data also demonstrated that OCS DCD heart transplants had superior patient survival outcomes compared to NRP DCD transplants in high-risk recipients. This provided evidence that OCS heart affords better protection of the DCD donor hearts as compared to NRP. During his presentation, Dr. Schroder commented that the overall OCS NOP cost is more favorable to NRP costs when factoring in the cost of dry runs, the clinical support overhead and the hardware costs.\n\nImportantly, Dr. Schroder highlighted that the OCS NOP enhances the ability for any heart transplant program in the US to offer the clinical service of DCD heart transplantation to their patients without the burden of overhead costs and clinical learning curves, giving the standard or unified procurement and management of donor hearts by the TransMedics NOP staff. Next, Dr. Mani Daneshmand from Emory University Medical Center presented the outcomes of OCS BCD compared to standard-of-care DBD hearts in the US. The data showed that OCS DCD hearts were transported nearly double the distance from donor to recipients and had doubled the cross-clamp time [ph]. This signifies the broader access to DCD donors afforded by OCS NOP. The data also showed that despite higher risk donor factors, OCS clinical outcomes were similar to standard criteria DBD outcomes in the US.\n\nThis further validates the safety profile of the OCS Heart. Simply stated that, the OCS enabled a DCD heart transplant to have similar survival outcomes to the US National DBD heart transplant outcomes which are the best in the world. Dr. Daneshmand also highlighted that the increased use of OCS NOP has led to significant reduction in moderate and severe primary graft dysfunction or PGD, after OCS DCD heart transplants. If your PGD is the most severe early post-heart transplant clinical complication and historically has been associated with worse, short and long-term patients survive. Next, Dr. Mauricio Villavicencio from Mayo Clinic presented the OCS Heart DBD experience from the OHP registry. The data showed that OCS NOP resulted in excellent post-transplant clinical outcomes from DBD donors compared to standard criteria donors preserved with static cold storage, despite having 3x longer distance travel and doubled cross-clamp time in the OCS NOP arm [ph].\n\nAgain, this data validates the broader access to distant donors and potential for improved workflow afforded by the OCS NOP. Next, Dr. Gabe Blore [ph] from Baylor St. Luke's presented the OCS lung expand trial 5-year clinical results. The data showed that the OCS lung expand lungs from extended criteria DBD and DCD donors had similar survival and freedom from chronic rejection at 5-years post-transplant compared to routine standard criteria DBD lung transplanted at the same program over the same time period. These results support the huge clinical potential of increasing donor lung utilization for transplants using extended criteria DBD and DCD donors in the US. Finally, Dr. Steve Huddleston, from the University of Minnesota shared the latest data from the thoracic OCS perfusion registry or the TOP registry. A surgeon in a modern operating theatre performing a transplant surgery with medical technology.\n\nThe data showed that the OCS lung enabled the use of extended criteria donor lungs for DBD and DCD donors and resulted in post-transplant survival outcomes that are similar to standard criteria lung transplant, despite nearly having doubled the cross-clamp time, again, further validating the huge clinical impact on expanding the donor pool and the potential growth of lung transplant volumes in the US. Collectively, these presentations once again highlighted our ever-growing body of positive clinical evidence, as well as the exceptional clinical outcomes enabled by OCS and NOP. Now, let me shift gears and talk about our plans to further grow OCS adoption and the overall national US transplant volumes even further. Specifically, I want to discuss three new major clinical programs designed to grow adoption of our OCS lung and OCS heart, as well as expand our OCS heart FDA clinical indications in the US.\n\nPending FDA approval, we expect that all three programs will initiate enrollment within the next year. Let me start with detailing the OCS lung program. As we stated many times, we believe that the clinical stakeholders across the United States lung transplant market need to be reintroduced to the potential positive clinical value of the OCS lung perfusion and assessment. More specifically, we believe the ability of the OCS lung and NOP to increase their transplant volumes, improve their post-transplant clinical outcomes and enhanced workflow remain underappreciated. Our goal is to replicate the successful outcomes achieved with OCS liver where 62% of transplant volumes at OCS NOP programs are now done in the morning working hours compared to middle of the night and replicating that with the OCS lung.\n\nSaid differently, we want to have lung transplant programs and clinical and surgeons experience firsthand the value of OCS NOP to enable morning transplants while growing their overall transplant volumes and improving their post-transplant clinical outcomes. To do this, we're planning to launch a new clinical program to achieve the following. First, we will target a minimum of 12 to 24-hour plus of OCS lung perfusion using the NOP model to increase access to transplantable donor lungs and optimize work hours for transplant program staff. Importantly, we aim to prospectively randomize between OCS NOP versus controlled cold static storage to assess a clinical value. We also plan to use newly developed near physiologic OCS perfusion solution combined with blood to minimize the impact of longer perfusion on lung edema and potentially eliminate any clinical concerns of lung perfusion times on lung function.\n\nWe will also use next-gen perfusion circuitry [ph] and ventilation modality to maximize the protection for the donor lungs during prolonged OCS perfusion and ex-vivo ventilation [ph]. We expect the entire clinical program to be managed by NOP to increase the rate of enrollment and adoption during the trial phase. From a timing perspective, we are targeting initiation of this program sometimes around the end of 2024. Now, let me move on to our planned OCS heart programs. We are also actively working on two distinct large OCS heart programs in the US that will be also managed exclusively via the OCS NOP model. The first is OCS heart therapeutic warm perfusion for DBD hearts. This program is aimed at increasing utilization of DBD hearts from both, standard and extended criteria donors to increase the overall heart transplant volumes in the US.\n\nWe intend to target 12-hour plus of OCS heart perfusion using the NOP model to increase access to donor hearts and optimize the work working hours for our transplant program staff. We will also aim to prospectively randomized OCS NOP versus controlled called cold static storage to assess the clinical value. We're planning not only to use our newly developed near physiologic OCS perfusion solution combined with blood but in this particular program we're adding a new proprietary metabolic enhancing therapeutic agents to maximize protection of the donor heart and improve its post-transplant clinical performance. From a timing perspective, we are talking are getting initiation some of this program sometimes around the end of 2024. Finally, our second heart program is a new program that will require a new technology from the ground-up.\n\nIt's aiming at OCS heart cold oxygenated perfusion for DBD hearts that are preserved for less than six hours. This program is designed to support a new FDA clinical indication for OCS heart in the US that will allow us to perfuse and preserve standard criteria DBD hearts for less than six hours which is not our current clinical indications in the US. To do this, we're planning to offer a new lower cost product that utilizes cold oxygenated blood-based perfusion technology. More specifically, we're developing our new pulsatile [ph] fully portable cold perfusion technology and cold perfusion circuitry to achieve easy-to-use system for use within our existing NOP model. Again, we'll aim to prospectively randomized to hold controlled cold static storage to assess the clinical value.\n\nAnd we are targeting early 2025 to initiate this important clinical program. As you can see, we are advancing a very strong pipeline of clinical programs designed to drive significant growth in OCS case volume and the overall national cardiothoracic transplant volume in the US. However, we're not stopping here. We're also continuing to invest heavily in our next-gen OCS technology platform for all four -- for all three organs that will be highly automated, optimized for NOP workflow and designed to streamline the clinical support workload to allow us to continue to deliver the highest clinical quality of care and achieve better product leverage. We plan to share more details in this initiatives later this year. To summarize, we are highly encouraged by our Q1 performance and are focused on several initiatives designed to further propel growth for TransMedics products and services.\n\nGiven our strong performance in Q1, we are increasing our annual revenue guidance to $390 million to $400 million which represents 61% to 66% growth over full year 2023 revenue. With that, let me turn the call to Steven to cover the detailed financial results for the quarter.\n\nStephen Gordon: Thank you, Waleed. I will now provide some additional detail on the Q1 results and other financial information for the quarter. So starting with revenue. For the first quarter of 2024, our total revenue was $96.9 million. This is an increase of 133% from the first quarter of 2023 and a 19% sequential increase from last quarter. The $96.9 million included $0.9 million related to our flight school. We have now exited all of the Summit Legacy Charter business. So other than this $900,000 from the flight school, all revenue is transplant-related. In the U.S., transplant revenue was $91.9 million. U.S. revenue increased 145% from the first quarter of 2023 and 22% sequentially from last quarter. And as Waleed said, Q1 2024 revenue included $14.5 million of logistics revenue.\n\nThe organ breakdown on U.S. revenue was $67 million of liver, $20.2 million of heart and $4.7 million of loan, all organs growing substantially over Q1 2023 and sequentially from Q4 2023. Ex U.S. revenue was $4.1 million, a 1% increase from Q1 of 2023 and a 16% sequential increase from last quarter. The ex U.S. breakdown was $3.1 million of heart and $1 million of lung. Next, on the product and service revenue. As a reminder, our service revenue includes the added amounts we charge for the NOP clinical service of surgical procurement and organ management and also includes the logistics revenue. The flight school is also included in service rep. In Q1, product revenue was $61.3 million and service revenue was $35.5 million. So the service portion was 36.7% of the total.\n\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 62%. This is down from 69% in the first quarter of 2023 and up from 59% last quarter. In comparison to Q1 last year, this reflects the higher service component of our business which did not include logistics in the first quarter last year. Product margin was 77% in Q1, recovering as expected to more normalized product margins from the 73% we saw in Q4 which included a onetime unfavorable item. Service margin was 36%, improved from 35% last quarter as we continue to gain efficiency in our service offering. And as a reminder, all costs related to aviation, including fuel, pilots, maintenance and depreciation, are included on our service COGS. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $47.5 million, 54% above Q1 2023 OpEx. This expense growth was driven by 94% growth in R&D related to investments in new product development, NOP tools and product quality and regulatory resources.\n\nSG&A grew 45%, primarily related to higher personnel costs and overall corporate infrastructure. I want to point out that our operating expenses grew significantly throughout the year last year. So the year-on-year growth comparison next quarter should not be as pronounced as it was this quarter. Given the strong revenue and margin performance, we were able to deliver GAAP operating profit of $12.4 million or 13% of revenue. Net income was $12.2 million. These compared with an operating loss of $2.6 million and also a net loss of $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023. And basic earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37 and diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.35. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $350.2 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\nThis is down $44.6 million from December 31, 2023. $39 million of cash was used to purchase 3 additional jets in Q1, bringing our total number of owned jets to 14. Basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were 32.8 million and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were 34.7 million. In summary, Q1 was a very successful quarter financially for TransMedics. We grew our revenue both annually and sequentially, improved our gross margin and showed good drop-down to profitability. All of this continues to validate our strategy of leveraging our NOP clinical service and logistics service to increase utilization of the Organ Care System and to increase the number of transplants in the U.S. Finally, just to repeat Waleed's earlier comment, we are updating our annual revenue guidance to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million which represents 61% to 66% growth over the full year 2023.\n\nNow, I'll turn the call back to Waleed for closing comments.\n\nWaleed Hassanein: Thank you, Stephen. Overall, we are humbled and proud of our Q1 results as we simultaneously drove continued revenue growth, expanded our infrastructure and achieve profitability while advancing our clinical and R&D pipelines. We're looking forward to continuing to execute on all the major initiatives throughout 2024 to drive broader adoption of OCS NOP and growth of the overall transplant volumes to help patients in need of an organ transplant. With that, I will now turn the call to the operator for Q&A.

        "title": "Will TransMedics (TMDX) Gain on Rising Earnings Estimates?",
        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.\n\nThe upward trend in estimate revisions for this medical technology company reflects growing optimism of analysts on its earnings prospects, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.\n\nFor TransMedics, there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising earnings estimates, which has helped push consensus estimates considerably higher for the next quarter and full year.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nCurrent-Quarter Estimate Revisions\n\nThe company is expected to earn $0.17 per share for the current quarter, which represents a year-over-year change of +666.67%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TransMedics has increased 315.39% over the last 30 days, as four estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revisions.\n\nCurrent-Year Estimate Revisions\n\nThe company is expected to earn $0.54 per share for the full year, which represents a change of +170.13% from the prior-year number.\n\nThe revisions trend for the current year also appears quite promising for TransMedics, with four estimates moving higher over the past month compared to no negative revisions. The consensus estimate has also received a boost over this time frame, increasing 500%.\n\nFavorable Zacks Rank\n\nThanks to promising estimate revisions, TransMedics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&P 500.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile strong estimate revisions for TransMedics have attracted decent investments and pushed the stock 61.2% higher over the past four weeks, further upside may still be left in the stock. So, you may consider adding it to your portfolio right away.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "TransMedics Group, Inc. (TMDX) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",
        "content": "Shares of TransMedics (TMDX) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 61.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $124.52 in the previous session. TransMedics has gained 57.7% since the start of the year compared to the 2% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the 3.7% return for the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 30, 2024, TransMedics reported EPS of $0.35 versus consensus estimate of $-0.05.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, TransMedics is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share on $398.8 million in revenues. This represents a 170.13% change in EPS on a 65.05% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.88 per share on $508.46 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 62.65% and 27.5%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nTransMedics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nTransMedics has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 230.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 26.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 874.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.7X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, TransMedics currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if TransMedics meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though TransMedics shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Should You Think About Buying TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) Now?",
        "content": "TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX), is not the largest company out there, but it led the NASDAQGM gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at TransMedics Group\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for TransMedics Group\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In TransMedics Group?\n\nGood news, investors! TransMedics Group is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $205.47, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, TransMedics Group\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nCan we expect growth from TransMedics Group? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. In TransMedics Group's case, its revenues over the next couple of years are expected to double, indicating an incredibly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since TMDX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on TMDX for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy TMDX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into TransMedics Group, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "title": "Is TransMedics (TMDX) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TransMedics (TMDX).\n\nTransMedics currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 85.7% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for TMDX Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for TMDX\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for TransMedics here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying TransMedics, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs TMDX Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for TransMedics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$0.14.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TransMedics. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for TransMedics.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And welcome to TransMedics First Quarter 2024 earnings call. As always, joining me today is Stephen Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. For the past two years, TransMedics has delivered exceptional revenue growth while making transformational investments in our business. 2024 represents another crucial year, not only for exceptional growth, but also for broadening our infrastructure and product pipeline to drive further growth profitability and importantly, increased transplant volumes. Specifically, we are focused on three verticals. First, completing the initial build-out phase of our TransMedics aviation fleet and transplant logistics infrastructure. Second, preparing for the launch of three major new clinical programs to accelerate OCS Lung and OCS Heart adoption and expand our clinical indications for OCS Heart in the US.\r\n And finally, growing the overall national transplant volumes even further through our one-of-a-kind NOP. program. On every front, we have started the year with very strong momentum towards achieving these goals with 1Q results representing a new high watermark for our business. Let me review the key highlights for first quarter performance. Total revenue for Q1 grew to $96.9 million, representing 133% growth over Q1 2023 and a 19% sequential growth from Q4 2023. This growth was achieved through increased utilization of both Four-Cs product across lung, heart and liver as well as TransMedics transplant logistics service. I want to highlight that the diversified nature of our growth to dispel any potential miss perception that our growth is only driven overwhelmingly by transplant logistics revenue growth.\r\n Said differently, we fully expect I repeat, we fully expect our future growth to be driven by both increased product and transplant logistics adapt TransMedics transplant logistics service revenue for Q1 was $14.5 million, up from $9.2 million in Q4 of last year, representing approximately 58% growth quarter over quarter. We are continuing to demonstrate that our integrated and cost effective efficient, TransMedics MOP and logistics service infrastructures. It's delivering real value to transplant programs across the US. We remain focused on expanding our operational capabilities for TransMedics logistics throughout 2024, which will which I will detail further on later in the presentation today.\r\n Our overall gross margins for Q1 was 62%, up from 59% last quarter. And in line with our expectations, we are extremely confident that we will be able to further improve the gross gross margin over the next 12 to 18 months as we achieve more leverage of scale in both products and service operations. Strong growth in revenue and gross margins enabled us to deliver GAAP operating profit of $12.4 million, which represents 13% of total revenue. Net income was $12.2 million. We are very proud to have achieved these profitability metrics while still investing heavily in future growth. We remain laser focused, however, on delivering sustainable positive operating cash flow over the next several quarters.\r\n Before moving on to our momentum beyond our financial performance. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the entire TransMedics team, which had which has worked tirelessly to achieve these results. We are full. We are focused on execution to build upon Q1 results. Now with that background, let me provide more detail across key operating metrics. As I stated above, we set a new high watermark for case volume across all three, Oregon markets in Q1. Overall, NOP contribution remains at 98 plus percent of our case volume, a trend which we expect will continue throughout the foreseeable future.\r\n Turning now to the key TransMedics transplant logistics metrics. Through Q1, we continued to expand our fleet of owned aircraft, reaching 14 owned aircraft by end of the quarter. Meanwhile, the daily average number of active mix. Aviation planes were nine planes in Q1 compared to seven in Q4 of 2023. We expect this number will continue to increase throughout the year as we strive to reach 15 to 20 operational aircraft. By year end, our owned aircraft covered approximately 49% of our NOP. flight missions in Q1 compared to 35% in Q4 of 23. This further underscores the potential long runway to drive additional growth and maximizing efficiency across our transplant logistics operations. As we stated before, at scale, we fully expect to cover 80 plus percent of debt total NOP emissions using our TransMedics logistics services for both air and ground transport. We will continue to use carefully selected highly reliable and safe operators for supplemental lifts to support our additional missions.\r\n From a customer footprint perspective, we have also continued to grow the number of programs that are using our transplant logistics services in Q1, approximately 105 U.S. transplant programs use TransMedics logistics compared to approximately 97 in Q4 of 2023, as we have rapidly achieved this critical mass of users. We are now focusing on going deeper within these programs and meeting more of their transplant logistics needs going forward.\r\n Overall, we're very pleased with the early success of our transplant logistics services and are confident that transplant programs are seeing the significant cost efficiency and reliability of TransMedics logistics compared to historical model. We look forward to expanding further throughout the year and into 2025 as we scale our air fleet and ground operations. We are also encouraged by our growing base of clinical evidence from real-world outcomes and the growing excitement around our offering across clinical transplant users. We saw this excitement firsthand in April of this year as we attended the International Society of Heart Lung Transplant conference in Prague at the meeting. Several scientific presentations by transplant academic experts demonstrating the value of OCS Heart and OCS Lung were presented.\r\n Here are the key highlights. Dr. Jacobs charter from Duke presented the OCS Heart perfusion or OHP. registry experience with DCD heart transplants in the U.S., the data demonstrated that OCS Heart was used in approximately three quarters of all DCD Heart transplanted at OHP. registry centers. The data also demonstrated that OCS DCD heart transplants had superior patient survival outcomes compared to NRPDCD. transplants in high-risk recipients. This provides evidence this provided evidence that OCS Heart affords better protection of the DCD donor hearts as compared to NRP during his presentation, Dr. Schroeder commented that the overall OCSNOP. cost is more favorable to NRP costs when factoring in the cost of dry runs that clinical support, overhead, Anda and hardware costs.\r\n Importantly, Dr. Shore, I highlighted that the OCSNOP. enhances the ability of for any heart transplant program in the U.S. to offer the clinical service of DCD heart transplantation to their patients without the burden of overhead costs and clinical learning curves, giving the standard or unified procurement and management of donor hearts by that TransMedics NOP staff.\r\n Next, Dr. Danny diminishment from money diminishment from Emory University Medical Center presented the outcomes of OCSDCD. compared to standard of care DBD hearts in the US. The data showed that OCSDCD. hearts were transported nearly doubled the distance from donor to recipients and had doubled across prime time. This signifies the broader access to DCD donors afforded by OCSNOP. The data also showed that despite higher risk donor factors, OCS clinical outcomes were similar to standard criteria, DBD outcomes in the US. This further validates the safety profile of the OCS Heart. Simply stated, the OCS enabled a DCD heart transplant to have similar survival outcomes to the U.S. national DBD heart transplant outcomes, which are the best in the world.\r\n Dr. management also highlighted that the increase of the increased use of OCSNOP. has led to significant reduction in moderate and severe primary graft dysfunction or PGD. after OCS DCD heart transplant. Severe PGD. is the most severe early post heart transplant clinical complication and historically has been associated with worse short and long-term patient survival.\r\n Next, Dr. Maurer HU. village sends you from Mayo Clinic presented the OCS Heart DBD experience from the OHB. registry data showed that OCSNOP. resulted in excellent post-transplant clinical outcomes from DBD donors compared to standard criteria. Donors preserved with static cold storage despite having three times longer distance travel and doubled across time time in the OCS. and OPR. Again, this data validates the broader access to distant donors and potential for improved workflow afforded by the OCSNOP. Dr. de Boer from Baylor St. Luke's presented the OCS Lung EXPAND trial five year clinical results. The data showed that the OCS Lung expand once from extended criteria. DBD. and DCD. donors had similar survival and freedom from chronic rejection at five years post transplant compared to routine standard criteria. Ebitda long transplanted at the same program over the same time period. These results support the huge clinical potential of increasing donor lung utilization for transplants using extended criteria, DBD. and DCD. donors in the US.\r\n Finally, Dr. Steve Hudson from University of Minnesota shared the latest data from the thoracic OCS perfusion registry or the top registry. The data showed that the OCS Lung enabled the use of extended criteria, donor lungs from DVD and DCD donors and resulted in post-transplant survival outcomes that are similar to standard criteria lung transplant, despite nearly having double the cross clamp time, again, further validating the huge clinical impact on expanding the donor pool and the potential growth of lung transplant volumes in the US. Collectively, these presentations, once again, highlighted our ever growing body of positive clinical evidence as well as the exceptional clinical outcomes enabled by OCS and NOP.\r\n Now let me shift gears and talk about our plans to further grow OCS adoption and the overall national U.S. transplant volumes even further. Specifically, I want to I want to discuss three new major clinical programs designed to grow adoption of our OCS, lung and OCS Heart, as well as expand our OCS part of the clinical indications in the U.S. pending FDA approval, we expect that all three programs will initiate enrollment within the next year.\r\n Let me start with detailing the OCS lung program. As we stated many times, we believe that the clinical stakeholders across the United States lung transplant market need to be reintroduced to the potential positive clinical value of the OCS lung perfusion and assessment. More specifically, we believe the ability of the OCS, lung and NOP to increase their transplant volumes improve their post-transplant clinical outcomes and enhance workflow remain under appreciated. Our goal is to replicate the successful outcomes achieved with OCS. Liver were 62% of transplant volumes at OCS. and OP. programs are now done in the morning working hours compared to middle of the night and replicating that with OCS Lung or said differently, we want to have lung transplant programs and clinical and surgeons' experience firsthand the value of OCSNOP. to enable morning transplants while growing their overall transplant volumes and improving their post-transplant clinical outcomes.\r\n To do this, we're planning to launch a new clinical program to achieve the following. First, we will target a minimum of 12 to 24 hour plus of OCS lung perfusion using the NOP. model to increase access to a transplantable donor lungs and Optimiz work hours for transplant program staff. Importantly, we aim to prospectively randomized between OCSNOP. versus controlled cold static storage to assess the clinical value. We also plan to use newly-developed near physiologic OCS perfusion solution combined with blood to minimize the impact of longer perfusion on lung edema and potentially eliminate any clinical concerns of long perfusion times on lung function.\r\n We will also use next gen perfusion circuitry and ventilation modalities to maximize that protection for the donor lungs during prolonged OCS perfusion and ex vivo installation, we expect the entire clinical program to be managed via NOP to increase the rate of enrollment and adoption during the trial phase. From a timing perspective, we are targeting initiation of this program sometime around the end of 2024.\r\n Now let me move on to our planned OCS heart programs. We are also actively working on two distinct large OCS heart programs in the U.S. that will be also managed exclusively via the OCSNOP. model. The first is OCS Heart therapeutic warm perfusion for DBD heart. This program is aimed at increasing utilization of DBD heart from both standard and extended criteria donors to increase the overall heart transplant volumes in the US, we intend to target 12 hours plus of OCS Heart perfusion using the NOP model to increase access to donor hearts and optimize the work working hours for our transplant program staff. We will also aim to prospectively randomized or OCSNOP. versus controlled cold static storage to assess the clinical value.\r\n We're planning not only to use our newly developed near physiologic OCS perfusion solution combined with blood. But in this particular program, we're adding a new proprietary metabolic enhancing therapeutic agents to maximize protection of the donor heart and improve its post-transplant clinical performance. From a timing perspective, we are targeting initiation some of this program sometimes around the end of 2024.\r\n And finally, our second heart program is a new program that will require a new technology from the ground up. It's aiming at OCS Heart called oxygenated perfusion for DBD hearts that are preserved for less than six hours. This program is designed to support a new FDA clinical indication for OCS Heart in the U.S. that will allow us to profuse and preserve standard criteria DBD heart for less than six hours, which is not our current clinical indications in the US. To do this, we are planning to offer a new lower-cost product that utilizes called oxygenated blood based perfusion technology. More specifically, we're developing our new pulsatile, fully portable cold perfusion technology and cold profusion circuitry to achieve easy to use system for use within our existing NOP. model.\r\n Again, we'll aim to prospectively randomized to hold controlled a controlled cold static storage to assess the clinical value, and we are targeting early 2025 to initiate this important clinical program. As you can see, we are advancing a very strong pipeline of clinical programs designed to drive significant growth in OCS case volume and the overall national cardiothoracic transplant volume in the US, however, we are not stopping here. We are also continuing to invest heavily in our next-gen OCS technology platform for all four for all three organs that will be highly automated optimized for NLP. workflow and designed to streamline the clinical support workload to allow us to continue to deliver the highest clinical quality of care and achieve better product leverage.\r\n We plan to share more details and details on this initiative later this year. To summarize, we are highly encouraged by our Q1 performance and our focus on several initiatives designed to further propel growth for TransMedics products and services. Given our strong performance in Q1, we are increasing our annual revenue guidance to 390 to $400 million, which represents 61% to 66% growth over full year 2023 revenue. With that, let me turn the call to Stephen to cover the detailed financial results for the quarter.\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nThank you, Waleed. I will now provide some additional detail on the Q1 results and other financial information for the quarter. Starting with revenue. For the first quarter of 2024, our total revenue was $96.9 million. This is an increase of 133% from the first quarter of 2023 and a 19% sequential increase from last quarter. The $96.9 million included $0.9 million related to our flight school. We have now exited all of the somewhat Legacy Charter business. So other than this 900 K from the flight school, all revenue is transplant related in the U.S. transplant revenue was $91.9 million. U.s. revenue increased 145% from the first quarter of 2023 and 22% sequentially from last quarter. And as Wally said, Q1 2024 revenue included $14.5 million of logistics revenue. The organ breakdown on U.S. revenue was $67 million of liver $1.2 million of heart and $4.7 million of loan. All organs growing substantially over Q1 2023 and sequentially from Q4 2023, ex U.S. revenue was $4.1 million, a 1% increase from Q1 of 2023 and a 16% sequential increase from last quarter. The ex U.S. breakdown was $3.1 million of heart and $1 million of luck.\r\n Next on the product and service revenue. As a reminder, our service revenue includes the added amounts we charge for the NOP. clinical service of surgical procurement and organ management and also includes the logistics revenue. The flight school is also included in service revenue. In Q1, product revenue was $61.3 million and service revenue was $35.5 million for the service portion was 36.7% of the total gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 62%. This is down from 69% in the first quarter of 2023 and up from 59% last quarter. In comparison to Q1 last year. This reflects the higher service component of our business, which did not include logistics in the first quarter last year. Product margin was 77% in Q1 recovering as expected to more normalized product margins from the 73% we saw in Q4, which included a one-time unfavorable IT service margin was 36%, improved from 35% last quarter as we continue to gain efficiency in our service offering.\r\n And as a reminder, all costs related to aviation, including fuel pilots, maintenance and depreciation are included on our service costs. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $47.5 million, 54% above Q1 2023 OpEx. This expense growth was driven by 94% growth in R&D related to investments in new product development and OP tools and products, quality and regulatory resources. Sg&a grew 45%, primarily related to higher personnel costs and overall corporate infrastructure. I want to point out that our operating expenses grew significantly throughout the year last year. So the year-on-year growth comparison next quarter, it should not be as pronounced as it was this quarter. Given the strong revenue and margin performance, we were able to deliver GAAP operating profit of $12.4 million or 13% of revenue net income was $12.2 million compared with an operating loss of $2.6 million and also a net loss of $2.6 million in Q1 of 2023 and basic earnings per share in the quarter was $0.37 and diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.35.\r\n Total cash at the end of the quarter was $350.2 million as of March 31st, 2024. This is down $44.6 million from December 31st, 2023, $39 million of cash was used to purchase three additional jets in Q1, bringing our total number of owned jets to 14 basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were $32.8 million and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were $34.7 million. In summary, Q1 was a very successful quarter financially for TransMedics, we grew our revenue both annually and sequentially, improved our gross margin and showed good drop down to profitability. All of this continues to validate our strategy of leveraging our NOP clinical service and logistics service to increase utilization of the Organ Care System and to increase the number of transplants in the U.S.\r\n Finally, just to repeat, while these earlier comment, we are updating our annual revenue guidance to be in the range of $390 million to $400 million, which represents 61% to 66% growth over the full year 2023. Now I will turn the call back to our lead for closing comments.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you, Stephen. Overall, we are humbled and proud of our Q1 results as we simultaneously drove continued revenue growth, expanded our infrastructure and achieve profitability while advancing our clinical and R&D pipelines. We're looking forward to continuing to execute on all the major initiatives throughout 2024 to drive broader adoption of OCSNOP. and growth of the overall transplant volumes to help patients in need of an organ transplant. With that, I will now turn the call to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Allen Gong, JPMorgan.\n\nAllen Gong\n\nThanks for the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter out of the gate. You know, I understand that no aviation likely help support, you know the beat in the services, but I think it was the beat in disposables that might be a little bit more surprising, given the fact that that kind of thing on a dollar basis relative to my forecast drove more of the upside. So I guess other than pull through of some of the NOP. cases that you were maybe previously losing due to the limitations of outside logistics, what else kind of went right in the quarter for you to drive these additional volumes?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you, Allen, for the question on a lot of things. When I went right in the first quarter and we hope to continue to execute in the same tone going forward, the most important thing is on the outcomes, the outcomes that are being achieved across the board. I'm now more transparent to the clinical users. Specifically, the liver continues to grow. They know but specifically for Heart and Lung, you know the the there was the Lund outcomes are getting better. Our team has been working very hard at them and educating the market demonstrating the better outcomes and achieved with our newer use model and it resonated in the quarter. Also, we're seeing the outcomes in heart is really helping growing the heart market and certainly the discouraging results. We heard at the ISHLT from the cold for Fusion. A study I may have may have fueled that, but it's really the outcomes that is driving our growth and we plan to continue to lean on outcomes.\r\n And that's why we are investing in these three major cardiothoracic programs deliver delivers is already there and continues to grow, and we will continue to add centers and go deeper within existing centers. So everything went right. Also the growth in the IT and the logistics business was important to help us get access to the cases that we couldn't get access to. That's also helped. But the fundamental growth from product is based basically in clinic based on clinical outcomes.\n\nAllen Gong\n\nGot it. And then a follow-up just kind of on seasonality and how we should think about that strength carrying forward? You know, if we kind of take the quarter, you just put up back it out of your updated guide really looks like you're setting your what should hopefully be a very achievable bar for the balance of the year, especially as you are now, you're adding more planes, you're going to be starting the quarter with more planes than used you had on average in first quarter. So why is this kind of a right target to go with and how should we think about the seasonal cadence implied by that guidance should be relatively flat? I guess why would that be the case? I should yield the growth sequentially.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you. Thanks, Alan. And I think they know there's there's many layers to answering that question, Allan and Stephen, please comment as well from your perspective, I think we as we always are cognizant of what potential operational challenges in front of us. For example, we are very proud to have up operating 14 planes, hopefully in Q2, but we know that in the second half of the year. We have some of these planes are due for some annual service, so they're not going to be accessible to us. And so we factor that into the guidance. We also factor in some of the, you know, any potential seasonality from summer vacations coming up or the holidays. So we always are prudent when it comes to guidance we want we want to when we issue guidance, we we take it very seriously.\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nSo that's layered into our expectations here even for now, I would just say, look, we don't expect a down quarter sequentially. We expect modest growth quarter over quarter, and that's the way we've modeled it. And I would expect that's what will come. And also and finally, and to put a bracket around that. We're operating from a much bigger starting point now. So we have we have to be cognizant of that.\n\nAllen Gong\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nJosh Jennings, TD Cowen.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nHi, good evening. It's great to see such an impressive start to the year. I was hoping that will lead to just circle back on the discussion we had earlier in the quarter, just about you have you have a lot of you have seen a lot of pipeline initiatives initiatives both on the technology front and on the clinical development front. But just how should we be thinking about the OCS system potentially reducing the percentage of DCO donors, DCD donors that do not progress in heart liver and lung, and is that something that could happen in the next 12 to 24 months?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nAnd Josh, that's exactly our goal. As we discussed this is the only system that we're aware of that exist out there that could help that picture.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nAre those?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nYes. So with that's something we're planning to leverage over the next 12 to 24 months for sure. And we're hoping that once we launch these clinical programs, that becomes an opening on to the next program being focused on specifically growing the DCD. utilization.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nExcellent. And then another topic just in with ILTS. kicking off this week, wanted to just ask about just get a better understanding on the benefits and if there are advantages of using OCS. a warm for North America for Fusion and fatty livers and just the percentage of donors that have fatty livers and how dramatic a difference there is in preservation of OCS. versus cold storage or even cold paper oxygenated perfusion. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you. bThank you, Josh, and thank you for asking the question. It's a very important question. Without running the risk of burning some of the key planning session presentations at the upcoming Altius and the community should be expecting that we will reveal data that shows our clinical superiority of fatty livers using one profusion compared to any other modality. And I'll leave it at that. It doesn't make sense to put fatty livers on ice, whether through perfusion or controlled or non-controlled static cold storage, it just doesn't make any sense because fat cells with cold storage or any cold and a form of preservation can deals and then the liver becomes more of a foreign object and a physiologic body. So we're looking forward to the to our investigators and lead users to present presenting this data at the plenary session on Saturday.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nAnd sorry to sneak a follow up. And but just any help just thinking about the percentage of donor livers that are fatty imagine it's a sizable chunk of the donor pool. Thanks a lot.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nIt's very it's very it's a very sizable chunk. And again, the definition of fatty, it's varied some people consider fatty liver, anything greater than 15% will be presenting data on fatty liver greater than 25% or 30% even. So we experienced the full gamut and again, there is a tremendous evidence supporting warm perfusion on OCS platform are having superior outcomes to any other modality for preservation of fatty livers. And I'll leave it at that, Josh, thanks much.\n\nOperator\n\nWilliam Plovanic, Canaccord.\n\nWilliam Plovanic\n\nJohn on for Will tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to first touch on the aviation know you said 80% with probably the term rate of direct cases that can be supported by you and what services and what level of jets are needed to reach the 80%? And when could we see that?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nAnd thank you. Thank you, John. And we think that at the current estimates, we think somewhere between 25 and 30 planes will get us there, but we fully expect to increase those estimates beyond 10,000 on so far. That's that's our expectation.\r\n And the key for us is to build enough in this Phase two to continue to demonstrate the growth. And as we need more, we will we will have more planes on. But right now we're hoping to end this year around 20 between 15 and 20 planes and hopefully by end of next year to be between 25 and 30. And then we'll we'll assess from there.\n\nWilliam Plovanic\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe more for Stephen, but any any operating profit cadence or guidance for the remainder of this year?\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nSo hey, John, this is Steven. On the hub I'm not prepared to give any guidance other than we're pleased with where we came out in Q1, and we hope we're on path to the hubbing sustainable profit going forward because we're a little bit of ahead of where we thought we'd be. So but that's about all I can say at this point.\n\nWilliam Plovanic\n\nGreat. Thanks, Neena. Going to squeeze one more in here. But while we might limit the cold chain for fusions and for hard for us to only six hours, especially with the competitor cases, there are notably going much longer than that thinking I'm taking your questions.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you, John and John, you heard you heard the outcomes with me and they failed that trial in Europe. So why would I subject and us too to bad outcomes. And we are more sensible where we want to protect the outcome for the patient. So and we're providing this as a lower-cost solution for this small segment of the market that is below six hours and for longer hours, we hope to prove it based on the new heart program that warm perfusion is a better solution than core perfusion.\r\n And that's the rationale for why we're limiting it, at least based on an indication standpoint. And remember, all of the data that we heard that ICOP is not an FDA level data for all fewer few centers, handful of cases up except for the European multicenter trial that failed the primary effectiveness endpoint.\n\nWilliam Plovanic\n\nGot it. Thank you again.\n\nOperator\n\nSuraj Kalia, Oppenheimer.\n\nSuraj Kalia\n\nWhile these Can you hear me. All right. Yes, gentlemen, congrats again on a blockbuster quarter. So really just want to go back on one of the points that you made at our conference a month or so ago. And even on this call you you were talking about them generation trial So will you stratify for us the standard criteria, DBD heart that are technically off label for you all today? Just so that people can compare and contrast as to what the denominator should be in terms of market penetration also will the trial that you mentioned that would be beginning, I believe you said next year, early next year that is called profusion But would it also have is the logic behind?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nAnd thank you, Suraj, for the questions. So let me address I'll address this in multiple multiple points. First, right now, our FDA approved indication does not cover standard criteria. Dbd hearts. Our plan is to have an new indication to cover that. And is it four hours is six hours. The market segment of between less than four hours is about 900. If you go down to up to six hours, about maybe 1,200 transplants plus or minus some at least that's based on last year's number. The reality is we want to access this segment of the market, no matter how big or how small it is. We want to be two years from now every heart transplanted in this country should be preserved on a TransMedics technology, whether cold perfusion for warm perfusion. It will be at TransMedics technology and we want to have the full gamut of FDA indications like we have it for lung and we have it for liver. So that's number one.\r\n Number two, we have two heart programs, one one, focusing on therapeutic and optimization modalities for DBD donors and one called the warm we expect to start before year end this year, the coal because it requires a full-blown new system and full new circuitry will start in the first half or beginning of 2025. And that is the one that is focused in the new FDA clinical indication. I hope I addressed the question.\n\nSuraj Kalia\n\nFair enough. And so and there is one segment I apologize, Suraj. Yes, it will be pulsatile and the cold perfusion will be positive, which is a distinguishing factor that we have that nobody else has FairPoint. Okay, Steve, and one question for you and I'll hop back in queue. One of the questions that frequently comes up in investor discussions is and maybe you can quantify this a little better for everyone's consumption. And the question that comes up is, hey, how does TransMedics depreciate its planes? What are it's all in as per our for aviation, how are the margins where they are would love for you to take all of these and wrap it up into some numerics and there are numbers that people can slice and dice because Gentlemen, congrats again. Thank you for taking my questions.\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nThanks, Suraj. Was a question I can answer. It is how we depreciate. So we depreciate the planes over 10 years with a 50% of our residual value. So that has been we've been clear from day one that's in our Q's and K's. We haven't talked about the margin of the aviation versus the margin of the service. But all in, we're at that 36% and we expect some improvement. Certainly, I can say the the aviation is a bit on the lower side versus the service, which is a bit on the higher than that side. But we haven't talked about anything more detailed than that. So that's but So well, I can answer that question.\n\nOperator\n\n[Jackson], William Blair.\n\nYes, hey, guys. This is Jackson on for Ryan, Daniel, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong start to the year. Can you share any general feedback from customers that have used TransMedics aviation and maybe if or how that feedback has changed since you began integrating the aviation segment?\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you for the question on. I think the only thing that I can share publicly is just if I point out to the results, I point out to the their rapid pace by which we went from 0 to 105 customers are using our TransMedics logistical services and we expect to go deeper within these accounts. And I'll leave it at that. I think centers are beginning or are actually witnessing the at the better structure. The more efficient cost structure and availability that is afforded by TransMedics logistics. And again, I point to the results.\n\nUnderstood, thank you. Can you just provide an update on what you're seeing in the international markets and kind of what the expectations are there? And just as a quick follow-up into, are there any like encouraging opportunities following the ISHLT. meetings that took place.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThanks to excellent question and thank you for asking it. And there is a tremendous focus on the success of NOP in the United States that are many major European countries are coming to TransMedics and offering to collaborate on establishing and OPs across Europe. We're seeing similar behavior in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, we had several discussions about essential piece. The way I want to characterize it is absolutely we're focusing on replicating the success of the NOP because we believe the problem that the NOP solves for in the US is exactly the same problem ex ex U.S. However, we want to prioritize securing reimbursement first to make sure that our services will get reimbursed. And one final qualifier when I talk about NOPXU. S, we're talking only on the clinical support service, not no logistics and no surgical procurement, just for clarification purposes. So yes, there's a huge, huge momentum around NOP replication for US., and we TransMedics fully expect to be ready to implement those once we are confident that our services will be reimbursed.\n\nPerfect. Thanks guys, and congrats again, gentlemen.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) [Samantha], Piper Sandler.\n\nHi, this is Samantha on for Matt. Thank you so much for taking our question. I guess just to start off, if you could talk a little bit more about guidance. So guidance for the rest of the year and kind of what's baked into that low end and high end of that range as Samantha?\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nThis is Stephen. Yes, I mean we think there's opportunity to continue to kind of grow sequentially, as I mentioned in answer to the earlier call, and if we're able to, you know, add up or go deeper in a few of our centers, we should be able to get to that high end and some of these things that will come to fruition and until the low end is just being a little bit more conservative about the pace of how we do that. So it's a pretty narrow range, and we feel confident that we'll be able to meet it.\n\nOkay, thank you. And then just one more from us on I know you've talked a little bit in the past about the expected product service mix and totally expect that to change throughout the year, particularly from Yes, but I can do more. Yes, aircraft throughout the year.\n\nStephen Gordon\n\nYes. So it's a good question. We've been kind of keeping an eye on the product and service mix. It ended up from 36.7% service. I think it's going to get a little bit more than that. It might be between, say between 37 to potentially 39%. I think that's probably the top end was a little higher than I had given some of you earlier in the year based on the outcomes we're seeing, but we still think we're going to see overall gross margin continued to improve.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Waleed Hassanein for closing remarks.\n\nWaleed Hassanein\n\nThank you so much, operator, thank you so much, everybody, for joining us in this call this evening, and we're looking forward to our next call. Have a wonderful evening, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.\n\nView comments",

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TMDX.\n\nRelease Date: April 30, 2024\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Thanks for the question and congratulations on a really strong quarter out of the gate. Other than pull through of some of the NOP cases that you were maybe previously losing due to the limitations of outside logistics, what else kind of went right in the quarter for you to drive these additional volumes? A: (Waleed Hassanein - President and CEO, Transmedics Group, Inc.) Thank you, Allen, for the question. A lot of things went right in the first quarter, and we hope to continue to execute in the same tone going forward. The most important thing is the outcomes that are being achieved across the board are now more transparent to the clinical users. Specifically, the liver continues to grow, but specifically for Heart and Lung, the outcomes are getting better. Our team has been working very hard at educating the market, demonstrating the better outcomes achieved with our newer use model, and it resonated in the quarter. Also, we're seeing that the outcomes in heart are really helping grow the heart market.\n\nQ: Hi, good evening. It's great to see such an impressive start to the year. I was hoping that Waleed could just circle back on the discussion we had earlier in the quarter, just about you have you have a lot of pipeline initiatives both on the technology front and on the clinical development front. But just how should we be thinking about the OCS system potentially reducing the percentage of DCO donors, DCD donors that do not progress in heart liver and lung, and is that something that could happen in the next 12 to 24 months? A: (Waleed Hassanein - President and CEO, Transmedics Group, Inc.) And Josh, that's exactly our goal. As we discussed, this is the only system that we're aware of that exists out there that could help that picture. That's something we're planning to leverage over the next 12 to 24 months for sure. And we're hoping that once we launch these clinical programs, that becomes an opening on to the next program being focused on specifically growing the DCD utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ: John on for Will tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to first touch on the aviation. You said 80% with probably the term rate of direct cases that can be supported by you and what services and what level of jets are needed to reach the 80%? And when could we see that? A: (Waleed Hassanein - President and CEO, Transmedics Group, Inc.) Thank you, John. We think that at the current estimates, we think somewhere between 25 and 30 planes will get us there, but we fully expect to increase those estimates beyond 10,000 on so far. That's our expectation. The key for us is to build enough in this Phase two to continue to demonstrate the growth. And as we need more, we will have more planes on. But right now we're hoping to end this year around 20 between 15 and 20 planes and hopefully by end of next year to be between 25 and 30. And then we'll assess from there.\n\nQ: While these Can you hear me. All right. Yes, gentlemen, congrats again on a blockbuster quarter. So really just want to go back on one of the points that you made at our conference a month or so ago. And even on this call you were talking about them generation trial So will you stratify for us the standard criteria, DBD heart that are technically off label for you all today? Just so that people can compare and contrast as to what the denominator should be in terms of market penetration also will the trial that you mentioned that would be beginning, I believe you said next year, early next year that is called profusion But would it also have is the logic behind? A: (Waleed Hassanein - President and CEO, Transmedics Group, Inc.) Thank you, Suraj, for the questions. So let me address this in multiple points. First, right now, our FDA approved indication does not cover standard criteria. Dbd hearts. Our plan is to have an new indication to cover that. And is it four hours is six hours. The market segment of between less than four hours is about 900. If you go down to up to six hours, about maybe 1,200 transplants plus or minus some at least that's based on last year's number. The reality is we want to access this segment of the market, no matter how big or how small it is. We want to be two years from now every heart transplanted in this country should be preserved on a TransMedics technology, whether cold perfusion for warm perfusion. It will be at TransMedics technology and we want to have the full gamut of FDA indications like we have it for lung and we have it for liver. So that's number one.\n\nQ: Yes, hey, guys. This is Jackson on for Ryan, Daniel, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong start to the year. Can you share any general feedback from customers that have used TransMedics aviation and maybe if or how that feedback has changed since you began integrating the aviation segment? A: (Waleed Hassanein - President and CEO, Transmedics Group, Inc.) Thank you for the question on. I think the only thing that I can share publicly is just if I point out to the results, I point out to the their rapid pace by which we went from 0 to 105 customers are using our TransMedics logistical services and we expect to go deeper within these accounts.

        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.05 per share. This compares to loss of $0.08 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 800%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical technology company would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of 250%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nTransMedics , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $96.85 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $41.55 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nTransMedics shares have added about 23.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for TransMedics?\n\nWhile TransMedics has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for TransMedics: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.08 on $88.09 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.14 on $367.24 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Instruments is currently in the bottom 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Avinger (AVGR), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nThis medical device maker is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +87.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nAvinger's revenues are expected to be $2.36 million, up 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The increase in operating expense was driven primarily by increased research and development investment as well as investment throughout the organization to support the growth of the company.

        "title": "Should Lifeward (LFWD) be in Your Portfolio Ahead of Q1 Earnings?",
        "content": "ReWalk Robotics Ltd. LFWD, or Lifeward, is expected to release first-quarter 2024 results soon.\n\nThe company posted a loss of 35 cents per share in the last reported quarter, much narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents. In each of the trailing four quarters, Lifeward beat earnings estimates, with an average surprise of 32.47%.\n\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.\n\nFactors to Benefit LFWD in Q1\n\nLifeward\u2019s transformation from ReWalk Robotics signifies its broader goal of enhancing the standard of care, empowering individuals with physical limitations and disabilities to pursue their passions. After headlining some milestone achievements in 2023, such as gaining Medicare payment for exoskeletons, acquiring commercially successful and highly innovative antigravity products and ongoing technology leadership with new products, the medical device maker has paved the way for exciting growth and expansion this year.\n\nWith the addition of AlterG, Lifeward is strategically emerging as the largest U.S. field organization in the exoskeleton industry, possessing both financial size and the infrastructure for the furthest reach and highest quality of support for the industry. Given the integration of the commercial and operational resources of the former ReWalk and AlterG businesses is now successfully complete, we expect this to boost the company\u2019s first-quarter revenues significantly.\n\nLifeward\u2019s anticipated revenue growth in 2024 incorporates a full year of AlterG business contribution, augmented by the planned mid-year launch of a new entry-level AlterG model. Furthermore, in the Q1 months, the company may have begun to cut its quarterly operating losses through revenue growth, increasing gross margin contributions, more cost-saving initiatives and synergistic expense management with a broader product offering.\n\nGlamorous Bigger Picture\n\nWhile the above factors should strongly add to the company\u2019s results in the to-be-reported quarter, there are more to consider.\n\nLifeward is currently poised to benefit from CMS\u2019 (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) recent finalization of the payment rate for the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton for 2024, effective Apr 1. The decision enables physicians to confidently prescribe the exoskeleton, with the clarity that Medicare patients will have an established reimbursement pathway. It is also worth noting that Lifeward has reported a debt-free balance sheet over the past several quarters, holding sufficient resources to fund multiple years of organic growth while making acquisitions of adjacent product lines.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a market cap of $40.37 million, Lifeward stands as a top player in the more-than 1-billion worth global medical exoskeleton market. The company boasts a history of innovative firsts \u2014 including the first to bring a personal exoskeleton to the market with both FDA and CE approval, the first to commercially apply NASA-derived Differential Air Pressure Technology, and now, the first to achieve Medicare coverage for a personal exoskeleton. Its flagship offering, the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton technology, received FDA clearance in 2023 for use on stairs and curbs following its designation as a \"Breakthrough Device\" for helping paralyzed individuals with SCI (spinal cord injury).\n\nThe ReBoot soft exo-suit, which received the FDA\u2019s Breakthrough Device designation in November 2021, is currently under evaluation for the reimbursement landscape and its potential clinical impact. The product complements the ReStore Exo-Suit device, which the company began commercializing in June 2019. Since 2020, Lifeward has held an exclusive U.S. Distribution Agreement with MYOLYN, through which it distributes the MyoCycle Functional Electrical Stimulation (\u201cFES\u201d) Pro cycles to U.S. rehabilitation clinics and MyoCycle Home cycles to U.S. veterans through Veterans Health Administration (\u201cVHA\u201d) hospitals. These additional product lines have enhanced Lifeward\u2019s offerings to clinics as well as VHA patients, both having similar clinician and patient profiles.\n\nFigures Show Bullish Trajectory Ahead\n\nOver the past year, LFWD has mostly outperformed by gaining 8.8% compared with the industry\u2019s 4.7% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEstimates for Lifeward\u2019s 2024 loss have narrowed to $1.75 from $1.82 per share in the past 30 days. The company delivered record annual revenues of $13.9 million in 2023, a stupendous increase of 151% from the 2022 annual figure. On a more optimistic note, the Zacks Consensus Estimate shows a staggering 351.2% rise for the company\u2019s 2024 first-quarter revenues from the 2023 comparable figure.\n\nOur Take\n\nIn conclusion, LFWD is a buy ahead of its first-quarter results as earnings estimate revisions continue to rise for both 2024 and 2025.\n\nLifeward\u2019s ongoing technological advancements and commercial operations have positioned it well to achieve its market goals. Backed by its track record of achieving numerous strategic milestones, we are optimistic about the company\u2019s ability to deliver life-changing technology while simultaneously maintaining financial success. Hence, right now, Lifeward is a good stock for investors to consider.\n\nZacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider\n\nLifeward currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nHere are some other medical stocks worth considering:\n\nTransMedics Group TMDX sports a Zacks Rank #1.

        "title": "TransMedics (TMDX) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: Here's Why",
        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with TransMedics (TMDX) standing at $88.88, reflecting a -1.9% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.02%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.11%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.1%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the medical technology company had gained 21.63% over the past month. This has outpaced the Medical sector's loss of 4.52% and the S&P 500's loss of 3.01% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of TransMedics in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on April 30, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.05, up 37.5% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $83.32 million, showing a 100.52% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of -$0.14 per share and revenue of $367.24 million, which would represent changes of +81.82% and +51.99%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for TransMedics. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 39.73% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, TransMedics possesses a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nThe Medical - Instruments industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, putting it in the top 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "title": "LivaNova (LIVN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "LivaNova (LIVN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis medical technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $277.03 million, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LivaNova?\n\nFor LivaNova, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.74%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LivaNova will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that LivaNova would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.87, delivering a surprise of +10.13%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nLivaNova doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\n\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, TransMedics (TMDX) is soon expected to post loss of $0.05 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +37.5%.

        "title": "Insulet (PODD) Awaits Q1 Earnings Release: Here's What to Expect",
        "content": "Insulet PODD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2024 results on May 9 after market close.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $1.40 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a remarkable 108.96%. Earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 100.09%.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.\n\nFactors at Play\n\nIn 2023, Insulet firmly established itself as the market leader in automated insulin delivery (AID), achieving its eighth consecutive year of above 20% revenue growth and dollar growth of nearly $400 million. With a strong momentum in 2024 and several catalysts ahead, the company is incredibly well-positioned for continued growth and can efficiently scale its business in each of the quarters of 2024.\n\nIn the first quarter, particularly, Insulet may have achieved significant margin expansion by leveraging its global market opportunities and investments in innovations. The company's focus on long-term value creation for shareholders and meeting customer commitments may have significantly favored its top-line performance in the quarter under review.\n\nInsulet Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Insulet Corporation Price and EPS Surprise\n\nInsulet Corporation price-eps-surprise | Insulet Corporation Quote\n\nThe Omnipod product platform is expected to deliver another quarter of robust revenues following its milestone of 25% growth in 2023 for its active global customer base. Strong U.S. Omnipod market growth may have been driven by the company\u2019s annuity-based model and growing pharmacy volume, including an increasing volume contribution from the Omnipod 5 AID system and the related premium for pods in the U.S. pharmacy. Insulet\u2019s breakthrough offering is a key driver of growth, further establishing its dominance and expertise in the diabetes market.\n\nFurthermore, Omnipod 5 is likely to have represented a vast majority of new customer starts in the first quarter of 2024, along with strong customer retention. Nearly 250,000 customers are reported to have utilized Omnipod 5 last year. We assume the company to have capitalized on its biggest opportunity by shifting customers to Omnipod from MDI (multiple daily injections). Through driving continuous pump penetration and gaining share in both the type 1 and type 2 markets, Insulet may have further strengthened its leadership position and delivered robust revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nAdditionally, Omnipod 5\u2019s broader appeal may have been demonstrated by a growing number of scripts written by healthcare providers. In February 2024, Insulet secured a major milestone by gaining CE Mark approval for Omnipod 5 integration with Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus Sensor. The company is likely to have progressed toward launching this integrated offering in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in the first half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nInsulet also initiated its limited U.S. market rollout of Omnipod 5 with G7, aiming to test the market and scale up production for a successful full G7 market launch later this year. These developments are likely to have made a positive impact on its 2024 first-quarter performance.\n\nSimultaneously, Omnipod DASH may have continued to hold its momentum in the Type 2 diabetes market. International Omnipod revenue growth is likely to have surpassed the company\u2019s expectations for the to-be-reported quarter, backed by the continued strong Omnipod DASH adoption and Omnipod 5\u2019s contribution in the U.K. and Germany.\n\nGoing by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Insulet\u2019s Total Omnipod revenues are expected to increase 17.9% year over year in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nQ1 Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $423.5 million, which suggests an 18.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s first-quarter 2024 earnings per share of 39 cents indicates a staggering 69.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Insulet shares have underperformed the industry. The stock has decreased 21% compared to the industry\u2019s 7.1% rise. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Our Model Suggests\n\nPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates, which is the case here:\n\nEarnings ESP: Insulet has an Earnings ESP of +11.11%.

        "title": "TransMedics (TMDX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?",
        "content": "TransMedics (TMDX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis medical technology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.5%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $83.32 million, up 100.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 32.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TransMedics?\n\nFor TransMedics, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +240%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that TransMedics will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that TransMedics would post a loss of $0.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of +250%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nTransMedics appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, Integer (ITGR), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.12 per share for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +28.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $413.29 million, up 9.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Integer has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Integer will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at TransMedics Group (NASDAQ:TMDX) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TransMedics Group:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.00075 = US$485k \u00f7 (US$706m - US$55m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, TransMedics Group has an ROCE of 0.07%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.6%.\n\nView our latest analysis for TransMedics Group  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TransMedics Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for TransMedics Group .\n\nWhat Does the ROCE Trend For TransMedics Group Tell Us?\n\nTransMedics Group has recently broken into profitability so their prior investments seem to be paying off. Shareholders would no doubt be pleased with this because the business was loss-making five years ago but is is now generating 0.07% on its capital. In addition to that, TransMedics Group is employing 2,111% more capital than previously which is expected of a company that's trying to break into profitability. We like this trend, because it tells us the company has profitable reinvestment opportunities available to it, and if it continues going forward that can lead to a multi-bagger performance.\n\nOn a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 7.8%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. So shareholders would be pleased that the growth in returns has mostly come from underlying business performance.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nLong story short, we're delighted to see that TransMedics Group's reinvestment activities have paid off and the company is now profitable. Since the stock has returned a staggering 253% to shareholders over the last three years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you'd like to know about the risks facing TransMedics Group, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this freelist of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Long-Term Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for April 2024",
        "content": "Whether you believe them or not, analyst ratings have long been a strong indicator of the stock price\u2019s direction. There is a direct correlation between how Wall Street analysts rate a stock and how it performs. After all, analysts aren\u2019t just pulling these price targets out of thin air. They use complex formulas that include analyzing the company\u2019s past and present fundamentals to predict its future price multiple.\n\nSo should we blindly follow analyst ratings or price targets? We shouldn\u2019t ever just rely on one rating to buy a stock. Rather, we should use analyst ratings as one indicator combined with other research like fundamentals and technical analysis. If you are looking for some stocks to watch in April, check out these Wall Street analyst favorites.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. As of April 2024, Meta is the seventh-largest company in the world by market cap with a value of $1.3 trillion. Meta is a favorite of Wall Street analysts and is currently trading right at its average price target of $519.12. The top end of the price target range sits at $600.00, representing a further 14% upside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn March alone, Meta received 60 analyst ratings, 20 of which were a Strong Buy with 32 more being a Buy rating. This is almost as consensus as it gets among Wall Street analysts. Meta has more than two billion daily active users (DAU) across its platforms and has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the past five years.\n\nDespite gaining more than 145% over the past year, Meta\u2019s stock has gotten cheaper on a price multiple basis. It is now trading at just 10x sales and 26x forward earnings. This makes Meta cheaper than peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber (NYSE:UBER) is the global leader in ride-sharing with over 130 million monthly active users in more than 70 countries worldwide. The stock has an average price target of $86.56 from analysts which represents an 11% upside from Uber\u2019s current price. The Street-high analyst price target is $100 per share.\n\nEarlier this year, Uber reported its first-ever profitable quarter. This came on the heels of Uber being added to the S&P 500 just a couple of months earlier in December 2023. Now, with the company finally at scale and its delivery growth soaring, analysts are calling Uber a stock to buy. In March, 45 of 48 analyst ratings were a Buy or Strong Buy which indicates just how much Wall Street loves this stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsually, there are some valuation concerns after a stock has gained 143% over the past year. It depends on which metric you use with Uber. The stock is trading at a lofty 60x forward earnings but only four times sales. This divergence is usually caused by rapidly growing revenue with minimal profits, which is exactly the case for Uber. Its revenue has grown at a three-year CAGR of 50%!\n\nTransMedics Group (TMDX) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) is an American medical device and technology company that was founded in 1998. This stock isn\u2019t the most widely covered company, but analysts do have an average price target of $99.40. TMDX is currently trading at a lower price than the lowest end of the one-year analyst price target range of $95.00.\n\nThis company has a market cap of just $2.8 billion and is far from being profitable, but a deeper dive tells you exactly why analysts love this stock. TMDX is the largest ex-vivo organ transplantation company in the world. It designs and implements new technologies to safely transport organs from donors to patients. Some analysts with an Overweight or Strong Buy rating include Oppenheimer, TD Cowen, and most recently initiated by Piper Sandler.\n\nDespite being unprofitable and in hyper-growth mode, TMDX only trades at 11.4x sales even after seeing year-over-year revenue growth of 158.7%. Over the past three years, TMDX has seen a revenue CAGR of 111%. TMDX is an industry leader growing at an exponential rate and it is only a matter of time until the stock price follows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The bull market continues, and the S&P 500 is hardly giving up any gains. Indeed, the momentum from the October 2023 lows has been incredible. As market breadth expands beyond AI stocks and the Magnificent Seven, growth stocks have upside.\n\nOn a macro level, the market will continue to be supported by solid economic data and strong technical momentum. The economy is still surprising to the upside with solid GDP growth and healthy employment numbers. Therefore, company earnings will remain resilient, supporting continued gains.\n\nWith a positive macro backdrop, the following growth stocks to buy have room to run higher. Each achieved 30% annual revenue growth over the last five years. Additionally, according to Finviz, they managed 10% quarter-over-quarter (QOQ) sales growth in the most recent quarter.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking ahead, management is optimistic about prospects. What\u2019s more, they are reasonably valued at a forward EV/Sales below 10.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis build-it-yourself video game platform has proved to be a hit among users. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) had another healthy year, growing revenues by 26% in 2023. Bookings were $3.5 billion, increasing 23% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nIndeed, 2023 results revealed the company\u2019s excellent user growth. Daily active users hit 68.4 million for the full year, growing 22% year-over-year. Also, average monthly unique payers rose 17% to 14.5 million.\n\nEven better, Roblox grew its 13-and-over DAUs by 28% in Q4 2023. Now, over 58% of DAUs are in this category, which is a positive for the advertising business the company is trying to ramp up. Additionally, the company ended Q4 2023 with the strongest quarterly bookings growth.\n\nAlso, Roblox is an under-the-radar AI opportunity. It announced Roblox Assistant, which allows users to generate ideas using natural language text prompts. On the operations front, they are using AI to lower costs and improve safety on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, Roblox is one of the top growth stocks to buy at 6 times forward EV/Sales.

Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is disrupting the cosmetics industry and taking share as it does so. Its core value proposition is offering clean, vegan and cruelty-free cosmetics at a lower price point. Indeed, while the average prices for legacy and prestige brands are $9 and $20, respectively, its products cost about $6.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering this value proposition, it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s a top brand among teens. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s 47th Semi-Annual Taking Stock With Teens, released on April 9, the brand is number 1. e.l.f. Beauty dominates the category and grew market share by 16 points YOY to 38%.\n\nSo, these market share gains have translated into impressive revenue growth numbers for the cosmetic brand. On February 6, it reported Q3 fiscal year 2024 results, delivering 85% growth. Even better, it gained 305 basis points in market share. Therefore, this was the 20th quarter in a row of revenues and market share growth.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is one of the best growth stocks to buy today. Its innovative engine has produced the number one or two positioned brands across 16 categories in color cosmetics. After Ulta Beauty\u2019s (NASDAQ:ULTA) negative commentary, ELF stock declined to $170. This selloff is an opportunity as e.l.f. Beauty remains the most productive brand at Ulta Beauty, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients.

TransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) Organ Care System is a portable organ perfusion system that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2021. The system replicates the physiologic conditions for donor organs outside the human body and is approved for lungs, hearts and livers.\n\nIts National OCS Program (NOP) comprises approximately 200 surgical and clinical personnel in hubs in the U.S., supporting access and delivery of donor organs. Furthermore, the company has built a dedicated fleet of modern jets to ease access to distant donors. Notably, most transplant centers are opting for the service instead of their teams due to better clinical outcomes and lower costs.\n\nBecause of the company\u2019s technology, there was a 12% increase in heart and liver transplantation last year. For instance, Tufts Medical Center performed a record 61 adult heart transplants in 2023, attributing the success to TransMedics. As a result, revenues are soaring and 2024 could be another year of outperformance.\n\nIn 2023, revenues were $241.6 million, representing 159% growth from 2022.

        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nThe earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. TransMedics (TMDX) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.02 a share, just 26 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 6, 2024.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the -$0.02 Most Accurate Estimate and the -$0.05 Zacks Consensus Estimate, TransMedics has an Earnings ESP of 60%.\n\nTMDX is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) as well.\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 16, 2024. JNJ's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.65 a share six days from its next earnings release.\n\nFor Johnson & Johnson, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63 is 0.6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, TMDX and JNJ could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "title": "2 Potentially Explosive Stocks to Buy in April",
        "content": "What's the most important ingredient for investing successfully? Time. However, some stocks require much less time to deliver huge returns than others.\n\nYou may have to be patient for significant returns if you invest in stocks that are about to announce major news or are entering a new growth phase. Here are two potentially explosive stocks to buy in April.\n\n1. Viking Therapeutics\n\nViking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) has already delivered explosive gains in 2024. The biotech stock is up nearly 330% year to date, but I think it has much more room to run.\n\nThe good news in February from a phase 2b study of experimental obesity drug VK2735 provided Viking's first big catalyst of the year. The company reported the injectable formulation of the drug helped patients achieve up to 13.1% placebo-adjusted mean weight loss after 13 weeks of treatment.\n\nOnly four weeks later, Viking announced more positive news. A tablet version of VK2735 achieved a placebo-adjusted mean weight loss of up to 3.3% after 28 days of treatment in a phase 1 study. The company plans to advance the oral formulation of the drug into a phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe obesity drug market could reach or even top $100 billion by 2030, according to some Wall Street analysts. Viking appears to be on the right track to claim a significant share of that market within the next few years.\n\nIn the meantime, the company could have another major catalyst coming soon. Viking expects to announce histology results from its phase 2b study evaluating VK2809 in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) -- also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) -- in the first half of 2024. NASH/MASH is another massive potential market, with some analysts predicting over $100 billion in drug sales by 2030.\n\n2. TransMedics Group\n\nTransMedics Group(NASDAQ: TMDX) hasn't been as explosive as Viking. Its shares are down so far in 2024, but I predict this medical device stock will rebound strongly.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company markets the Organ Care System (OCS), an innovative way to transport donor lungs, hearts, and kidneys. High percentages of donated organs don't make it to their intended recipients with the current standard of care -- cold storage. OCS addresses this problem and significantly reduces post-transplant complications.\n\nAnother major challenge for organ transplants was the unavailability of planes to transport organs. TransMedics tackled this problem head-on with its 2023 acquisition of charter-flight operator Summit Aviation. The company now has a fleet of airplanes dedicated to transporting organs.\n\nProbably the main reason TransMedics stock isn't flying high right now is recent allegations made by Paul Gosar, who represents Arizona's ninth Congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Gosar accused TransMedics of requiring hospitals to purchase a minimum number of OCS devices, prohibiting transplant centers from training their staffs on OCS, and using its National OCS Program (NOP) to reduce access as a way to boost profits.\n\nTransMedics strongly disputed Gosar's allegations. The company made a good case for its position, in my opinion. I think this issue will likely prove to be much ado about nothing. I also expect significant growth when TransMedics reports its first-quarter results (probably in late May).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in TransMedics Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in TransMedics Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and TransMedics Group wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stock Recommendations. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nJim Cramer yet again grilled market naysayers in his latest program on CNBC, calling them \u201cnon-believers\u201d who he believes only got encouraged by the recent market declines. Cramer said first the bears warned everyone about the inflationary cycle after the pandemic, then they \u201chated\u201d the market amid the regional banking crisis, upping their calls for a hard landing following the Fed\u2019s rate hikes.\n\nJim Cramer's Message to the \"Nonbelievers\"\n\nJim Cramer said all along these bears \u201cfailed to celebrate the market\u2019s incredible victories\u201d and they \u201cignored\u201d the \u201cend of high inflation.\u201d\n\nJim Cramer also said that initially the market bears complained about the concentration of market gains in the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, which include companies like \u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), but later ignored when the gains started to \u201cbifurcate\u201d to the broader market including small-cap and mid-cap stocks which Cramer believes are still \u201ccheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with these people,\u201d Cramer said about market skeptics.\n\nIs AI a Bubble? Cramer's Take\n\nJim Cramer also said that while market doubters called AI a bubble, they ignored crypto which Cramer believes was an \u201cobvious bubble.\u201d Cramer said many believe crypto is a hedge against inflation but when inflation was very high crypto performed \u201chorribly.\u201d\n\nNonetheless Cramer admitted that crypto\u2019s \u201crelative worth\u201d against the US dollar is \u201cpalpable\u201d and it \u201cmakes sense\u201d that people are investing in crypto ETFs to hedge against inflation.\n\nJim Cramer also talked about AI and how some people are calling it a bubble. Cramer said while there are some companies in the industry that are \u201cover inflated\u201d not all AI companies are bubbles. Cramer reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said the stock is undervalued. Cramer said you have to have a historical context to understand and analyze Nvidia. He said that last year NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was apparently overvalued based on the Wall Street\u2019s earnings estimates. Cramer said the company\u2019s 2024 earnings estimates set by Wall Street analysts are still low and that\u2019s why he believes the stock has more room to run.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIt is undisputed that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the king of AI,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nIn the end, Cramer recommended investors to build up their cash piles and be ready to buy when there\u2019s a pullback.

Cramer thinks Softbank would sell Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares on lockup expiration and said that would the \u201cbest\u201d time to buy the stock.\n\n10.

We expect the 2.5D demand will continue to increase in 2024, and we plan to support our customers in line with market growth. The consumer end-market declined 38% for the full year. Multiple headwinds including reduced consumer spending, excess inventory, and product changeovers in the IoT wearable market and drove the decline. Within consumer, we support a broad portfolio of solutions for IoT wearables, as well as the traditional consumer products. We are engaged in the next-generation products with our lead customers that will ramp production in the course of 2024.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, our manufacturing organization focused on optimizing capacity for 2.5D technology in Korea, and on qualifying advanced SiP and memory technology in Vietnam.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nJim Cramer called Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\u00a0a \u201cwinner\u201d in one of his latest programs like it was a no-brainer. Cramer said the reason why Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\u00a0does not receive a lot of attention is because it\u2019s a \u201cvery boring company.\u201d Cramer said this is an inexpensive stock and reiterated that he thinks the stock is a \u201cwinner.\u201d\n\nCommercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)\u00a0shares have gained about 5% in 2024 so far through March 5.\n\nDuring its latest earnings call the company talked about guidance:\n\n\"We expect shipment volumes within our North America Steel Group to decline sequentially due to normal seasonality during the winter months. Margins on steel products are likely to experience some further compression during the second quarter. However, recent price announcements on rebar, merchant bar, and wire rod should support an inflection point in the coming months. Downstream product margins should exhibit good stability sequentially. Conditions in Europe are expected to remain challenging, but adjusted EBITDA excluding energy rebates should improve from the levels of the past two quarters. Financial results for our Emerging Businesses Group are anticipated to follow a typical seasonal pattern with some slowing of activity in Q2.\n\nLooking beyond the second quarter, which is CMC\u2019s seasonally slowest period, we expect robust spring and summer construction activity driven by the increased impact of rising infrastructure investment, which should support an already healthy demand backdrop. Both the North America Steel Group and the Emerging Businesses Group should benefit from anticipated strong activity levels. Regarding the Europe Steel Group, supply-side adjustments and the impact of increasing levels of residential and infrastructure construction should drive sequential improvement in financial results beginning with the spring construction season.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\nIn addition to Commercial Metals, Jim Cramer is also bullish on \u00a0Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Lightning Round: 5 Stock Recommendations.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer\u2019s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Tech giant Nvidia has been one of the hottest stocks over the past couple of years, with its shares more than doubling since 2022. But technology isn't the only place where investors can find excellent investments.\n\nIn fact, three healthcare stocks that have outperformed Nvidia since 2022 are TransMedics Group (NASDAQ: TMDX), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), and Verona Pharma (NASDAQ: VRNA). Here's a look at how well these stocks have performed, why they have fared so well, and whether they're still good buys today.\n\n1. TransMedics Group: 369%\n\nTransMedics is a fairly small medical device company with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. The company has developed an organ care platform for which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval; it can transport multiple organs. It's the only multi-organ platform that regulators have approved. It can improve patient outcomes and be a game changer for the business.\n\nThe business has been making significant progress in growing its top line over the years, and TransMedics continues to generate impressive numbers. On Monday, the company reported its 2023 fourth-quarter results, and revenue totaling $81.2 million was up 159% year over year. TransMedics also posted a profit of $4 million. For 2024, TransMedics expects its full-year revenue to grow by around 50%, totaling between $360 million and $370 million.\n\nWith a lot more growth still on the horizon, it may not be too late to invest in the healthcare stock despite its already impressive gains.\n\n2. Eli Lilly: 183%\n\nEli Lilly has become the largest healthcare stock in the world after nearly tripling in value since 2022. The big reason for its recent success is tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Mounjaro, its diabetes drug, and Zepbound, its approved treatment for weight loss. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped people lose an astonishing 26.6% of their body weight when patients made significant lifestyle changes while also using the drug.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe hype surrounding anti-obesity treatments has been the catalyst behind its rally over the past couple of years, as Eli Lilly truly has a game changer on its hands. Analysts believe that tirzepatide could generate at least $68 billion in annual revenue at its peak. Just how high that number ends up will depend on what other indications it may get approved for. In clinical trials, tirzepatide has helped treat fatty liver disease, and similar drugs have been associated with helping to reduce the cardiovascular risk for obese people.\n\nThere could still be a lot more upside for Eli Lilly's stock simply due to the opportunity for tirzepatide. Although the stock looks expensive, trading at well over 100 times earnings, that doesn't mean it has peaked; Eli Lilly may very well be the first healthcare stock to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\n\n3. Verona Pharma: 156%\n\nPharmaceutical company Verona Pharma rounds out this list with gains of 156% since 2022. It's the riskiest stock on this list as it doesn't have an approved product just yet, but it's close to the finish line with ensifentrine. The FDA is currently reviewing the company's application for it in treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a PDUFA date has been set for June 26.\n\nThe $1.4 billion stock could have a lot more room to run if regulators give the drug the green light as it could be a blockbuster, with analysts projecting that at its peak, it could bring in $1.5 billion in annual revenue.\n\nWithout approval, however, Verona will continue to incur losses and burn through cash as it doesn't have an approved product to rely on for consistent revenue. But with ensifentrine showing encouraging results in clinical trials, there's hope that approval will happen this year.\n\nIf you're not OK with taking on some considerable risk, however, you may want to wait on the sidelines with Verona Pharma stock as it's by no means a sure thing; if regulators push back on the treatment and don't end up approving it, that could lead to a sharp sell-off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) Just Reported Full-Year Earnings And Analysts Are Lifting Their Estimates",
        "content": "A week ago, TransMedics Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMDX) came out with a strong set of full-year numbers that could potentially lead to a re-rate of the stock. Results overall were credible, with revenues arriving 5.8% better than analyst forecasts at US$242m. Higher revenues also resulted in lower statutory losses, which were US$0.77 per share, some 5.8% smaller than the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n\nSee our latest analysis for TransMedics Group  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nAfter the latest results, the five analysts covering TransMedics Group are now predicting revenues of US$366.4m in 2024. If met, this would reflect a huge 52% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Losses are predicted to fall substantially, shrinking 47% to US$0.41. Before this latest report, the consensus had been expecting revenues of US$330.2m and US$0.68 per share in losses. So there's been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates, with the analysts making a sizeable increase to their revenue forecasts while also reducing the estimated loss as the business grows towards breakeven.\n\nThe consensus price target rose 13% to US$101, with the analysts encouraged by the higher revenue and lower forecast losses for next year. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic TransMedics Group analyst has a price target of US$105 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$95.00. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of TransMedics Group'shistorical trends, as the 52% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 55% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 7.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that TransMedics Group is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year. Happily, they also upgraded their revenue estimates, and are forecasting them to grow faster than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on TransMedics Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

Hassanein\n\nThank you so much, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TransMedics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 earnings call. As always, joining me today is Stephen Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth fourth quarter performance represents a need a new high watermark for TransMedics business. We ended the year on a very strong note, laying a solid foundation for continued growth. Also, the fourth quarter was the first quarter that we had TransMedics transplant logistics services operational during the full three months of the quarter, although it is early, although TransMedics logistics is in its early innings. I am thrilled to report on the early successes of the logistical services we successfully executed on every front and overcame early operational challenges as we continue to expand our footprint and team.\r\n Let me share the summary of our results for Q4 and full year 2023. Total revenue for 4Q grew to 81.2 million, representing 159% growth from 4Q 2022 and 2020 and a 22% sequential growth from 3Q 2023. For the full year of 23, total revenue was $241.6 million, representing 159% growth over 2022. So for the second consecutive year we delivered on and even exceeded our aspirational aspirations to double revenue year over year.\r\n In the first years of OCS commercial launch, TransMedics logistics services revenue for 4Q was $9.2 million, up from 2.1 million in 3Q. We are proud of this success in the first full quarter of operations based on everything we know today we are growing extremely confident and bullish on the significant potential positive impact of TransMedics logistical services to help us grow the use of NOP. platform. We fully expect our integrated NOP and logistics services to enable TransMedics to deliver an end-to-end, seamless, efficient and safe solution to transplant programs across the U.S. simply stated, providing a world-class service through a highly cost efficient model. Our overall gross margin for 4Q was 59%, down from 66% in 4Q 2020 to the full year 2023. Our gross margin was 64% compared to 70% in 22. I know Steven is going to detail this in his section of today's presentation. However, I want to take this opportunity to give you my perspective on this important topic of TransMedics gross margin, please remember, we are still very early in our commercial ramp and more so with our logistics services there are several leverage points I repeat. There are several leverage points for both product and service revenues that are not fully reflected in our models yet based on everything we know today we are extremely confident that we will be able to ramp the gross margin up over the next 12 to 18 months as we achieve more leverage of scale in our operations in the meantime, we are thrilled that we achieved a 35% gross margin for our service business faster than we had projected, exceeding our early expectations. Again, it is just that beginning, we also achieved critical profitability milestone in 4Q as we delivered our first GAAP operating profit quarter. Specifically, we delivered 2.6 million of operating profit and 4 million of net profit in the fourth quarter. This marks a critical step forward as we strive to reach and sustain positive cash flow in the very near future.\r\n Before moving on, I'd like to take a moment to recognize that these exceptional results were only possible through the hard work of the entire TransMedics team. Let me send a message to team TransMedics. We are grateful for your world-class effort, commitment and creativity in navigating every operational challenge of our rapidly growing business in 2023.\r\n Importantly, I want to make it crystal clear that we are now gearing up for another strong year of execution in 2024.\r\n Now let me move on to provide my perspectives on some important trends and what do they mean for our business in line with our growth strategy, we grew our case volume across all three organ markets in 23 compared to 22. Our OCS Lung case volume grew by approximately 11%. Our OCS Heart case volume grew by approximately 82%, and our OCS Liver case volume grew by approximately 199%, almost tripling from 2020 to for the full year, we have transplanted approximately 2,300 OCS transplants in the U.S. compared to approximately 1,000 transplants in 22. We plan to report our annual OCSK. volume in the US going forward as a benchmark towards the stated goal of performing 10,000 transplants in the U.S. by 2028.\r\n In terms of NOP contribution, as we predicted, NOP represented the lion's share of OCS transplants in the U.S. We ended the year with an overall NOP rate of more than 98% across all three organs. We are confident that this sustained growth and success of NOP is based solely on the operational efficiency to grow transplant volumes, highest level of clinical care of donor organs and the overall cost efficiency experienced by transplant programs across the United States. Importantly, we are planning to present several data analyses during the upcoming transplant conferences in 2024 to unequivocally demonstrate the improved clinical outcomes achieved using OCSNOP. in the US. Again, I want to stress a key point. The success of OCSNOP. program is based on better clinical economic and operational outcomes experienced by the transplant centers and not based on anything else in Q4. We buttressed the NOP clinical staffing by adding 37 new clinical specialists and four procurement surgeons.\r\n Now let me share the impact of our OCS technology and NOP on the overall national transplant volume in the US for the first time in nearly eight plus years, both liver and heart transplant volumes grew by 12% nationally in the U.S. based on our OCS case number and donor mix, we are confident that our OCS technology and NOP services were primary drivers for this annual transplant volume growth. The overall national growth came from both increased use of DCD donors driven by OCS use as well as a modest increase in DBD. donor utilization. This is a great first step to prove the ability of the OCS and NOP to grow the overall U.S. transplant market. We are looking forward to continuing this trend in 24 and hopefully seeing similar growth in lung driven by OCS. and NOP. over the next few years.\r\n Now let's discuss the percent percentage penetration of the OCS use in each Oregon market segment nationally in the U.S., we ended 23 with the OCSK.'s volume representing approximately 17% share of the national liver transplant volume, approximately 16% share of the heart national transplant volume and approximately 4% share of the lung national transplant volume in the US. For anyone who may be assuming that TransMedics has maxed out on our growth potential, these data provided crystal clear evidence that we have a long way to go to continue to grow our market share in the US. This will be fueled further by our unique ability to also expand the overall national growth of transplant volumes in the US to help patients who are desperately in need for life-saving transplant procedure. Our vision is that by the time we reach that 10,000 U.S. OCS transplants that this number 10,000 would represent a portion of the overall U.S. transplant market and not the total addressable U.S. market.\r\n Now let me turn to a more detailed discussion on our transparent logistics service strategy and review its early performance in late 2023. I want to start by highlighting our strategy and value proposition. Please allow me to share some important facts and background on this important topic. One, historically for cold preservation and organ transport transplant center relied exclusively on charter flight brokers and local small operators a repeat transplant center relied on charter flight brokers and or local small charter operates. These brokers typically have used what they promote as an asset-light model, meaning they don't own or operate any aircrafts. Their role is simply to contract a charter flight and accrue from a local or regional operator when a donor mission is needed when TransMedics first deployed the NOP. program, you all remember, we too relied on the same network of Charter brokers. Unfortunately, we quickly learned through first-hand experience that the brokered charter flight model has significant limitations to help grow the transplant volume in the U.S. and was becoming a huge bottleneck for our NOP. program. This regional charter brokerage approach was very operationally inefficient and added significant costs to the transplant centers due to one fragmented, local and regional operators using older aircrafts that were not capable of covering the new longer-range donor missions now afforded by the new U.S. national Oregon allocation laws and the use of OCS technology. And it's an NOP.s capability to go longer distances to increase utilization of donor organs for transplant to significant shortage of charter planes availability for 24 seven to cover the growing demand for transplant missions. This resulted in the loss of approximately 20% to 30% of donor retrieval emissions for NOP. in 22 and early 23 three, the lack of control over the planes and pilots by most charter brokers often resulting in the use of more than one plane and multiple crews to complete a single mission, which sometimes doubled the transportation bill paid by the transplant center for lack of control over the starting location of the aircrafts led to use of highly inefficient routes, which added even more costs in order to reposition the aircraft five lack of control over air safety standards of these contracted charter outside of these contracted local or regional operators flying 2030 year old aircrafts. In fact, our own NOP. clinical and surgical teams experienced a few near catastrophic events on brokered aircrafts in 22 and 23, fix an inefficient route round trip cost model, even if the donor organ is not procured for transplant or if the DCD donor never progressed to become a donor.\r\n Finally, a very complex cost structure with multiple middlemen that paid with associated profit margins for the owner of aircraft, the operator of aircraft and the broker of the chartered flight. All these added significant and unnecessary cost burden to the transplant centers. So while this asset model might be light for the broker, it is clearly a very heavy financial burden to the transplant centers and payers who ended up paying multiple middleman. Importantly, it is also severely it also severely limits the ability to grow transplant volumes due to the two shortage of dedicated aircrafts. And we cite as a roadblock to our stated goal and commitment to growing the U.S. transplant volume to address these significant inefficiencies, safety issues and capacity constraints in the historical model above TransMedics created a new, more scalable model that needs the current and future needs for growth of the transplant markets in the US, while providing significant operational and cost efficiencies to the transplant centers.\r\n Let me share with you our vision and our goals that we've actually achieved to date. One, we set out to maximize donor organ utilization for transplants by building and operating a modern fleet of jets that can go longer distances. This fleet is dedicated to transplant missions and not charter flights using newer model aircraft allows us to use less fuel so we can be environmentally responsible, reduce maintenance costs and reduce downtime to maximize availability to conduct transplant missions.\r\n Two, our goal was to maximize operational efficiency, which will reduce cost on the transplant centers. Three, our goal is to maintain the highest level of air safety for our staff, our clinical users and the precious donor organs. We are caring for for maximize logistics availability to ensure that we reduce the waste of donor organs that do not get used due to lack of plain availability.\r\n And finally, leveraging the unique NOP network and proprietary modern dispatching algorithms with a digital command and control center structure to significantly reduce cost burden of DCD donors that don't progress to become a donor. The NOP. network infrastructure created by TransMedics has given us a unique ability to share our cost efficiencies with our transplant center users.\r\n Now with the above background, let me share with you some important early performance metrics for TransMedics transplant logistics service, which encompasses Aviation and Ground logistics for NOP. missions. As mentioned earlier, revenue from transplant logistics service alone was 9.2 million in 4Q compared to 2.1 million in 3Q, as we were only operational for approximately four to five weeks in 3Q. The average number of active TransMedics aviation planes were approximately seven planes in 4Q compared to approximately 3.5 in 3Q. We ended the year with a total of 11 owned aircrafts that will become fully operational in early 2024. Approximately 98 transplant programs in the U.S. use TransMedics logistics service in 4Q compared to approximately 36 programs in 3Q. This is an important metrics to unequivocally show that operational availability, cost efficiency and high safety standards enabled us to disrupt the inefficient historical truck model and take market share relatively quickly. We were able to cover only approximately 35% of our NOP. flights needs in 4Q using TransMedics aviation planes compared to 13% in 3Q at scale, we are hoping to cover 80% of the NOP. case cases using our TransMedics logistics service for both air and ground transport, we will use carefully selected highly reliable and safe operators for supplemental lifts to support our mission so far, we are humbled and proud by these early results. We are continuing to expand our air fleet and crew to operate aircraft we are hoping to have 15 to 20 aircraft operational by end of 24 or early 25. We opened the digital command and control I'm sorry, command and dispatch center and Andover at the end of December, and we are now fully operational 24 seven three 65 from this state of the art facility. This dispatch center is designed to maximize operational availability, efficiency and efficient routing of our NOP. resources to match to minimize plain repositioning costs on the transplant programs. Again, based on everything we know today, we are extremely confident and bullish on the potential positive impact of transplant logistics services on the growth of our NOPK.s volume and a more efficient utilization of our clinical resources.\r\n Before I leave the TransMedics logistics section, I want to share some perspective on a matter that recently entered the public domain. Many of you may be aware that a letter was e-mailed to TransMedics from a member of the U.S. Congress on February 21st, riding in his capacity as an individual member of Congress regarding TransMedics business practices prior to receiving this letter, we had never communicated with this Congressman, nor with any member of his staff. This letter contains serious accusations, which are grossly inaccurate unfounded. And based on wrong information, let me repeat again, this letter contains serious accusation, which are grossly inaccurate, unfounded and based on wrong information. Rest assured TransMedics has responded to this letter with the same level of seriousness with factual evidence to set the record straight. Our formal response is posted publicly on the Investors section of our website. It is clear that what TransMedics is doing in the area of transplant logistics is disrupting this antiquated charter brokerage model for organ transplantation. This is creating some competitive dynamic in this area by some of our historical by some of the historical brokers that are struggling to compare or to compete with our operationally efficient and cost effective logistical capabilities.\r\n Finally, let me give you a bird's eye view of our growth strategy in 2024 and hope to detail these initiatives in our one Q 2020 24 call in May, our goal in 24 is to continue to invest in building out our TransMedics transplant logistical services throughout 24. To give us more operational leverage and efficiencies, we will focus on growing our NOPK.s volume in all three market segments by driving both growth in the overall TransDigm volume and take share of existing volumes. We will initiate a new clinical program trial to reinvigorate the lung transplant activities in the United States.\r\n Finally, we are investing in our next-gen OCS technology platform that will be more optimized for NOP workflow and streamline the support process on our clinical staff to maintain the highest clinical management quality and achieve better product leverage. We are humbled by our success in 23. However, we are not standing still. We are laser focused on our execution plan for 24 to help drive growth in the overall transplant volumes in the US and for TransMedics business. That being said, we need to be balanced. We need to balance our bullish plans with potential scalability and competitive challenges. We are providing an annual revenue guidance between 360 million to 370 million, which represents 49% to 53% growth over 2023.\r\n With that, let me turn the call to Stephen Gordon to cover the detailed financial results for the quarter.\n\nThank you, Wally. I will now provide some additional detail on the Q4 results and other financial information for the quarter and the year.\r\n So starting with revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, our total revenue was 81.2 million. This is an increase of 159% from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the 22% sequential increase from last quarter to $81.2 million included $1.1 million related to our flight school and $1.4 million related to Summit Aviation's legacy business. So a total of 2.5 million that is non-transplant related. So 1.4 million of legacy business is not continuing and is expected to be zero in the first quarter of 2024. So that leaves $78.7 million of transplant related revenue worldwide in the U.S. transplant revenue was 75.2 million U.S. revenue also increased up over 100, 159% from the fourth quarter of 2022. And the US grew 26% sequentially from last quarter, and this included the 9.2 million of transplant TransMedics logistics revenue. The organ breakdown on U.S. revenue was 54 points, $54.7 million of liver 17.6 million of heart and 2.9 million of low organs growing substantially over Q4 of 2022. We did see a modest sequential decline in lung revenue while liver and heart continues strong. Sequential growth in Q4, ex U.S. revenue was $3.5 million, a 51% increase from Q4 of 2022, but also a sequential decline from Q3 of 2023. As we have stated in the past, our revenue outside the US may not be consistent due to the nature of transplant and the lack of reimbursement outside the United States. The OUS organ breakdown was 3.2 million of heart and 0.3 million of blood.\r\n Next, I will cover the product and service revenue. Our service revenue includes the added amounts we charge for the surgical procurement and organ management, and now also includes the amount we charge for organ procurement and transplant logistics, including air and ground services. In Q4, product revenue was $51.9 million and service revenue was 29.3 million. So the service portion was 36% of the total in Q4, and that includes that non-transplant Service revenue gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 59%. This was down from 66% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reflects the higher NOP. service component of our business, which was still in the early stage in Q4 of 2022, while drilling down one level, the product margin was 73% in Q4 and service margin was 35%. We did experience an unfavorable impact to product margin of about 300 basis points that will not repeat in Q1, which was related to end-of-year inventory cleanup and adjustments. We have made changes to our processes. So we will not see this type of quarterly anomaly in the future.\r\n On the service side, we are pleased that we were able to deliver 35% service gross margin in our first full quarter of providing our logistics service and IT just to repeat the service. So this achievement gives us confidence that we will be able to provide this service with the mid 30s, service gross margin or better as we grow our footprint and utilization of aviation. As a reminder, all costs related to aviation, including fuel pilots, maintenance and depreciation, are included in the service cost of goods sold.\r\n Total operating expenses for the quarter were $45.3 million, 65% above Q4 of 2022. Operating expense and this expense growth was driven by investment throughout the organization, including 87% growth in R & D related to investments in new products, development and O. NOP tools and 59% growth in SG&A for both NOP support and overall corporate infrastructure. The growth in operating expense of 65% while growing revenue by 159% allowed TransMedics to deliver its first GAAP operating profit of $2.6 million and net profit of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This compared with an operating loss of 6.8 million in Q4 of 22 and a net loss of $6.7 million in Q4 22. Total cash at the end of the year was $394.8 million as of December 31st, 2023, which equates to cash usage of $32.3 million from the balance at the end of Q3 of 2023 of our operating cash was a positive 8.3 million in the quarter of which was offset by the purchase of three additional planes in the quarter for about 39 million. Basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were $32.6 million, and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the quarter were 34.2 million.\r\n Now let me share some summarized information on the full fiscal year 2023 results for the full year, total revenue was $241.6 million, again, a 159% increase over the prior year. The U.S. organ breakdown for the full year was 151.5 million of liver, 59.4 million of heart and 10.5 million of loans ex U.S. was 14 million of heart, 1.3 million of lung and 0.1 million of liver. And again, non-transplant revenue for the year was $4.9 million. Product revenue for the year was $176.1 million and service revenue was $65.6 million. Gross margin for the full year 2023 was 64% compared to 20 as compared to 70% in 2022. Again, this is a result of the higher portion of NOP service revenue. Product margin was 77% and service margin was 29%. For the full year of 2023, total operating expenses were $182.5 million for the full year 2023, up 89%. I'm $96.7 million in 2022 and included $27.2 million of one-time acquired in process R & D related to our acquisition of technology from bridge to life and 2 million of acquisition-related expenses from our acquisition of Summit, both in the third quarter of 2023. Our operating loss for the year was $28.7 million or 23 compared to $31.4 million in 2022. And net loss was EUR25 million in 2023 compared to 36.2 million in 2022. Overall, 2023 was a tremendous year for TransMedics as we demonstrated the potential to grow our business while helping to increase the overall number of transplants by adding logistic services to our NOP offering, we can now provide a true turnkey solution to our transplant center customers. We continue to be extremely optimistic about our opportunity to continue to grow in 2024 and beyond.\r\n To repeat, while these earlier comment we are providing annual revenue guidance in the range of 360 million to 370 million, which represents 49% to 53% growth over the full year 2023. Also, for modeling purposes, we expect gross margins to improve throughout 2024, and we would expect to exit 2024 in the 63% to 64% range for overall gross margin. We do expect the product mix and service mix to be around 65% product and 35% service in 2024, we expense expect expenses to grow in 2024, likely in the 30% to 40% range.\r\n Now I would like to turn the call back to Waleed for closing comments.\n\nWaleed H. Hassanein\n\nThank you, Stephen. We're very humbled by and proud of TransMedics performance. In 2023, we more than double our overall revenue. We help grow the national U.S. heart and liver transplant volumes by double digit numbers. We launched a new TransMedics logistics network to drive more operational and cost efficiency for our clinical users. And we achieved our first GAAP operating profit quarter for the business. In totality, we set a solid foundation for sustained growth of our business and our mission of growing transplant volumes to help patients in need for an organ transplant. Now we are laser focused on our 2024 operational plans and on our path towards achieving 10,000 Alsius transplants by 2028.\r\n With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nOperator, we will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star and one on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the key. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Our first question comes from Alan gone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\r\n Hi, Dean.\n\nThanks for the question and congrats on a good quarter.\r\n I wanted to start off diving a little bit deeper into your guidance. You provided the gross margin outlook by disposables versus service. But I think a big question that we still have is when we think about your disposables versus service on the top line, how should we think about the drivers of the growth that you're expecting to see?\n\nYes, Alan, as far as drivers of growth. I mean, we continue to as well. Lead mentioned, we want to penetrate deeper across all three organs, and we want to deliver a clinical program in lung that will help increase the lung later in the year. And the impact of the logistics business is not just for the growth in logistics. It's also to grow the case volume, which we expect to happen.\n\nAnd Alan, thank you for the question from our perspective. I agree with Stephen, but let me give you a little bit more granular response. We're nowhere close to being done growing in transplant volume. We will grow our transplant volume by growing it by going deeper into existing accounts by adding more RDCD. and DBD. organs across all three organs by reinvigorating the lung program by adding new accounts in areas where we don't have enough accounts like the lung program as well as you know, adding more DBD. to our heart franchise. We are we are just in the beginning of this commercial ramp-up and the other impact is the indirect or direct impact of operational efficiency with TransMedics logistics, it may even drive more growth into the actual case volume and the overall revenue growth from the logistics aspect of our business. So it is it's a we monitor and drive both sides of our business. The disposable income product as well as the service and the synergies that exist between the two will also have an important catalyst two adoption of the disposals.\r\n Got it.\n\nAnd then just as a quick follow-up, we had seen the letter that you sent in response to the congressional letter. So I won't dive more into that, but there also was an article out I'm kind of talking about a more thorough investigation of OPOs as a, you know, a kind of a continuation of the investigation that's been ongoing over the last few years. How should we think about the potential for that to disrupt the underlying trends by end market? And how should we think about the longer-term impact on TransMedics.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. Alan. As you said, what was announced today in the Washington Post is just a continuation of what's been ongoing for several years for them. I'm trying to disrupt or revamp the OPO network in the US. The bottom line is is the following. Transmedics went out alone and developed a unique model for the NOP. We build it, we executed it and we delivered results to grow transplant volumes in this country by double digits numbers. That hasn't been seen until almost a decade. We are going to continue to do that and we are proud of what we've accomplished. We don't think what's happening with the OPOs or what what's been announced earlier today. Has anything to do with us, but we are here and we are proud to show anybody who cares to know how to grow transplant volumes in this country. We've already done it and we will continue to do it. And so again, it's unfortunate what's going on. But as you said, it's been going on for several years. And in the meantime, we are focusing on our business. We're focusing on driving more organ transplants in this country successfully with excellent results using our NOP. service and now our logistics service.\r\n Next question operator.\r\n Next question comes from Josh Jennings with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\r\n Good evening.\n\nThanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong finish to a remarkable year. Wanted to just ask about the congressman Slattery provided us a strong rebuttal, proving every every accusation allegations from well, if you think there could be any short-term disruption to the business of these headlines flying around at our sense is that you've added so many transplant program, just customers that are all aware of the business model don't seem to have any issues with it. But just wonder any any short-term disruption potential into any next steps that you expect from this inquiry, whether Congressman?\n\nThank you, Josh. Josh, the first part of your question on this and no one has always to assume some level of confusion.\r\n Okay? This letter came out of left field and it was not supported by any fact it was complete completely unfounded I am sure for members behind this is going to try to use that letter to tried to distract from TransMedics business, but what they're not counting on or what you guys should expect is TransMedics is not going to stand still. We are going to defend our practice our success, our goal to grow transplant volumes, our ability to support these transplant institutions to deliver the best clinical support for their organs and for their patients as we have been doing for the past 25 years. And we all you all know that TransMedics defend our positions very vigorously and and fairly so we're not going to be standing still. We're going to tried to minimize that disruption as much as we can do. We expect distraction?\r\n Absolutely, because now it's natural. As far as the next part of the question, I really don't know, Josh, and I don't I don't know. I don't know where this letter how this letter came about other than it appears that there are some misinformation being propagated, but our response is pretty strong and it was designed as such to make sure that if anybody wants to, I'll go down the same path that they need to know exactly the facts before they come and levy these accusations against TransMedics. And of course, we're doing that with a full coordination of our senior advisers and legal team in Washington D.C. But we don't know what that what the next steps are other than we have responded on time and in a comprehensive fashion. And we are we are propagating our positions too and all the right people around TransMedics and on in Congress as well.\n\nThanks for that. And just a follow-up. Just you mentioned will lead about the plan to present some data analyses, demonstrating improved clinical outcomes on U.S. transplants by using or transfer centers using the NOP and you'll see us within the NOP, any metrics you can you can share with us that we should be looking for? And then how impactful do you think these data analyses can be in terms of driving the increased demand and adoption trends for NOP and MCS. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nThank you.\r\n Thank you, Josh. I think are our key metrics are the ones we've been monitoring all the time. We're looking at both short and long term definitive outcomes. We're looking at grades of PGD. primary graft dysfunction, early allograft dysfunction we're looking at patient and graft survival, both at six and 12 months. So these are the metrics we are. These are the metrics that transplant programs are measured by and also we're looking at penetration and growth of the case volume within each and transplant program in each market. So these are the metrics will be at discussing at ISHLP. and ATC. and ILT.\r\n Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\r\n Great. Thanks. Good evening.\n\nThanks for taking my questions. A very strong quarter, it looks like, especially in the liver. And I'm just curious, I mean, by our math, it looks like the liver procedures were probably up about 20% sequentially. And almost triple year over year. I was just kind of if you could help us understand what is kind of the really driving the liver adoption because it seems to be going much faster than the heart, which looks like it was up sequentially, but just not at the scale and pace at which liver is.\n\nThank you.\r\n Bill, I think I think there's you know, several reasons and frankly, several expected reasons for that. We all know that liver transplant procedures are nearly double or even 2.5 times the heart transplant procedures and so that's number one.\r\n Number two, liver transplantation is a dedicated service at transplant programs versus heart transplant is always adjunct to regular open-heart surgery and cardiothoracic surgery in general. And so that's number two. I think we are confident that the heart will pick up. Liver will always lead the way just because of the sheer number of procedures. I think over the next two or three years. The heart will get up there as we continue to demonstrate growth in the overall transplant volume and we will get the number of procedure up. We will see the long-term effect of OCS as we will start and reporting that at the next I-6 will peak. And we are extremely confident that a heart will pick up the pace. And more importantly, we're going to go out on a limb and say that over the next couple of years, we should see the lung. It's starting to really become more contributing to our overall growth. Again, not at the same level of liver because of the sheer number of procedures. But that's our goal is to get all three organs to be contributing close to each other.\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nAnd then my second question, if I could, is just aviation ramp has gone a lot faster than we expected from your 13 planes now if you said you get to 16 to 20, how do we? And I think you gave us the metric of 80%. When do you expect to hit the 80% and then how should we think about average revenue per case for aviation? Is you got a little more information you're getting deeper into this? And then how do we think about that service gross margin longer term? Because I think originally you thought would be 30%, you're already surpassing 35 and thanks for taking my questions.\n\nThank you, Bill. As always, the last questions, the first, the first aspect, we we hope to be fully operational at the scale of doing 75, 80% of our transmissions with our own fleet. When we surpass 20 operating TransMedics flights. We are aircrafts, which means we're talking sometime second half of 2025. So that's number one.\r\n And the second part of the question was remind me again, Bill, please or that the price for the average price permission, I we can't comment on that until we are completely dispersed equally across the the two sides of the United States, the east and west because the mix is different and that will happen hopefully as we exit 2024.\r\n And then finally, as far as the margin is concerned, I think you know, it's early. I think we are going to be in the 30s and I will leave it at that for now. And then we will we'll see how we are executing going forward.\n\nYes, that's great, though.\n\nI would just add, you know, as I mentioned, we do expect modest improvement over the over the year as we really what's important as we ramp the number of hours on the planes that we have and cover more of the fixed cost of aviation fund.\n\nGreat, thanks.\r\n Next question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead.\r\n Your guys.\n\nCongrats on the strong quarter and year and thanks for the questions. Steven, maybe wanted to start with on the margin front. It's more revenue related. Actually, this quarter, it looks like about 34.5% of your sales came from the logistics, and that's with you only covering about 35% of your NOP. cases with your own logistics solutions. So why would that percentage that 65, 35 stay the same as it ramps towards 80%, given that you're only at 35% today, just trying to square that up?\n\nYes.\n\nI think it's important, though, that that mix today that's not just logistics. That's all of the NOP service. So we only had 9 million of logistics service, which is a smaller percent of the total. And so as we grow this business, a couple of things are different. One is part of the service revenue this quarter was some some overhang from non transplant related revenue that's going to go away in Q2 in Q1. So that's a little bit coming out of the service. The other thing is we expect international to kind of come back to where it was last quarter. And so that is higher product revenue. So both of those are kind of skewing the service product mix in the wrong direction, I would say in Q4 or if it will change a bit in Q1 and then it remains to be seen how we pass is with how we go through the rest of the algorithm go through the rest of the year. But generally speaking, I think service portion is going to be in the mid to kind of maybe slightly upper 30% range. I don't think it ever gets to like 40% of our business.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat's very helpful color. And then maybe a broader strategic question. Obviously, with the growth in dynamic opportunity here a ton on your plate, but you you've also got bridges to life technology acquisitions, new product development, you're really building out the logistics business, hiring a lot of clinicians to support your growth targets. I'm curious if you could perhaps outline maybe two or three of the largest strategic initiatives that we should be keeping an eye on in 2024, not to set the platform as much for this year, but really to set that platform getting to the 10,000 cases banks?\n\nBrian, thank you for the question, and we're planning to detail all these in our next earnings call. But very important, we are doing all of the above, and we are looking forward to sharing more specific and granular details about our goals in 24 and beyond in our next earnings call.\n\nI look forward to that.\n\nThank you.\r\n Next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nSuraj Kalia\n\nPlease go ahead, please.\r\n Can you hear me?\r\n All right. We can hear you just fine size.\n\nPerfect, gentlemen. Congrats on an excellent quarter. So really two questions. First, our math, as you exited Q4 with liver heart and lung market shares of approximately 25, 20% and 4%, you guys do not put out guidance lightly, especially given your performance in the last two years and how The Street starts building things in and rough math is telling us based on the FY 24 guide, you're looking to get somewhere close to 25% to 30% share in Harbin livers and 10% to 15% lungs. And of the approximately right in our math and can you give us some additional granularity? How are you thinking through DBDD. city or site movement? I guess just strip down the the three 63 70 million guide a little more for us, if you could.\n\nYes, Suraj, this is Steven. So I don't think we can give you where we expect share to be. We definitely expect share to improve from where we are today. As we said, we we looked at it on an annual basis and we were kind of back 16% to 70% 17% share in in the heart and liver, and we certainly expect to improve that as we go into 2024.\n\nAnd your next part of your question, Suraj, remind me just in terms of any additional color, how you're thinking about DBE. versus DCD. and also the bell curve distribution. I guess just trying to understand, is that how you're targeting or getting getting to the numbers?\n\nYes, Suraj, let me let me let me address that one and thank you for the question. I think, Suraj, the way we approach. This is very it's very broad. I mean, we look at our case distribution and here's what we expect. We expect if we are heavily used in DCD., we expect that to continue, and we expect to continue to drive that forward across all three organs. But we're not going to stop here. We are going to find ways to invigorate DBD utilization. And we do that through a variety of different programs and mechanisms to drive adoption in that area to drive overall national transplant volume. And so at number three, we look at areas that are quiet or relatively quiet or lower up lower penetration like the lung and we find ways to reinvigorate the lung and it doesn't matter at that point whether it's DVD or DCD., can you imagine if we are, you know, more than where we are in the lung and near heart, at least? And what would that do to our revenue mix and penetration overall would be great. And after that, you know, as far as the transplant programs is concerned, you know, again, our service is and Universal Our service has been proven and two results in every promise that we set to achieve or every hypothesis or value that we set to achieve. And now it's up to TransDigm programs to decide whether or not they want to be, as you know, thriving and growing in the future of being a leading transplant program. And that is the way every transplant program should look at OCS. and NOP. and transmits logistics. And this is the future. And we know that we've proven it and we are standing by our commitment to transforming the field. And we welcome and expect many of the TransDigm programs. We'll be contributing part of our growth going forward because we are contributing to their growth. So and if I could not, it's not it's not a one-size fits all. We have to be dynamic. We have to be flexible. We have to tackle it in a broad range across all the organs across the two different types of donors and be creative on how we pulled the levers to achieve our goals. And again, we are very early given the penetration rates we discussed FairPoint's will lead.\n\nIf I could quickly ask a follow-up. Very nice sequential jump in the number of sites using TransMedics aviation. Similarly, as it normally happens, right, even at our site visit. One of the comments you had made was like we want to make it like a one-stop shop attach, TransMedics aviation to everyone. So you go to site is the 98 sites you talked about in Q4. What has been the reception? And I'm trying to understand is that like you all went to, I don't know, pick a number 200 sites, 98 are in board. The remaining one or two are resisting for whatever reason just set the stage for us to slice and dice how aggressive TransMedics is or lack thereof.\r\n Gentlemen, you guys are on a role. Congrats again. Thank you for taking my questions.\n\nThank you, sir.\r\n Thank you very much, Suresh. Unfortunately, I might disappoint you by saying I cannot give you more granular detail other than to remind you that there are not 250 programs out there that we would go to and again, our approach to these programs is very, very simple. When we get coal for an NOP. case, we provide them the option to use our transmix logistics. We provide them a price quote, and it's up to them to decide and whether they want to use us or not some centers like using us to came back and ask Tamara and Andr\u00e9 for a long-term contract. Some centers are we don't require that, but some center wanted to do that and we are there to help them achieve that goal.\r\n The bottom line for us is we know and we are confident that we are providing an operationally scalable and the most efficient cost structure in transplant logistics in the United States. And it's going to get better from here as we have more leverage and more plane and more capacity to meet many of these cases. And it's up to the transplant program out to them participate in this is cost effective or efficient model or not?\r\n I hope I addressed the question and I'm sorry, I can't give you more granular detail than that at this early stage of launching logistics only one quarter. So it's only one quarter, Suraj, so fair enough. Thank you.\r\n Conference back over to Waleed Hoffmann for any closing remarks.\r\n Thank you, operator. Thank you all very much for being with us this evening, and we look forward to speaking again in May. Have a wonderful evening.\r\n The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending.\r\n Today's presentation.\n\nYou may now.\r\n Yes.",

        "content": "Q4 Revenue: Reached $81.2 million, marking a 159% increase year-over-year. Full Year Revenue: Grew to $241.6 million, also up by 159% from the previous year. Net Income: Achieved $4.0 million in Q4, a significant improvement from a net loss of $6.7 million in Q4 of the prior year. Gross Margin: Reported at 59% in Q4, slightly down from 66% in the same quarter last year. Operating Expenses: Increased to $45.3 million in Q4, driven by investments to support company growth. 2024 Outlook: Anticipates revenue between $360 million to $370 million, representing 49% to 53% growth. Cash Position: Strong with $394.8 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with TMDX.\n\nOn February 26, 2024, TransMedics Group Inc (NASDAQ:TMDX), a pioneering medical technology company, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its innovative Organ Care System (OCS), released its 8-K filing, revealing a significant increase in revenue and a positive net income for the quarter.\n\nTransMedics Group Inc is revolutionizing organ transplant therapy for patients with end-stage organ failure. Its OCS technology is a portable organ perfusion, optimization, and monitoring system that maintains near-physiologic conditions for donor organs outside the human body. TransMedics Group Inc (TMDX) Reports Stellar Revenue Growth in Q4 and Full Year 2023\n\nFinancial Performance and Challenges\n\nThe company's revenue for Q4 2023 was a record $81.2 million, a 159% increase from $31.4 million in the same period last year. This growth was primarily attributed to the increased utilization of the OCS through the National OCS Program (NOP) and additional revenue from TransMedics' transplant logistics services. For the full year, revenue also saw a 159% increase to $241.6 million. These numbers are crucial as they demonstrate the company's ability to scale its operations and the growing acceptance of its OCS technology in the medical community.\n\nDespite the impressive revenue growth, TransMedics faced a decrease in gross margin, which was reported at 59% for Q4 2023, down from 66% in Q4 2022. This decline may signal cost pressures or changes in the company's product mix, which could potentially impact profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nOperating expenses also saw a rise to $45.3 million in Q4 2023, up from $27.5 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This increase reflects the company's strategic investments to support its growth trajectory. However, it's important to monitor whether these investments will translate into sustainable long-term growth.\n\nFinancial Achievements and Importance\n\nTransMedics' financial achievements, particularly the turnaround to a net income of $4.0 million in Q4 from a net loss of $6.7 million in the same quarter of the previous year, underscore the company's improving operational efficiency and market penetration. For a company in the Medical Devices & Instruments industry, such profitability is a positive indicator of the company's potential to leverage its innovative technology for commercial success.\n\nKey Financial Metrics and Commentary\n\nKey financial metrics from the income statement show a robust performance, with net product revenue at $51.9 million and service revenue at $29.3 million for Q4. The balance sheet reflects a strong cash position of $394.8 million, which is vital for the company's future R&D and operational expansion. Dr. Waleed Hassanein, President and CEO, commented on the company's performance:\n\n2023 was a great year for TransMedics as we achieved 159% revenue growth and launched TransMedics transplant logistics services to provide a more operationally and economically efficient service to our transplant program users.\n\nLooking ahead, TransMedics expects total revenue for the full year of 2024 to be in the range of $360 million to $370 million, indicating continued growth momentum.\n\nAnalysis and Prospects\n\nTransMedics Group Inc's performance in 2023 reflects a company on the rise, with significant revenue growth and a positive shift towards profitability. The company's focus on expanding its OCS technology and logistics services has paid off, leading to a substantial increase in national heart and liver transplant volumes. With a strong cash reserve and a positive outlook for 2024, TransMedics is well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory and further cement its place as a leader in the medical technology space.\n\nInvestors and stakeholders will be watching closely to see if the company can maintain its growth rate, manage operating expenses, and continue to innovate in the organ transplant market. The full financial results and additional details can be accessed on the TransMedics website, and interested parties are encouraged to join the upcoming conference call to discuss these results further.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from TransMedics Group Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

This double-digit growth in transplant volumes has not been witnessed in several years.\"\n\nFourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results\r\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $81.2\u00a0million, a 159% increase compared to $31.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was due primarily to the increase in utilization of the OCS through the National OCS Program\u00a0(\"NOP\") as well as additional revenue generated by the addition of TransMedics logistics services.\n\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 59% compared to 66% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $45.3 million compared to $27.5\u00a0million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in operating expense was driven primarily by increased investment throughout the organization to support the growth of the company. Fourth quarter operating expenses in 2023 included $5.5 million of stock compensation expense compared to $3.0 million of stock compensation in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.0\u00a0million compared to net loss of $6.7\u00a0million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFull Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue for the full year of 2023 was $241.6\u00a0million, a 159% increase compared to $93.5 million in the full year of 2022.

Full year 2023 operating expenses included $19.4 million of stock compensation expense compared to $10.3\u00a0million in 2022.\n\nNet loss for the full year of 2023 was $25.0\u00a0million compared to $36.2\u00a0million in the full year of 2022.\n\nCash was $394.8\u00a0million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n2024 Financial Outlook TransMedics expects total revenue for full-year 2024 to be in the range of $360\u00a0million to $370 million, which represents 49% to 53% growth compared to the company's prior year revenue.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Details The TransMedics management team will host a conference call beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT on Monday, February 26, 2024.

The Nasdaq Composite Index, which contains mostly growth stocks, shot 43% higher in 2023 after collapsing 33% in 2022.\n\nThe latest big run-up for growth stocks probably should make investors nervous about another crash on the horizon. That said, history says growth stocks could keep climbing throughout 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIn uncertain times like these, making modest but frequent additions to your portfolio is a smart strategy that anyone can follow, now that discount brokerages no longer charge steep fees for every transaction.\n\nA dollar-cost averaging strategy won't lead to the best possible prices for the stocks in your portfolio, but it also ensures that you don't suffer heavy losses by betting all chips just ahead of a market crash. With share prices currently below $100, adding some shares of the stocks below to an already diverse portfolio could be a smart move.\n\nPalantir\n\nPalantir(NYSE: PLTR) is an artificial intelligence (AI) company that helps organizations analyze data from multiple sources that typically don't communicate. For example, the U.S. government uses Palantir's platform to thwart potential terrorist attacks by cross-referencing FBI databases with public transportation records.\n\nPalantir cut its teeth on lucrative government contracts, but the growth of its private-sector business is accelerating. In the U.S., its commercial customer revenue increased 70% year over year in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe ongoing rollout of Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform is driving growth in the U.S. market. and it's probably only a matter of time before the rest of the world catches on. Total revenue grew 17% last year, and growth is accelerating. Total sales during the three months that ended last December were 5% higher than the previous quarter, driven largely by commercial customers signing up for Palantir's AI platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2024, Palantir expects between $800 million and $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. At the moment, though, the company's market cap is north of $54 billion. A valuation of more than 50 times adjusted free cash flow expectations is sky-high, but enterprises are hurling money at Palantir to avoid falling behind the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nWith no end to surging demand for AI services in sight, this stock could grow into its high valuation and deliver market-beating gains over the long run. That said, the stock could fall hard from its inflated valuation if earnings don't continue shooting higher.\n\nTransMedics Group\n\nIf you're tired of hearing about AI but you still want to invest in businesses with enormous growth potential, consider TransMedics Group(NASDAQ: TMDX). This company is singlehandedly improving the way donated organs are maintained before they're surgically implanted in a new body.\n\nTransMedics Group has an Organ Care System (OCS) that pumps organs full of warm blood. This is a huge improvement over the old standard, which was mostly limited to styrofoam coolers full of ice.\n\nThe TransMedics OCS allows preserved organs to travel much farther than usual to reach a matched transplant recipient. Unfortunately, there aren't enough charter flight providers to keep up with the company's increasing needs, so it acquired its own aviation company last summer.\n\nInvestors were more than a little disturbed when the medical device company suddenly became a private airline; the stock is still below its previous peak.\n\nTransMedics Group doesn't have profits to measure its valuation against yet, but they could be right around the corner. The company lost $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 due to $29.2 million in nonrecurring transaction costs.\n\nTransMedics expects to report total 2023 revenue in a range between $222 million and $230 million when it releases fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26, after the market closes. The stock has been trading for about 12.6 times the top end of management's sales expectation for last year.\n\nWhile 12.6 times trailing sales is a high multiple to pay for a growth stock, it's not at all unreasonable for a company growing at TransMedics Group's pace. Management's 2023 revenue outlook predicted a gain of between 138% and 142% last year.\n\nWarm perfusion of donated organs isn't new, but the TransMedics OCS is the only system approved by the Food and Drug Administration to preserve and transport hearts, lungs, and livers. This means any potential competitors have a lot of hoops to jump through before transplant facilities consider them a preferred option.\n\nThis stock's valuation is high. But given an approved system for maintaining organs, and a fleet of jets to transport them, you can reasonably expect enough growth from TransMedics Group to make its present valuation seem like a bargain five years from now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Exit Now! 3 Small-Cap Stocks to Sell in February 2024",
        "content": "There are some small-cap stocks to sell this month. These companies offer too much risk for too little upside, meaning that they do not fill worthy positions in investors\u2019 portfolios. These small-cap stocks to sell in this article were selected due to their declining fundamentals and bleak outlooks, both for the short term and beyond.\n\nTherefore, to safeguard your investment portfolio against potential losses, it is advisable to take action today by removing these high-risk small-cap stocks. Doing so can help investors maintain a balanced and healthy portfolio, one that is better suited to withstand market volatility and deliver consistent returns over time.\n\nSo, here are three small-cap stocks to consider dropping from your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLakeland Industries (LAKE) A photo of someone looking at clothing on hangers, hanging from a rack.\n\nSource: Rawpixel.com/ShutterStock.com\n\nLakeland Industries (NASDAQ:LAKE) is a manufacturer and seller of industrial protective clothing and accessories.\n\nDespite posting a strong previous quarter, I feel that the headwinds facing LAKE are too strong, and thus, it\u2019s one of those small-cap stocks to sell.\n\nProblems facing the company include currency fluctuations negatively impacting operating profit and ongoing economic headwinds in key markets like China. Furthermore, the company\u2019s reliance on strategic acquisitions for growth, as indicated by its plans to expand through mergers and acquisitions until 2027, gives it substantial financial and execution risks.\n\nI also feel that LAKE stock\u2019s valuation has stretched too far for its fundamentals to handle. Its stock price has surged 11.79% over the past year, and it trades at 20 times earnings for just $122.45 million in revenue over the past 12 months.\n\nLAKE, therefore, seems poised for a correction, and it might be wise for current investors to sell a portion of their position to take a profit or exit entirely.\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) stethoscope on a stock chart representing healthcare stocks to buy. Healthcare Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) claims to be on the brink of profitability, with projections of triple-digit EPS growth over the next few years. The company\u2019s net income margins are expected to improve from negative 5% in 2023 to positive 8% in 2026, reaching potentially 20% by the end of the decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Wall Street is less optimistic, as it expects the company\u2019s EPS to remain negative beyond FY2026, according to projections.\n\nHolding a stock for this long is risky, and there are also fears that it will need to take on additional debt or make an equity raise that could further burden investors. The company has $427.61 million in cash and $515.65 million in debt. It also had around $112 million in capital expenditures over the past 12 months.\n\nIf TMDX continues with its rate of cash burn, it will need to weaken its balance sheet or issue shares further, diluting current investors.\n\nI think it might be a wise move for investors to consider selling their holdings in this company and buy back once there\u2019s more certainty that it\u2019s able to generate a single dollar of profit without diluting shareholders.\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) a couple has breakfast at a campsite\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) has been a topic of discussion among investors and analysts, especially with its performance in 2023 and outlook for 2024.\n\nIn 2023, ASO reported a quarterly earnings miss with an EPS of $1.38 against a consensus estimate of $1.58. The revenue for the same quarter was $1.40 billion, down from the expected $1.44 billion, indicating a year-over-year revenue decline of 6.4%\u200b\n\nAnother problem for ASO is that it the company has $274.83 million in cash and $1.80 billion in debt. This gives a negative cash position of -$20.56 per share, which I think underscores its financial risk.\n\nFurthermore, its quick ratio of 0.25 means that for every dollar of current liabilities, the company only has 25 cents in liquid assets available to pay them.\n\nASO\u2019s declining free cash flow year-over-year is also particularly concerning, dropping from 970 million in 2020 to 443 million in 2022.\n\nThese factors and more make me believe that ASO is one of those small-cap stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Exploding interest in artificial intelligence (AI), driven by the launch of ChatGPT, has investors of all stripes rushing out to buy shares of tech companies with AI-related businesses. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite index shot 43% higher, thanks largely to the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which did most of the heavy lifting.\n\nThe abbreviation \"AI\" means different things to different people, so picking stocks that will ride this undefined trend can be guesswork at best. As a result, individuals and institutions keep hurling cash at the Magnificent Seven while ignoring terrific growth stocks like the two below. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThere's nothing necessarily wrong with the Magnificent Seven stocks. But all the extra attention they're getting is driving up valuations, which makes it harder for new investors to realize satisfying gains.\n\nThese growth stocks aren't in the Magnificent Seven, and they have very little to do with generative AI or large language models. As a result, they're flying under the radar -- and look like great stocks to buy right now.\n\nTransMedics Group\n\nTransMedics Group(NASDAQ: TMDX) is singlehandedly improving America's solid-organ donation process. Its proprietary Organ Care System (OCS) is the only one approved by the Food and Drug Administration to preserve donated hearts, lungs, and livers after their removal, by pumping them full of warm blood.\n\nTransMedics Group's OCS is a major improvement over the old standard: styrofoam coolers packed with ice. Perhaps the most remarkable improvement is the ability to safely transplant hearts donated after circulatory death (DCD). Without help from TransMedics, DCD hearts are almost never transplanted into waiting patients.\n\nTransMedics' OCS also lengthens the time donated organs remain viable, which increases the distance they can travel to a transplant center. The company found itself hindered by a lack of charter flights, so it acquired an aviation business last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the only company that owns an FDA-approved OCS and a fleet of jets to transport organs, TransMedics will most likely corner the organ transplantation market for years to come. Despite this advantage, there are risks associated with this richly valued stock that investors should understand before adding shares to their portfolios.\n\nTransMedics isn't generating recurring profits yet, but it's close. In the third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $25.4 million due to $29.2 million in nonrecurring acquisition expenses.\n\nLately, TransMedics stock has been trading at a price of about 15 times trailing sales. This is a high valuation, but it's relatively low for this stock. If investors don't see the company report significant profits in 2024, the price could fall even further.\n\nInMode\n\nMedical technology company InMode(NASDAQ: INMD) markets a range of devices that dermatologists and plastic surgeons can build a practice around. Its proprietary radiofrequency technology is central to several devices and treatments. These include BodyTite, an increasingly popular procedure that melts and removes fat like liposuction, but without surgery.\n\nThe stock price is under pressure for a couple of reasons. First, the company overpromised in early 2023 and had to issue downward revisions to its forward outlook. Also weighing on InMode's stock is the location of its headquarters: Yokneam Illit, Israel. Management doesn't anticipate war-related interruptions to production, but it looks like the market has priced in significant disruption.\n\nDespite its downward guidance revision, InMode still expects to say that revenue rose about 8% last year when it reports results on Tuesday, Feb. 13. On the bottom line, management expects to report adjusted earnings that grew about 5% year over year. INMD Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIn five short years, InMode has grown trailing-12-month revenue by 354%, and earnings have bounded 433% higher. Even if you assume InMode will only grow its bottom line by 5% annually from now on, its present valuation of about 10.5 times trailing earnings looks like a bargain.\n\nWith proprietary devices, the company could return to the rapid growth rates we've seen over the past several years. If this happens, investors who bought the stock at today's beaten-down valuation could come out miles ahead over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in TransMedics Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in TransMedics Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and TransMedics Group wasn\u2019t one of them.
