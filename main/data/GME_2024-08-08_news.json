        "content": "Golden Entertainment (GDEN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.40 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -27.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this gaming services provider would post earnings of $0.13 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.37, delivering a surprise of -384.62%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.\n\nGolden Entertainment , which belongs to the Zacks Gaming industry, posted revenues of $167.33 million for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $286.68 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGolden Entertainment shares have lost about 30.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Golden Entertainment?\n\nWhile Golden Entertainment has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Golden Entertainment: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.30 on $175.25 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.24 on $703 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Gaming is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nGameStop (GME), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024.\n\nThis video game retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +66.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nGameStop's revenues are expected to be $900 million, down 22.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 2.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 3.43%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the video game retailer had lost 12.86% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 2.92% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.92% in that time.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of GameStop in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.01, up 66.67% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $900 million, reflecting a 22.67% fall from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $0.08 per share and revenue of $4.13 billion, indicating changes of +33.33% and -21.64%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for GameStop. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. GameStop currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, GameStop is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 263.38. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 18.13, so one might conclude that GameStop is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nThe Gaming industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, finds itself in the top 33% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Meme Stock Mania Returns: Should You Dive In or Stay with Dividend Stocks?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMeme stocks are gaining momentum again, bringing back the social media trend that gained traction in 2021. While the social media frenzy has died down over the past three years, influential financial investor Keith Gill, going by the pseudonym Roaring Gill, has again brought the limelight to these speculative stocks.\n\nGill made a fortune by buying meme stocks in 2021 and was one of the pioneers behind the original meme stock rally three years ago. In fact, GameStop's legendary ascent in early 2021, driven by a short squeeze, turned Gill into an online hero.\n\nThe retired insurance analyst quit his job at MassMutual at the height of the meme stock rally, indicating significant profits he had reaped.\n\nTrending: When today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out. This is a paid advertisement. Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Innovation Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\n\nGill has managed to bring back the meme stock trend once again. A few months ago, he posted a picture on the social media platform X, driving GameStop Corporation's (NYSE:GME) shares up by over 75% in one day. Today, his endorsement still holds immense sway among retail investors. So far this year, GME shares have popped by over 23%.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), another popular meme stock, has risen by over 55% over the past three months, signaling renewed interest in meme stocks among retail investors.\n\nDwindling Prospects\n\nThe hype around meme stocks has a worrying familiarity. While millions of retail investors pocketed significant profits during the meme stock rally of 2021, many who couldn't comprehend the risks involved or keep up with the instantaneous changes in market trends incurred substantial losses.\n\nAs the intrinsic value of popular meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment is the same, experts think it is only a matter of time before the current hype dies down. Meme stocks have been notoriously volatile historically \u2013 prices can plummet just as quickly as they rise. Companies with shaky finances or no clear growth plan are particularly vulnerable to sudden downturns once the social media enthusiasm tamps down.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nFind out how you compare to the average American couple\u2019s retirement balance \u2014 will you make the $1,000,000 mark? Real estate is a wealth builder for the nation\u2019s 1%. You can join top developers and invest like an insider.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend Stocks: The Safe Bet\n\nWhile the new age of finance and cheap zero-commission platforms like Robinhood has made it easy for investors to give in to the market hype without assessing the inherent risk factors, broader market indexes, on the other hand, have delivered stable returns throughout. While meme stocks were mostly in the red in the last two years, the S&P 500 index has risen by over 44% over the past two years.\n\nAltria\n\nAltria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO), one of the largest tobacco companies in the U.S., is a stalwart in the consumer staples sector. Altria currently pays $3.92 in dividends annually, yielding 7.84% on the current price, making it one of the highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500.\n\nThe company is in the coveted Dividend Kings list, having raised its dividend payouts for 54 consecutive years as of 2023. In fact, Altria has raised dividends 58 times over the last 54 years.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, is popular among investors as a dependable income stock. While the company cut its dividend payouts by nearly 50% in 2022, it still pays $1.11 in dividends annually yielding 5.7% on the current price. AT&T's four-year average dividend yield stands at 7.16%.\n\nOver the past few years, the telecom powerhouse has focused on strengthening its core telecom business and expanding its 5G infrastructure. The divestiture of WarnerMedia and the merger with Discovery Inc. have streamlined AT&T's operations, allowing the company to concentrate on its strengths in connectivity and communication services.\n\nLooking for Higher Returns? Try Investing in Private Real Estate\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "content": "(Bloomberg Law) -- The company that used to be known as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. sued Ryan Cohen and his company, RC Ventures LLC, to recover $47 million they made from alleged insider trading in 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice Valencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals Uber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts What a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do A Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\n\nCohen founded the pet food company Chewy Inc. and is the chairman and chief executive officer of the video game company, GameStop Corp.\n\nBetween January and August 2022, while the defendants \u201cwere acting as BBBY\u2019s statutory directors,\u201d they used insider information to trade BBBY stock, according to the complaint filed Thursday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe former Bed Bath says it\u2019s entitled to recover Cohen\u2019s and RC Ventures\u2019 alleged short-swing profits. Cohen and the fund \u201cmade dozens of purchases and sales of BBBY\u2019s equity securities between January and August 2022, all of them profitable and most within a single period of less than six months,\u201d the bankrupt entity says. The profit from those trades is recoverable under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act both because Cohen and the fund are statutory directors\u2014acting through deputized members of the board\u2014and because they beneficially owned more than 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s common stock, it says.\n\nThose appointees on the board \u201cprevailed in securing the Cohen Defendants significant access to material nonpublic information about BBBY,\u201d the former retailer says.\n\nThe suit is among efforts by the company and its bankruptcy plan administrator to recover funds for its creditors. The administrator, Michael Goldberg, sued a New Jersey agency to recover $19 million worth of tax credits that he claims are owed under economic development contracts. That case is pending in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\nThe company is also attempting to recover more than $300 million in trading profits from Hudson Bay Capital Management, a hedge fund involved in a last-ditch financing plan that didn\u2019t prevent the retailer\u2019s collapse, in a suit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The former retailer also filed this suit under the short-swing profit rule.\n\nRC Ventures is the largest holder of GameStop Corp. shares with an 8.7% stake in the company as of June 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company, 20230930-DK-BUTTERFLY-1 Inc., which did business as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., seeks money damages on its short-swing trading claim, as well as costs and fees.\n\nCohen and RC Ventures didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment emailed to GameStop Friday.\n\nJames A.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why GameStop Corp. (GME) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "GameStop (GME) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this video game retailer have returned -10.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Gaming industry, to which GameStop belongs, has lost 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, GameStop is expected to post a loss of $0.01 per share, indicating a change of +66.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.08 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +33.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.02 indicates a change of -75% from what GameStop is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GameStop is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor GameStop, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $900 million indicates a year-over-year change of -22.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $4.13 billion and $3.7 billion estimates indicate -21.6% and -10.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $881.8 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.7%. EPS of -$0.12 for the same period compares with -$0.14 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $900 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.02%. The EPS surprise was -20%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, GameStop surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGameStop is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GameStop. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with GameStop (GME) standing at $23.67, reflecting a -1.91% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.08%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.12%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.07%.\n\nThe video game retailer's stock has dropped by 2.27% in the past month, falling short of the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 1.74% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.21%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of GameStop in its upcoming release. The company is expected to report EPS of -$0.01, up 66.67% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $900 million, indicating a 22.67% decline compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $0.08 per share and revenue of $4.13 billion. These totals would mark changes of +33.33% and -21.64%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for GameStop. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. GameStop currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, GameStop is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 301.63. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 18.4.\n\nThe Gaming industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 85, which puts it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Meme stock rallies are back. Some stocks have catapulted without any catalysts or meaningful developments. Despite the obvious bubble, investors continue to pour into these meme stocks, hoping that other people will bid up prices even higher.\n\nWhile meme stock rallies can feel euphoric for people who got in early, we all know how they end at this point. Many meme stocks lose half of their value within a few months, while other stocks are more than 90% down from their all-time highs.\n\nHowever, the phrase \u201cmeme stock\u201d has started to include legitimate companies. Just because a company is outperforming the stock market by a wide margin doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a meme stock. The term has become more broad to include more companies, but the original meme stocks still remain troubling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high of seeing your meme stock trade gaining momentum won\u2019t mean much in the long run if you see your returns evaporate. These are some of the meme stocks to sell before they implode.\n\nGamestop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGamestop (NYSE:GME) is the original meme stock that started it all. Although shares are well-removed from their 2021 highs, the stock has shown signs of life with a 45% year-to-date gain. Although the company has plenty of fans due to nostalgia and recent stock gains, its business is flailing in the wind. Net sales dipped by 29% YOY in Q1 2024 to reach $882 million.\n\nWhile the company reported declining revenue, it\u2019s worse due to a $32.3 million net loss the company incurred in the quarter. While the net loss was worse in Q1 2023, it\u2019s not a good sign that Gamestop is burning through cash while seeing its underlying business shrink.\n\nGamestop closed the quarter with $1.083 billion in cash compared to $848.3 million in current liabilities. Low interest rates on the company\u2019s debt will minimize costs, but Gamestop still looks like a company on life support. The retailer has closed 54 stores year-to-date which is higher than the number of stores it closed last year.\n\nAMC (AMC) In this photo illustration the AMC Entertainment Holdings logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen. APE stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC (NYSE:AMC) is another original meme stock, but it hasn\u2019t had the same luck as Gamestop to start the year. Shares are down by 15% year-to-date but enjoyed a brief spike after GME stock got brought back into the spotlight. AMC is also more than 98% lower than its 5-year high.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t going to the movie theaters as they did in the past, and that\u2019s likely not going to change. Streaming platforms make it more convenient and affordable to watch movies. Why spend money on movie tickets, gas, parking, overpriced food, and other expenses when you can wait for the same movie to show up on your streaming platform a few months later?\n\nStory continues\n\nThe greater access to old and new entertainment makes movies less relevant. Q1 2024 results highlight this trend, as revenue dipped slightly YOY. The company also reported a $163.5 million net loss which is somehow an improvement from Q1 2023. AMC only has $624.2 million left as cash and cash equivalents, so it doesn\u2019t have much wiggle room.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is one of the many hydrogen and EV stocks that rose to prominence in 2021 only to crash hard a year later. While a small number of these stocks have recovered since then, Plug Power is among hydrogen and EV stocks that aren\u2019t anywhere close to its all-time high. The company created the first commercially viable market for hydrogen fuel cell technology, but that hasn\u2019t resulted in good returns for investors.\n\nShares are down by more than 96% from their all-time high and have registered a 46% year-to-date loss. Stock gains aren\u2019t the only thing lacking with this company. Revenue dropped by 43% YOY in the first quarter, totaling $120.3 million. Plug Power also concluded the quarter with a $296 million net loss.\n\nRevenue and net income are both declining as the company continues to burn through cash. This company had its day as a meme stock, but there\u2019s no reason to buy shares at this time.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Grapevine, TX-based GameStop (NYSE:GME)\u00a0is a global operator of video game retail stores, with an online presence as well. The company focuses on the U.S. market, but has presence in Canada, Australia and Europe under other banners, selling a range of gaming products as well as other collectibles and technology at its locations.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that meeting consumers where they are is the most important. With gamers increasingly buying their games and accessories online, it\u2019s unclear what unique competitive advantage GameStop has long-term. This is the key thesis behind why the stock has declined of late.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s dive into a few more reasons why GameStop appears to have more room to decline, and why this meme stock is one worth avoiding.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDisappointing Financials The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite seeing incredible recent surges tied to hype around Keith Gill\u2019s return to social media and expectations of another short squeeze, these recent pops have been short-lived. In fact, any sort of speculative buying frenzy has seemed to die down quicker than the one before it, with GME stock losing steam much quicker this time around.\n\nThis week, the stock is down considerably as investors are clearly taking a more skeptical view of the company\u2019s fundamentals. GameStop\u2019s Q1 2024 sales declined to $882 million, driving a $32.3 million loss. According to analysts, GME is a sell, with price targets constantly downgraded due to lack of turnaround strategies.\n\nGameStop\u2019 core business of physical game sales faces severe challenges from the digital gaming shift. Revenue has been falling, and cost-cutting offers limited relief. Without a successful business model pivot, GameStop\u2019s long-term outlook remains bleak despite occasional meme stock-driven surges.\n\nHighest Price In Over a Month In this photo illustration the stock trading graph of GameStop seen on a smartphone screen. GME stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn July 16, GME\u00a0stock reached a one-month high above $27 per share. Despite Roaring Kitty\u2019s recent low profile and lack of commentary on the company, the stock rose 5% in a month and 2% that day, fueled by ongoing meme stock interest.\n\nOf course, since this most recent pop, the stock has retreated. Currently, GME stock trades hands around $24 per share, with more downside likely ahead.\n\nGameStop gained fame in 2021 when amateur traders drove its stock price higher, causing Wall Street turmoil. The stock quieted down but surged in May after Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) tweeted a meme and again in June following his first livestream and share purchase in three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoaring Kitty\u2019s silence led to a sharp drop in GME, though it gradually rebounded last week. Investors remain interested in risky assets, especially after the weekend\u2019s political turmoil. However, with strong anticipation building around Kamala Harris, it appears a number of top Trump-related meme stocks have underperformed of late.\n\nGME Stock Still Looks Like a Loser A Gamestop (GME) video game store in the Herald Square shopping district in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s underlying business remains troubled with Q4 sales dropping 28% to $882 million and net losses matching forecasts. CEO Ryan Cohen has capitalized on the situation, raising $933 million from stock sales, boosting GameStop\u2019s cash reserves to nearly $2 billion. While this prevents immediate bankruptcy, it also dilutes shareholders in a big way. With over 306 million shares outstanding and authorization for up to 1 billion common shares, further dilution is possible.\n\nGameStop faces challenges as digital gaming reduces the need for physical game retailers. With a valuation of $11 billion, its market is shrinking. While niche demand exists, GameStop is better suited as a trading stock than a long-term investment. Thus, this is a stock to avoid right now, in my view.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "On July 15, after two years in the top job, U.K. luxury brand\u00a0Burberry Group (OTCMKTS:BURBY) fired CEO Jonathan Akeroyd. While I doubt Akeroyd is a contender for the worst CEOs of all time list, his tenure there was much shorter than the average tenure of 8.9 years for S&P 500 chief executives.\n\nI don\u2019t follow Burberry closely enough to know why Akeroyd was sacked. It didn\u2019t help that its revenues fell, and it lost money in the first half of 2024.\n\nWhat qualifies someone for the worst CEOs list? Well, declining revenue and a lack of profits will do it. Bad acquisitions count. So, too, does a poor job of delivering long-term returns for shareholders. As for excessive compensation, it only seems to matter if the first three points are in play.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYale Insights published a story in January that said Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff was one of the best CEOs in 2023, while Ryan Cohen, head of GameStop (NYSE:GME), was one of the worst.\n\nMore than halfway through 2024, here are three companies that ought to ditch their CEOs.\n\nVentas (VTR) Senior Woman Sitting In Chair And Talking With Nurse In Retirement Home\n\nSource: Monkey Business Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nVentas (NYSE:VTR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns healthcare-related real estate. Its CEO is Debra Cafaro. She has held the top job since March 1999 and added the chairman\u2019s role in January 2003.\n\nCafaro was hired to rescue the REIT, and she did. However, the REIT\u2019s stock performance wasn\u2019t good during her tenure. Over the past 25 years and four months, VTR stock has generated a cumulative return of 766%, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.9%.\n\nThat\u2019s not a terrible performance, but it must be noted that all of these gains were achieved before May 2012, so it\u2019s gone sideways for the past 12 years.\n\nI recommended Ventas stock in June 2018. As I noted, she increased the REIT\u2019s market capitalization from $200 million in 1999 to $25 billion in June 2018, a CAGR of 27%.\n\nAt 66, it\u2019s time to find someone younger to run the business. She could remain chairman while somebody else works on boosting its share price.\n\nNike (NKE) Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) stock has lost 33% of its value in 2024. CEO John Donahoe, the athletic footwear giant hired in January 2020, is struggling to keep the company growing.\n\nAt the end of June, it reported Q4 2024 results that included sales guidance for 2025, saying they will be down 4%-6% in 2025. Analysts have abandoned it in droves since. Today, it\u2019s a moderate buy (15 buy ratings), down from Strong Buy (21 buy ratings) a month ago.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cManagement credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty,\u201d CNBC reported Stifel analyst Jim Duffy\u2019s comments after the release of its poor earnings.\n\nExcept for the March 2020 correction, NKE stock hasn\u2019t traded lower in Donahoe\u2019s 55-month tenure. Considering he is the 33rd highest-paid S&P 500 CEO in 2023 at $33.8 million, that\u2019s not a flattering juxtaposition.\n\nAt 64, it\u2019s time to give someone else a try.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop bulls will consider my words heresy, especially since its shares are up 44% in 2024. However, I don\u2019t think Ryan Cohen is CEO material for a video game retailer badly needing a makeover.\n\nTo make matters worse, he\u2019s been greenlit to buy other stocks with the company\u2019s $4 billion cash hoard. Naturally, the board\u2019s going to let him stick around to see some of his bets play out.\n\nCohen first became involved in GameStop in August 2020 and became its CEO in September 2023. Since then, the co-founder of Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) has invested in GME stock, which has increased by nearly 2,000%.\n\nWhy ditch someone responsible for this move?\n\nIf the board doesn\u2019t hire someone who knows how to turn its core business around, in five years, there will be nothing but stocks left as assets. With an enterprise value of $10.4 billion, 318x its EBITDA, it is valued like a tech stock rather than a down-on-its-luck video game retailer.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meme stocks, fueled by social media hype, can soar or crash rapidly. While some see potential for explosive gains, others pose a high risk. So, how to navigate this wild ride? Hot companies with strong fundamentals and a clear growth path might be worth a closer look, even if they have meme stock buzz.\n\nOn the other hand, companies with shaky finances or no concrete plan for future success are generally best avoided, regardless of online chatter. Ultimately, in-depth research beyond the memes is key to separating potential diamonds from the rough.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the general wisdom most rational investors should follow anyway. At the same time, influential traders like \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 continue to prove that some speculation may pay handsomely. That contradiction leaves most investors wondering what to do: chase what may be free money or end up another sad story burned by FOMO? Let\u2019s look at some of the most popular meme stocks and identify which of the two scenarios is more likely to occur.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock is FOMO and nothing else. While that\u2019s arguably true for most meme stocks, it\u2019s especially true for AMC.\n\nI say that because AMC\u2019s spikes in 2024 happen very quickly \u2014 over a few days at most \u2014 and then reverse course. Thus, once share prices rise, there\u2019s a rapid emergence of fear of missing out. That\u2019s a recipe for trouble and quick losses.\n\nI also think investors should avoid AMC for the same general reasons most analysts advise against it: The company isn\u2019t growing and continues to produce substantial losses. So, it\u2019s fundamentally weak. Furthermore, streaming is here to stay and AMC cannot compete with changing movie consumption tastes. Younger generations haven\u2019t grown up with the same movie-going experiences that existed decades ago. Preferences are shifting toward at-home streaming. That shift ruins the economics of movie theater operators like AMC.\n\nThat truth \u2014 combined with the short duration of meme price spike opportunities in AMC \u2014 makes it one to avoid overall.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) would be an easy stock to avoid if investing were simply an objective game. It isn\u2019t. Various subjective factors are always at play, and social media has fuelled those factors.\n\nSo, what I\u2019m trying to say here is simple. While GameStop\u2019s revenues are falling and EPS continues to move deeper into the negative, share prices are likely to rise soon. Blame politics and the polarization of everything through social media if you\u2019re looking for a scapegoat. But no matter how you feel about it, CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s recent tweets endorsing Trump in 2024 have the potential to spike share share prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven his previous positions regarding CEOs and political postings, are those tweets hypocritical? Absolutely.\n\nHave we also seen how powerful such tweets can be in moving speculative investments higher in the recent past? Also, \u2018yes\u2019. That\u2019s the nature of our world today, and it\u2019s a powerful reason to believe that GameStop could pop again as it aligns \u2014 or is aligned by its CEO \u2014 with the right.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) Person holding smartphone with webpage of US audio recognition company SoundHound Inc. (SOUN) on screen in front of logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf my hunch is right, SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) will probably produce free money for investors in the coming weeks. It all relates to the relationship between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and SoundHound AI.\n\nThe reason for leaving SoundHound AI will move higher relates to the second quarter performance of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. TSMC beat revenue and profit expectations upon releasing its Q2 earnings recently. That\u2019s a strong signal to the markets that the AI hardware boom remains in full swing. That\u2019s a strong signal that Nvidia will continue to be strong overall \u2013 and positive news in light of recent growing concern \u2013 as it is one of TSMC\u2019s most important customers.\n\nNvidia is an investor in SoundHound AI. We learned much more about that relationship earlier this year with the release of Nvidia\u2019s 13F filing. It indicated that voice recognition software has a huge potential growth market for found-use applications, from restaurant ordering to automotive. The point here is that investors will be looking at SoundHound again, as Nvidia should rebound on the positive news surrounding TSMC\u2019s Q2 earnings.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a meme stock to avoid, in my opinion. There are simply too many issues with the company to consider it a glass-half-full scenario.\n\nYes, consumer demand for the R1SUVuv continues to strengthen; however, investors must look beyond that and consider the bigger picture. Rivian reiterated 2024 production guidance in its June delivery announcement. Investors should continue to expect substantial losses and profoundly negative per-share earnings from Rivian in 2024 with sub-9% growth. There is no positive surprise on the horizon right now.\n\nRivian\u2019s net losses grew in Q1, approaching $1.5 billion. Those are not encouraging figures for investors. Remember, Rivian IPO\u2019d at $130 back in 2021. Shares now sell for $17. Shares have declined more than 21% year-to-date, even with a recent turnaround. Rivian is too risky, and it\u2019s better to err on caution.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ: BYND) will certainly advance as the stock and company prospects worsen. The most recent news from the company is that it is in talks with bondholders about balance sheet restructuring.\n\nBonds are debt the company owes to various investor groups, and the restructuring talks indicate that Beyond Meat is in deep trouble. With this latest move, Beyond Meat\u2019s management is clearly signaling increasing bankruptcy risk. The company\u2019s cash burn issues and deep net losses are well known. The restructuring talks will only heighten fears that Beyond Meat is incapable of repaying its debts.\n\nThe simple fact is that Beyond Meat products have not been met with the demand anticipated by the company and investors earlier. Revenues fell 18% in the first quarter, exemplifying that truth. The news will create a short-selling opportunity, but there is no reason to expect share prices to rise reasonably soon.\n\nChargePoint Holdings (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nChargePoint Holdings (NYSE:CHPT) is at risk of bankruptcy, but if it can avoid that, I can see reasons to invest in the stock now.\n\nLet me just substantiate my first point about bankruptcy risk. ChargePoint Holdings has an Altman Z-Score of -1.92. That number indicates a possibility of bankruptcy in the next two years. That score isn\u2019t the only red flag for the company either. If ChargePoint Holdings can avoid bankruptcy, there are some real positives ahead.\n\nRevenues are expected to grow by nearly 27% in 2025, and losses should narrow substantially during the same timeframe. That expectation is prompted by rate cut expectations and a resurgent EV sector next year.\n\nSo, investing in CHPT shares might be free money right now. Top-line growth is expected to be even stronger in 2026, and ChargePoint is expected to begin producing per-share earnings at the same time. Those who jump in now and hold on might be setting themselves up for a good amount of free money.\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (DNA) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American biotechnology company Ginkgo Bioworks Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. DNA stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nGinkgo Bioworks (NYSE:DNA) sounds like a deeply interesting company and potential investment. The company continues to promise to enable customers to program cells as easily as we program computers. It is building a platform for biotech partners to realize that dream, but the ambitious goal is fraught with real-world constraints.\n\nSynthetic biology is a complex field that tends to produce losses, as does the wider biotech sector. The company\u2019s problem is twofold. First, revenues that highly depend on sales of its synthetic biology platform continue to fall. Second, the company is nowhere near financial stability.\n\nThe company announced that it expects EBITDA breakeven by late 20rt. That\u2019s far away in most investors\u2019 eyes, never mind that EBITDA doesn\u2019t consider taxes, depreciation and amortization.\u00a0 The company is reducing labor costs by 25% at least. How is it expected to produce meaningful advancements in its platform? The answer is they\u2019re unlike, but that\u2019s the nature of balancing share prices and jobs at publicly listed firms.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Short squeeze opportunities present short-term buying opportunities for retail investors who get in early. Then, the stock inevitably crashes down to where it was before the trading frenzy began. Shares are up by 71% year-to-date and already have two massive spikes in the chart. Those spikes demonstrate that the stock price dropped just as quickly as it rose.\n\nThe underlying business does not warrant a $10 billion market cap or a price-to-earnings ratio of 305x. The company\u2019s revenue decreased by 29% year-over-year in the first quarter, coming in at $882 million. The company\u2019s net loss came in at $32.3 million. A company with high net losses and declining revenue won\u2019t last long.\n\nThe original meme stock is due for a 50% pullback at the minimum. Speculators have driven up the price this year, but fundamentals prevail in the long run. It\u2019s only a matter of time when the meme frenzy turns into a rush for the exits.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCiscoSystems (NASDAQ:CSCO) looks like it\u2019s going to be dead money for a few years. That\u2019s been the case since 2019, as shares are down by 18% over the past five years. The stock\u2019s 3.3% yield compensates a little, but it stings if you look at how index funds have performed during the same stretch.\n\nDividend growth has slowed in recent years, with the quarterly payout only inching up from $0.39 per share to $0.40 per share this year. That\u2019s an uninspiring 2.6% year-over-year increase for a stock that has underperformed the stock market for several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecent financial results don\u2019t offer any reason for encouragement. Revenue dropped by 13% year-over-year while net income tumbled by 41% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Next quarter\u2019s guidance implies another big revenue drop for the company. Cisco has been the type of stock that only goes up if it reports bad results instead of horrendous results. It\u2019s best to avoid a stock that has disappointed its investors for several years.\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) is having an identity crisis as booming pandemic gains become a distant memory. It was easy for Zoom to exceed investors\u2019 expectations when people were forced to stay in their homes and had very few options for getting out of the house. Zoom is only known for its video conferencing software, and it doesn\u2019t have a moat in the industry.\n\nSeveral tech giants have video conferencing technology that allow people to meet virtually. These tech conglomerates also don\u2019t charge for their software, making the barrier to entry quite low. While Zoom has free plans, it needs customers to use paid plans to stay in business.\n\nFirst quarter results suggest that growth is at a standstill. The company only increased its revenue by 3.2% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. A growth stock can\u2019t deliver gains if it\u2019s producing low revenue growth. The company has had several quarters of low-single-digit revenue growth which make it look overvalued, despite the P/E of 22x. Investors haven\u2019t been convinced. They\u2019re heading for the exits based on Zoom\u2019s 15% year-to-date drop. Shares are down by roughly 90% from their all-time high.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Highlights: Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) Vs The Rest Of The Specialty Retail Stocks\n\nEarnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q1 now behind us, let\u2019s have a look at Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) and its peers.\n\nSome retailers try to sell everything under the sun, while others\u2014appropriately called Specialty Retailers\u2014focus on selling a narrow category and aiming to be exceptional at it. Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, and specialty retail stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 7.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nUlta (NASDAQ:ULTA)\n\nOffering high-end prestige brands as well as lower-priced, mass-market ones, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American retailer that sells makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products.\n\nUlta reported revenues of $2.73 billion, up 3.5% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company:\u00a0Although its EPS beat analysts' estimates thanks to its better-than-expected same-store sales growth (1.6% vs estimates of 1.5%), its full-year revenue and earnings guidance missed Wall Street's projections.\n\n\u201cThe Ulta Beauty team delivered net sales growth of 3.5% and comparable sales growth of 1.6% in a dynamic operating environment. I am proud of how our teams continued to execute our transformational agenda, adapt to a rapidly evolving marketplace, and thoughtfully manage expenses across the enterprise,\u201d said Dave Kimbell, chief executive officer. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nUlta delivered the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group. The stock is up 1.9% since reporting and currently trades at $393.25.\n\nIs now the time to buy Ulta?

It was a strong quarter for the company with optimistic earnings guidance for the full year and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates. Dick's Total Revenue\n\nDick's achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 10.8% since reporting. It currently trades at $215.99.\n\nIs now the time to buy Dick's?

It was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nAs expected, the stock is down 37.9% since the results and currently trades at $2.36.\n\nRead our full analysis of Sportsman's Warehouse's results here.\n\nAcademy Sports (NASDAQ:ASO)\n\nFounded in 1938 as a tire shop before expanding into fishing equipment, Academy Sports & Outdoor (NASDAQ:ASO) sells a broad selection of sporting goods but is still known for its outdoor activity merchandise.\n\nAcademy Sports reported revenues of $1.36 billion, down 1.4% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Overall, it was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 4.5% since reporting and currently trades at $55.85.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Academy Sports here, it's free.\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME)\n\nDrawing gaming fans with demo units set up with the latest releases, GameStop (NYSE:GME) sells new and used video games, consoles, and accessories, as well as pop culture merchandise.\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $881.8 million, down 28.7% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 11.4%. Zooming out, it was a weak quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nGameStop had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth among its peers.

        "content": "I\u2019ve seen my fair share of fads come and go. Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the popular trading app favored by Gen Z and millennial investors, offers many stocks I\u2019d equate to fads. The platform has enabled a new generation to dive into the stock market. However, some of the most hyped-up stocks on Robinhood have underlying businesses that are destined to fail in the long-run. Their outdated business models simply can\u2019t keep up with the rapidly evolving tastes of younger consumers.\n\nHistory has shown that companies that fail to innovate and adapt to the next generation\u2019s needs eventually fizzle out. They may limp along for a while. But declining sales and market share will eventually catch up to them. And if these companies are already unprofitable, their demise is likely even more imminent.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019ll be discussing three Robinhood stocks that I believe are prime candidates to sell before Gen Z moves on. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The logo for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC) is displayed above a movie theater entrance.\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) operates movie theaters, but faces major headwinds as consumer preferences shift to streaming. The company completed a $250 million share sale in May, diluting shareholders by around 25% and causing the stock price to plummet more than 14%.\n\nAMC has also repeatedly tapped equity markets to fund its operating losses and repay its substantial $8.6 billion debt load, as the value of its liabilities now exceeds its assets. Analysts expect AMC\u2019s revenue to drop 7% in 2024, and the company is not projected to turn a profit. Net income is negative, even if you exclude interest expenses. Robinhood Stocks: AMC financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe AMC\u2019s movie theater business model is dying in the face of the convenience offered by streaming platforms. Younger generations increasingly prefer streaming over going to theaters. Unless AMC can adapt, I don\u2019t see how the company can survive long-term, given its financial challenges and the secular decline of movie theaters.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nVirgin Galactic\u2019s (NYSE:SPCE) future looks grim, as the company faces mounting financial challenges which have been partly driven by a flawed business model. The space tourism company has reported more than $100 million in losses each quarter, with its cash reserves dwindling to $867 million as of Q1 2024. I believe Virgin Galactic is on a path to further dilution and reverse stock splits in the coming quarters as it starts running out of money. It\u2019s hard to argue that cash won\u2019t run out by 2026.\n\nStory continues SPCE cash, revenue, EBIT chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company already implemented a 1-for-20 reverse split in June 2024 to regain compliance with NYSE listing requirements after its stock price fell below $1.\n\nAnalysts have raised concerns about Virgin Galactic\u2019s long-term viability, with some even suggesting bankruptcy risk is on the horizon. The company\u2019s space tourism tickets are extremely expensive, yet it still operates at a steep loss. In Q1 2024, Virgin Galactic reported a net loss of $102 million on a mere $2 million in revenue. I think the company is simply ahead of its time. Right now, there isn\u2019t enough demand or hype to make its business model profitable. As cash reserves dwindle, I expect SPCE stock will continue to dilute toward zero.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) stock has soared lately, thanks to the resurgence of the meme stock phenomenon, but I believe investors should be cautious. The company\u2019s Q1 2024 results were disappointing, with net sales down significantly from $1.24 billion in Q1 2023 to $882 million. GameStop is also still unprofitable, with a net loss of $32.3 million for the quarter.\n\nThe only analyst currently covering the stock, Michael Pachter at Wedbush, has a sell rating and recently lowered his price target. I think Pachter is right to be skeptical. GameStop may have over $1 billion in cash thanks to issuing more shares, but without a clear turnaround plan, I worry the company will simply continue to burn through that money. And why hold GME stock in the first place if management just punishes big rallies by selling more shares?\n\nIn addition, the shift to digital gaming continues to be a huge headwind for GameStop\u2019s core business of selling physical games. Revenue has been in decline for years, and cost-cutting can only go so far. Unless GameStop can successfully pivot its business model, which I\u2019m doubtful about given the entrenched competition from the likes of Steam, the company looks to be on an unsustainable path. The meme stock hype may lead to short-term pops, but the company\u2019s underlying fundamentals paint a grim long-term picture for GameStop investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty vs. Risks: Why Investors Should Avoid GameStop Stock Now",
        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) seems to be keeping its meme stock status standing. Indeed, with Keith Gill\u2019s influence, this stock has seen incredible surges in recent years. However, investors now appear to be proceeding with caution regarding GameStop stock right now.\n\nGill\u2019s return led to renewed retail interest, but the lack of positive news caused a sharp sell-off in GameStop stock. Many questions remain about the stock\u2019s future direction. GameStop stock is likely to continue falling. Let\u2019s dive into why that may be the case.\n\nVolatility and GameStop Stock\n\nGameStop\u2019s stock rose nearly 8% over the past week to about $26 per share at the time of writing, outperforming the Nasdaq\u2019s 0.43% gain. This increase came despite meme influencer Roaring Kitty, known for driving the 2021 meme stock surge, remaining absent from the spotlight.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGill returned online in May after a three-year hiatus, boosting GME stock with tweets and a June livestream. He increased his holdings to 9 million shares, worth $233 million, and recently tweeted a cartoon dog, impacting Chewy\u2019s (NYSE:CHWY) stock.\n\nWith Gill quiet for nearly a month, GameStop\u2019s latest price rise followed its new collectibles initiative, marking a shift from traditional video game retail.\n\nGameStop announced a $25,000 reward for the rare black parallel Lionel Messi sticker from the 2024 Panini Copa America collection. The sticker must have a PSA grade of 6 or higher, and the promotion runs until the end of 2024.\n\nThis initiative supports GameStop\u2019s strategy to expand beyond video games and capitalize on Messi\u2019s popularity after his move to Inter Miami.\n\nThat said, the question is whether such initiatives will be enough to promote continued share price growth moving forward. There are plenty of skeptics out there who are rightly concerned.\n\nRoaring Kitty Poses Mystery\n\nGill gained fame in 2021, leading retail investors to propel GameStop\u2019s stock to new heights. By April 2021, his holdings exceeded $34 million, as shown in a WallStreetBets post.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain if he sold those shares, but selling at the peak could have netted him over $60 million, which raises questions about his recent investments. Plenty of questions have abounded as to where Gill got the money to increase his bets on GameStop so dramatically.\n\nGill\u2019s recently trading drew the Massachusetts Securities Division\u2019s scrutiny, leading to an investigation for possible stock manipulation. Additionally, E*Trade contemplated closing his account over concerns. As of June 2, his portfolio indicated nearly $211 million in GameStop, requiring a 250% payout increase since his last sale three years earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nGill disclosed owning 6.6% of Chewy\u2019s stock worth over $240 million as of July, raising questions about how he financed this transaction. While he could have sold GameStop shares, he hadn\u2019t updated his Reddit followers on his holdings.\n\nIf Gill has moved on to other meme stocks entirely, the bull thesis behind GameStop may not be as solid as many \u201capes\u201d investing in this stock may think.\n\nGME Stock Looks Risky Here\n\nFor long-term investors, speculative assets such as meme stocks or short squeeze candidates don\u2019t usually fit the bill as appropriate investments. These stocks tend to be highly volatile, and that\u2019s certainly the case for GameStop. Outside of speculative demand, there are few growth drivers here that justify the sort of valuation the company currently trades at, never mind where some bulls think the stock could be headed.\n\nIt\u2019s my view that GameStop and other highly volatile plays are best avoided right now, from both sides of the trade. Shorting or going long (either directly or via options) is a risky strategy. And with so much volatility already priced into this stock\u2019s borrow rate and implied options volatility, there\u2019s not much to gain from betting on this stock. That\u2019s my two cents.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nLegendary Investor Predicts: \u201cForget AI...

        "content": "When it comes to meme stock news as of late, Keith Gill has certainly been the driver of most investor attention to this space. Various meme stocks have surged on Roaring Kitty\u2019s involvement in simply noting his trades. Much of this sentiment makes sense when one harkens back to the price action of 2021 and the incredible meme mania we saw then.\n\nThat said, many top meme stocks have since lost their luster and momentum, falling once again on strong short-seller interest. The question is whether retail investors have enough juice to support the top meme stocks and propel them higher, particularly as many of the management teams behind these beaten-down businesses look for reasons to sell shares into any strength to raise capital.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the top three meme stocks that could be poised to crash and burn if this trend continues.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock has mostly languished this year, punctuated by brief spikes such as a 135% surge over two days. Despite hopes among meme-stock enthusiasts for a revival akin to 2021, sustained positive momentum seems unlikely. While many may remain cautious about AMC, others may certainly be considering the potential catalysts that could transform its fortunes.\n\nMuch ado has been made around blockbuster movie slates, improving foot traffic, and rising ticket prices. But overall, these trends have been nowhere near enough to stop the bleeding from a loss perspective. The company has been forced to restructure its debt and extend maturities, moves that have offered glimmers of hope for certain investors. However, many others have viewed these moves skeptically, and rightfully so. AMC remains a heavily debt-burdened company with an operating model that appears to be fundamentally unsound.\n\nDespite a recent uptick, AMC\u2019s long-term outlook remains bleak. The company\u2019s reliance on increasing its share count to boost its balance sheet amid historically low foot traffic suggests unsustainable outcomes over the long term. Many see parallels with Blockbuster\u2019s fate, viewing AMC as surviving on borrowed time despite retail investor support.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a top video game retailer, GameStop (NYSE:GME) has been seeing growth deceleration pick up in recent years. Of course, the pandemic didn\u2019t help. And when the company was in its darkest days, it\u2019s true that Keith Gill and millions of other retail traders stepped in to save the day.\n\nThe thing is, investors have to question whether this is really a viable long-term investing strategy. The company\u2019s previous surges were clearly speculative in nature. And it\u2019s unclear whether the so-called \u201capes\u201d and \u201cdegenerates\u201d that supported GameStop the last time around will have enough dry powder to do so again.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile GME is still appealing to fans of gaming due to its consoles, merchandise, and video games, the numbers tell a different story. GameStop\u2019s revenue saw a 29.7% drop year-over-year, while the market only anticipated an 11.4% decline. This past quarter was particularly challenging, marked by revenue and EPS shortfalls without providing a future outlook. GameStop\u2019s stock plummeted 45.5% post-results, now trading around $27 per share.\n\nChewy (CHWY) Image of a Chewy (CHWY) branded delivery box in the middle of a well-lit living room.\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nChewy (NYSE:CHWY) saw a steep decline in its shares in recent days as investors reassessed signals from meme stock influencer \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d Initially, Chewy surged 34% last week after Keith Gill posted a cartoon dog on his X account, hinting at potential interest in the retailer. However, following news that Keith Gill had officially bought 6.6% of outstanding Chewy shares, amounting to roughly $250 million in the pet products retailer, shares of CHWY stock have been on a rather protracted downtrend.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see if this continues. Gill\u2019s bet on Chewy is certainly one that falls into the curious category for many investors. The company\u2019s troubled financial picture is one that many long-term value-focused investors wouldn\u2019t touch.\n\nBut for Gill, this is the kind of beaten-down stock with a turnaround story (and leadership from Ryan Cohen) that could have the potential to surge. We\u2019ll have to see. But for now, I think speculating on such a stock may be very foolish.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it.

Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023.

Overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\n\u201cOur second quarter performance reflects the benefits of expanded distribution, product innovation and the strengthening of salon demand trends in our Beauty Systems Group segment, offset by moderating traffic and customer purchasing patterns in our Sally Beauty segment resulting from the inflationary environment,\u201d said Denise Paulonis, president and chief executive officer.

        "title": "Is GameStop Stock Really Worth $11 Billion? No.",
        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has swung wildly since Roaring Kitty returned to social media to reiterate just how much he likes the video game retailer. And though shares are down sharply from those peaks, what may not be clear to many is that GameStop stock continues to trend higher.\n\nJust because it is not acting like a moonshot doesn\u2019t mean the stock isn\u2019t still rising. GameStop is down 61% from its May high point but up 161% from their April lows. More importantly, after the initial frenzy died down, GameStop stock is still growing. Shares are up 37% since the end of May.\n\nYet is the stock worth it? Should investors who remained on the sidelines buy in now? Let\u2019s take a closer look at GameStop stock to see if maybe it should be put on your buy list now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMore Sizzle Than Steak\n\nRoaring Kitty, who\u2019s real name is Keith Gill, ignited of firestorm of trading in GameStop shares by first cryptically posting he was still interested in the video game retailer and then showing he had amassed a large, valuable position in the stock.\n\nIt got a lot more valuable after traders piled back into the stock, so much so that Gill came under regulatory scrutiny for trying to manipulate the market. Online brokerages were also considering removing him from their platforms. While the probes are ongoing, you can say that Gill isn\u2019t willing to put his money where his mouth is.\n\nBut now that the hoopla has died down, GameStop stock continues to rise. Gill has said he is confident in the ability of chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen to turn the company around.\n\nWhile investors were disappointed, Cohen didn\u2019t share more of his vision for the company during the retailer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, they\u2019ve shrugged off the opacity and continue to buy up the stock.\n\nLosing Money, Raising Cash\n\nThat is the crux of the investment thesis right now. Can Cohen turn the business around? Also, exactly how will he achieve this?\n\nGameStop\u2019s business is still deteriorating. Fourth-quarter sales fell 28% to $882 million, which was the midpoint guidance it gave last month. Net losses of $32.5 million also hit the exact midpoint of the video game retailer\u2019s forecast.\n\nYet Cohen was opportunistic. He used the renewed interest in the company to sell more stock. GameStop raised some $933 million from the stock sale, and now has nearly $2 billion in cash available to it. That ensures the retailer isn\u2019t going bankrupt any time soon, but it also dilutes shareholders.\n\nGameStop charter authorizes it to issue as many as 1 billion shares of common stock and up to 5 million shares of preferred stock. The retailer has more than 306 million shares outstanding, meaning even more dramatic dilution could be coming.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd yet investors are no closer to understanding how the business will be transformed.\n\nWhat Is the Plan?\n\nAs I discussed recently, Cohen has tried numerous tricks to spark sales growth. Whether it is turning the retailer into an e-commerce destination, selling connected TVs and Razor scooters or launching a non-fungible token marketplace, these have all been far afield of its core business and none have worked.\n\nSo what is left for GameStop to do? As video games have been digitized and moved online, and companies are releasing them directly onto their own sites and consoles, the need for the retailer diminishes.\n\nWhile there may always be a market for physical games, it is just going to be a very small niche. It means it is hard to justify a GameStop stock valued at $11 billion. Owning a small player in a small pond is fine but this is not a long-term investment. It is a trading stock.\n\nThat opens up a lot more risk in trying to time entry and exit points. It is best to just stay on the sidelines to see where exactly Cohen is trying to take GameStop stock and the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The glory days of the meme-stock phenomenon appear to be over. The heady days of 2021 when these names skyrocketed 30 or 40 times and stayed elevated for many months at a time appear to be long gone. On June 2, the leader of the meme-stock movement, Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, revealed that he had $211 million of GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and options and then scheduled an appearance on YouTube to discuss the company\u2019s outlook. The shares subsequently spiked to around $46.50 from their previous level of about $26.50. But on June 7, they were back down to $27, and on July 11, they closed at $25.57.\n\nThe episode suggests that anyone who buys meme stocks now has to be ready to quickly sell them on any spike, while any speculator who purchases meme stocks while they\u2019re elevated can lose a great deal of money. Also importantly, it\u2019s possible that Roaring Kitty sold all of his GameStop shares and options during last month\u2019s spike and will return to the hibernation that he underwent between 2021 and May 2024.\n\nIf Roaring Kitty does avoid the spotlight again, meme stocks may not rebound sharply for years and could generally keep falling going forward. With that warning in mind, here are three meme stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy ad in NYC\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarlier this month, Roaring Kitty disclosed that he owned 9 million shares of pet e-commerce company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). However, the shares actually fell sharply in the immediate wake of the investor\u2019s disclosure.\n\nThat dynamic suggests that Roaring Kitty cannot boost CHWY stock going forward.\n\nAlso negatively for CHWY stock, investment bank Argus on July 9 downgraded the name to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d Among the reasons for the move are declines in the company\u2019s user base, the stock\u2019s high valuation, and Argus\u2019 belief that the retailer will have to invest a great deal to support its upcoming foray into Canada.\n\nAmerica\u2019s economic slowdown could also hurt Chewy\u2019s, Argus warned. All of these negative catalysts make me view CHWY stock as one of the meme stocks to sell at this point.\n\nWith CHWY stock changing hands at a very high enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of over 50 times, Argus is right to be concerned about the retailer\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso negatively for the company, 52% of consumers surveyed by investment bank Evercore ISI recently reported shopping at Chewy\u2019s, down from 64% in 2022.\n\nGameStop (GME) In this photo illustration the GameStop (GME) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn May and June, GameStop sold $3 billion of its GME stock. Not only will all of those new shares put a great deal of downward pressure on the share price, but the company\u2019s rush to sell so many of its shares amid the meme-stock revival indicates that it\u2019s not very confident in its own outlook. And speaking of a lack of confidence, I have not seen any evidence of GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who\u2019s also a billionaire and the largest owner of GameStop stock, buying the company\u2019s shares this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, many speculators are probably holding GME stock in the belief that Roaring Kitty will make another appearance, sparking another brief rally in the name. But as I mentioned in the introduction to this column, it\u2019s entirely possible that Roaring Kitty sold all of his GME stock and the options that he held on GameStop. It\u2019s also possible that he will, emulating his modus operandi from 2021 to May 2024, stay out of public view for years to come.\n\nFinally, as I noted in a past column, GameStop\u2019s business model is broken.\n\nAMC (AMC) AMC movie theater front glowing in the setting sun with the name shining bright red. AMC stock.\n\nSource: Ian Dewar Photography / Shutterstock\n\nAMC\u2019s (NYSE:AMC) shares only rose about 20% during June\u2019s meme-stock rally, suggesting that the name is not going to benefit a great deal from any resurgence by the category going forward. And as I pointed out earlier in this column, such a resurgence may not occur, since Roaring Kitty may have sold his GME stock and options and could choose to remain silent for many years.\n\nOn the fundamental side, AMC on May 9 issued a negative announcement about its second-quarter results. Specifically, the movie theater owner stated that its Q2 financial performance may be meaningfully weaker than during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe company blamed the weakness on strikes lowering the number of film releases last quarter. But continued, negative, structural issues plaguing the U.S. movie theater business are likely as much or more to blame for the company\u2019s poor performance as strikes.\n\nIndeed, in Q1, attendance at the company\u2019s U.S. theaters sank 5.8% versus the same period a year earlier to 30.5 million, while its revenue fell 0.3% year-over-year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Meme Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Meme stocks looked to be on the comeback trail in May of this year after retail trader Keith Gill, known online as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d made a triumphant return to social media after a three-year hiatus. By posting only a few cryptic memes heralding his return, Gill managed to more than double the share prices of popular undervalued meme stocks such as GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).\n\nOther undervalued meme stocks, such as headphone maker Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) saw their stocks rise more than 20% on news of Gill\u2019s return. Meme stocks are defined as shares of a company that have gained viral popularity due to heightened social media attention. They tend to be stocks of once-dominant companies that have fallen on hard times and whose shares are heavily shorted on Wall Street.\n\nAs is typically the case, the meme stock rally of late May did not last long and most of the companies involved saw their share prices fall back to earth throughout June. The pullback has left many meme stocks deep in the red and looking cheap at current levels. Here are the seven most undervalued meme stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nWe\u2019ll start with GameStop. Setting aside the return of Roaring Kitty, the brick-and-mortar video game retailer continues to report abysmal financial results that are weighing on its share price. Results were particularly bad for this year\u2019s first quarter, which management issued along with plans to sell additional GME stock, further diluting the holdings of existing shareholders.\n\nThe end result is that GameStop stock has declined 50% from the peak it reached in mid-May this year when Roaring Kitty resurfaced. The company\u2019s shares are 70% below the all-time high they reached in January 2021 during the original meme stock craze. GameStop\u2019s sales in the first three months of this year totaled $881.8 million, down 29% from $1.237\r\nbillion a year ago. News of the stock dilution appears to have dampened enthusiasm over Roaring Kitty\u2019s return. That and a class-action lawsuit alleging a classic pump-and-dump.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) In this photo illustration, the Truth Social logo seen displayed on a smartphone with a photo of former US President Donald Trump displayed in the background. DJT stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s earnings look sterling when compared to the finances of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). The company, which runs the Truth Social platform that is essentially a clone of Twitter, reported a net loss for this year\u2019s first quarter of $327.6 million on less than $1 million in revenue. Consequently, it\u2019s been a bumpy ride for DJT stock in recent months.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe share price has fallen 55% from a peak reached in March of this year shortly after the company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). DJT stock also fell 15% after former President Donald Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts related to falsifying business documents in a criminal hush money case. More recently, the stock has fallen 30% in the last month.\n\nWhile the share price decline is disappointing, it has certainly made DJT stock cheaper to buy for investors with an appetite for risk.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis producer Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) has also been getting cheaper as its finances deteriorate. The company most recently reported a quarterly loss of $105 million and lowered its forward guidance as its sales continue to decline. The result is that TLRY stock has fallen 20% this year. Over five years, the stock has declined 96% and now trades deep down on the penny stock league tables.\n\nTilray said that it expects earnings of only $60 million to $63 million for its entire 2024 financial year. The new guidance is down from earlier estimates of $68 million to $78 million in earnings. Management said they no longer expect positive free cash flow this financial year. The deteriorating situation has raised concerns about Tilray\u2019s ability to continue operating. Still, TLRY stock is not available to buy for less than $2 a share.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is also trading in the penny stock range having decreased 30% year to date. As with the other undervalued meme stocks, BlackBerry\u2019s share price is declining as the company reports woefully bad financial results. In this year\u2019s first quarter, BlackBerry\u2019s net loss grew by nearly 300% as its sales continued to deteriorate. The former smartphone maker reported a Q1 loss of $42 million, which was 282% greater than a net loss of $11 million a year earlier.\n\nRevenue at BlackBerry totaled $144 million in Q1, down 61% from $373 million a year ago.\r\nThe poor results come as BlackBerry prepares to divide its cybersecurity business and its\r\nInternet of Things (IoT) division. BlackBerry is also cutting costs as its financial situation worsens. Earlier this year, the company eliminated 200 jobs and closed six of its 36 global offices. It remains to be seen if the measures will be enough to right the ship.\n\nBB stock has declined 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nFisker (FSRNQ) Smartphone with logo of American electric vehicle company Fisker Inc. in front of business website. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. Fisker stock. FSRN stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nNow for a bankruptcy filing. Electric vehicle start-up Fisker (OTC:FSRNQ) has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors and plans to sell its assets. The company\u2019s stock now trades for less than two cents on the over-the-counter market. But that hasn\u2019t stopped retail investors from bidding up this troubled meme stock. Fisker stock continues to pop occasionally as investors nibble at it, though the share price is down 99% on the year.\n\nFisker is the latest in a string of electric vehicle companies to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors, following Lordstown Motors. Analysts say the businesses are failing as the electric vehicle stock bubble bursts and consumers move away from battery-powered autos in favor of gas-electric hybrid models. Fisker made more than 10,000 vehicles in 2023 but delivered only about 4,700. This is the second time Fisker has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company now plans to sell its assets and restructure its debt.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company canopy growth cannabis, blurred marijuana in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nAnother cannabis stock. This one is Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQ:CGC). On the surface, things look to be improving for this company\u2019s stock. The share price has risen nearly 30% this year and is trading above $6. But don\u2019t be fooled. The gains and current share price are due to Canopy Growth executing a reverse stock split. Reverse stock splits are the opposite of regular stock splits. Rather than reduce the share price, they raise it by consolidating the stock.\n\nReverse stock splits are seen by markets as an act of desperation by companies that are trying to artificially boost their share price, often to avoid being delisted from an exchange. In the case of Canopy Growth, the company was in danger of being delisted by the Nasdaq exchange as its share price had been trading below $1. In response, the company consolidated its shares on a one-for-10 basis. Over the last five years, CGC stock has fallen 98% amid speculation that the company will file for bankruptcy.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Glendale, Arizona. AMC stock.\n\nSource: JJava Designs / Shutterstock\n\nWe\u2019ll end with another leading meme stock, AMC Entertainment. The largest U.S. movie theater chain saw its share price more than double when Roaring Kitty resurfaced. Unfortunately, the stock has since dropped 20% from a peak reached in mid-May and is on the cusp of falling into penny stock territory. In the last 12 months, AMC stock has decreased 85%, making the shares cheap if not undervalued.\n\nAMC Entertainment continues to struggle with a decline in moviegoers that began during the COVID-19 crisis and a big debt load that it took on during the pandemic when its theaters were closed or forced to operate at reduced capacity. At the start of this year, AMC had $8.6 billion of long-term debt, up from $5.2 billion before the pandemic. The company did manage to narrowly beat analysts\u2019 forecasts with its Q1 print. So there might still be hope for the company and its shareholders.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re looking for stocks to avoid, you might want to start with GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d the nom de plume of meme-stock investor extraordinaire, Keith Gill, bought into GameStop. Then, continuing on the Ryan Cohen theme, Gill bought shares of the online pet goods retailer that Cohen co-founded.\n\nGoogle \u201cKeith Gill\u2019s net worth\u201d and you\u2019ll get a lot of answers. A screenshot of Gill\u2019s portfolio in early June showed his net worth at least $289 million according to CNBC reporting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYou do not want to emulate what Roaring Kitty is doing with his largesse. To gain this kind of money, and then treat it so casually, is tantamount to financial malpractice.\n\nSure, he\u2019s not acting in an official role as a financial advisor. But plenty of people will think they too can strike lightning in a bottle.\n\nSo, let\u2019s explore three reasons to avoid all Roaring Kitty stocks.\n\nHe\u2019s Bet on Two Very Iffy Stocks\n\nTogether, GameStop and Chewy have generated $253 million in EBITDA in the trailing 12 months from revenue of $16.16 billion, an EBITDA margin of 1.6%. Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) EBITDA margin of 63.5% in the latest 12 months is 40x better.\n\nSuffice to say, the gap in quality between these two types of businesses, is \u201cGrand Canyon\u201d is size and scope.\n\nOn July 1, Gill filed his Schedule 13G indicating he held 9,001,000 shares of Chewy. These shares were bought June 24. Based on Chewy\u2019s current share price of $26.47, the 6.6% stake in Chewy is worth a little over $218 million.\n\nAccording to its latest proxy, that would make Gill the fourth-largest holder of Class A shares (1 vote each) behind only BC Partners \u2014 who own all 298.9 million Class B shares (10 votes each), which can be converted into Class A shares \u2014 Baillie Gifford & Co. (13.5%) and Vanguard (7.0%).\n\nExcept for Gill, All of Chewy\u2019s Top Investors are Diversified\n\nBC Partners is an alternative asset manager. By nature, its objective is to buy good businesses, improve them and then sell them for a big profit.\n\nIts most recent sale of Chewy stock was on July 1, selling 1.34 million Class A shares at prices between $29.44 and $32.47 a share. In January, it sold 12.325 million at $20.29, likely its biggest share sale yet.\n\nThe only reason BC Partners is still holding any shares five years after its IPO at $22 is to ensure they get a better return on their investment.\u00a0It is ready to exit, prices willing.\n\nOver 128 investments are valued at more than 170 billion euros ($183.87 billion). The upper middle market investor has plenty of diversification to enable it to wait for the best Chewy outcome. The same goes for Baillie Gifford and Vanguard.\n\nStory continues\n\nApparently, Gill has all his eggs in two baskets. Not even Warren Buffett is that focused on his investments. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to put Gill in the Investor Hall of Fame just yet.\n\nRyan Cohen Has Yet to Prove Himself\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to believe that on his own, Gill amassed the $218 million required to buy the 6.6% interest in Chewy.\n\nIt\u2019s a wild theory, given GameStop\u2019s board has given the green light for Cohen\u2019s joint roles of CEO and portfolio manager. Additionally, the company\u2019s two ATM (at-the-market) markets brought in $3 billion in new cash.\n\nRegardless if all of my speculation is poppycock, the important thing to remember about Ryan Cohen is that he has yet to prove himself. He couldn\u2019t make Chewy profitable as its CEO and he\u2019s spent close to four years on GameStop with no concrete plan for its revival. Thus, you ought to be very careful about following the moves of Roaring Kitty.\n\nThey\u2019re bound to come back to bite you.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "A pending or ongoing lawsuit isn\u2019t always a reliable indicator of stocks to sell, but, in many cases, investors should take litigation as a sign to dig beneath the surface.\n\nI\u2019d first caution retail investors not to take pending litigation as a sure sign of failure or risk; tons of legal firms push frivolous lawsuits in a bid to maximize their own income. Even if the litigant\u2019s motives aren\u2019t nefarious, law firms bring suits against companies for other reasons beyond just a payout; for example, last year, a group of nuns suedSmith & Wesson (NASDAQ:SWBI) for \u201cwrongdoing related to the marketing and sale of AR-15-style assault weapons.\u201d Likewise, Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) face near-constant lawsuits from minority shareholders \u2014 often with flimsy premises and thin evidence.\n\nStill, these stocks to sell combine the worst of both worlds: They\u2019re facing ongoing lawsuits, and in each of the three cases, the stock itself is a stinker.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGoodRx (GDRX) Magnifying glass looking at the GoodRx logo on the company Website\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoodRx (NASDAQ:GDRX) is facing a fresh lawsuit claiming the company misrepresented Kroger\u2019s (NYSE:KR) total contributions to its revenue. Specifically, the suit claims that GoodRx didn\u2019t inform investors that \u201cKroger accounted for less than 5% of the pharmacies accepting GoodRx discounts [but] was responsible for nearly 25% of GoodRx\u2019s total prescription transactions revenue.\u201d This misalignment exposes GoodRx to undue risk and, while management can run their operations as they choose, exposing shareholders to this level of systemic risk isn\u2019t good business. In some ways, I\u2019d call this a frivolous lawsuit \u2014 with merit, yes, but ultimately not enough to count it among the ranks of stocks to sell.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the only problem GoodRx faced in recent years.\n\nMore concerning to shareholders and customers alike is GoodRx\u2019s 2023 $1.5 million civil penalty assessed by the Federal Trade Commission for \u201cunauthorized disclosures of consumers\u2019 personal health information to Meta (NASDAQ:META), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and other companies.\u201d Taken in conjunction with the most recent lawsuit, GoodRx seems to consistently pull the wool over shareholders\u2019 eyes, Likewise, its past practice of actively \u201ccash[ing] in on consumers\u2019 extremely sensitive and personally identifiable health information\u201d is a clear violation of consumer trust, ultimately making GoodRx too risky for most portfolios and a strong candidate among stocks to sell.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) constantly faces lawsuits, the most well-known of which is the \u201cearplug lawsuit\u201d that found the company liable and compelled to pay a $6 billion personal injury settlement to affected parties. Beyond the pure payout, 3M is facing a $370 million legal defense bill \u2014 ultimately operating a money pit that\u2019s going to see shareholder value diverted toward legal costs rather than company growth, dividends, or buybacks.\n\nThat isn\u2019t all, of course. 3M also owes $10 billion to residents affected by the company\u2019s leeching \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in drinking water supplies. Payments toward this massive settlement begin next quarter and, as with the earplug suit, represent a company forced to focus on legal wrangling over operational expansion and dedicate capital toward payouts rather than benefiting shareholders.\n\nSurprisingly, 3M remained largely unaffected by the suits this year as shares have climbed 10% since January. This is due, in part, to an uncertainty principle: ongoing lawsuits have uncertain outcomes and create unknown risks for investors, whereas settlements and adjudicated suits have clearly defined costs that are more easily modeled. Still, with a slew of lawsuits in the rearview but likely more ahead, 3M is certainly a top contender among stocks to sell.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) isn\u2019t facing a lawsuit itself, but that doesn\u2019t detract from its risk and status among stocks to sell. Last month, investors filed suit against meme stock mega-star Keith Gill, who was originally a face of the movement that propelled GameStop to its massive highs and has recently reemerged as a major player. The litigants dissolved the suit earlier this month. Still, bad news of this type surrounding GameStop doesn\u2019t bode well for its future, particularly as the company itself remains on shaky ground with limited prospects beyond short-term meme stock status.\n\nThe company\u2019s cashing in on its recent bounce with a massively dilutive share offering is just one of many examples of management taking advantage of their unique position in the market; their position is understandable \u2014 may as well make hay while the sun shines \u2014 but also shows a clear disregard for the legions of current and future bagholders propping up the stock.\n\nI don\u2019t even need to get into GameStop\u2019s imminent operational concerns, which include job cuts amid slackening sales. If you made money on GameStop, congrats \u2014 but, if not, consider now the time to cut and run as GameStop sticks out like a sore thumb among stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "GameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) stock continued its decline last week, driven by fading meme stock momentum which was initially spurred by meme trader Keith Gill. GameStop stock dropped 3% to $24.18 by Friday\u2019s close. Gill\u2019s bullish views on GME previously sparked significant price increases in May and June.\n\nSince early June, Roaring Kitty scaled back on GameStop after boosting his holdings to 9 million shares and hosting his first livestream since 2021. As GME\u2019s price dropped, Gill appears to have turned his attention to other prospective stocks.\n\nNotably, Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) stock surged after the meme trader released a post featuring a dog cartoon, sparking trader interest. He later disclosed buying 9 million shares of Chewy to the SEC, influencing meme stock trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWill GME rebound this July? In my point of view, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nRoaring Kitty\u2019s Shift to Chewy\n\nKeith Gill surprised investors by shifting focus to Chewy, triggering a stock surge with a dog cartoon tweet. His SEC disclosure of 9 million Chewy shares raised questions about his long-term strategy, sparking speculation on portfolio diversification and a potential move away from GameStop.\n\nGill\u2019s influence on Chewy\u2019s rise underscores social media\u2019s power in meme stocks, highlighting their unpredictable nature.\n\nGameStop\u2019s stock struggled as it lost momentum from Gill\u2019s influencer-driven meme stock phenomenon. The recent decline underscores the reliance on ongoing influencer engagement for stock momentum, with Gill\u2019s absence affecting investor enthusiasm. Future performance hinges on Gill\u2019s potential return to active promotion.\n\nThere\u2019s Always the Potential for Future Litigation\n\nA recent lawsuit filed against Keith Gill alleging a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme with GME stock was swiftly withdrawn after filing. GameStop shareholder Martin Radev accused Gill of securities fraud in a proposed class action in Brooklyn federal court. However, Radev voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit in a court filing on Monday afternoon.\n\nRadev dropped the suit without explanation, and his lawyers have not responded to various inquiries on the matter. GameStop posts on X have resumed, along with Chewy posts, indicating the potential headwind for meme stocks is temporarily removed. The suit alleged Gill purchased 120,000 GameStop call options before a stock surge.\n\nOn June 2, Gill disclosed owning 5 million GameStop shares and 120,000 call options expiring on June 21. By June 13, his holdings increased to over 9 million shares after selling/exercising all options for profit, boosting his stake significantly.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop\u2019s shares, which closed around $23 on Monday, saw a rise less dramatic than the January 2021 frenzy, where it surged more than 1,700% amid a battle between retail investors and hedge funds.\n\nThe question is whether future litigation may arise, and if so, what that will mean for meme stocks across the board. Investors following any influencer into a stock for pure speculative purposes are taking on very high risk for very uncertain returns, and ought to be aware of the risks.\n\nGameStop Stock Isn\u2019t Worth It\n\nThere are now new meme stocks investors are clearly turning their attention to. Simply put, if the crowd shifts its focus away from GameStop (which it appears to be doing), there really isn\u2019t any case that can be made for speculators or investors to hold this stock.\n\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, GameStop\u2019s quarterly year-over-year sales drop of 30% in Q1 has to be worrying. There\u2019s little indication at this point in time that a turnaround is truly coming to fruition.\n\nWhile the company clearly has bolstered its cash position by selling shares into previous rallies, it\u2019s unclear whether the company can be good stewards of this capital and generate returns for investors moving forward.\n\nAccordingly, I think GameStop is simply a stock to be avoided. It\u2019s likely too risky a bet on the long or short side of the equation, so I\u2019m going to sit back, make some popcorn, and enjoy the fireworks from the sidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty Rally 3.0? 3 Meme Stocks Ready for Round Three",
        "content": "There\u2019s a lot of significance behind the timely return of investing influencer Keith Gill, who is best known by his YouTube and X persona, \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d Gill was a driving force behind the 2021 meme stock frenzy that saw GameStop\u2019s stock briefly soar 4,000% in a now infamous short squeeze.\u00a0Now, there are several meme stocks ready to go to the moon.\n\nThe events of January 2021 and the unlikely rise of GameStop inspired a new wave of meme investing off the back of a strong post-pandemic recovery on Wall Street that saw more retail investors coordinate to inflate the value of their favorite stocks based solely on sentiment.\n\nFollowing a hiatus of almost three years, Roaring Kitty\u2019s X account exploded with a flurry of activity in the form of cryptic meme-focused multimedia posts. With followers assuming Gill was focused on a GameStop revival, GME embarked on a Q2 2024 peak of around 306% before a harsh correction. The stock finished the quarter with growth of more than 105%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut what\u2019s so significant about Gill\u2019s return in 2024? Crucially, markets have embarked on a new wave of optimism that hasn\u2019t been seen since the time of the last meme stock rally in 2021. With expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, the S&P 500 has recovered its 2022 losses and sits in uncharted territory at 5,572 at the time of writing.\n\nThis makes conditions ideal for retail interest and the return of meme investing, and these three meme stocks could be the biggest beneficiaries should the Roaring Kitty rally 3.0 take place in the second half of 2024:\n\nGameStop (GME) Photo of the Gamestop (GME) logo On a Mobile Phone.\n\nSource: Shutterstock / mundissima\n\nThe reality of the matter is that no meme stock frenzy would be complete without GameStop (NYSE:GME), and a prospective Roaring Kitty rally 3.0 is highly unlikely to see GME remain static in the face of renewed retail interest.\n\nGameStop is by far the most popular meme stock on Wall Street today. From the beginning of Q2 2024 to the stock\u2019s peak during the quarter, GME had rallied 306.59%.\n\nAt this stage, it\u2019s important to highlight that there are problems related to the stock. This is natural in meme investing because struggling stocks make for the best short-squeeze opportunities.\n\nIn its Q1 2024 earnings, GameStop reported net sales were down to $882 million, a substantial decline from the $1.237 billion reported in the first quarter of the year prior and an illustration of the challenges the company has faced in the wake of declining consumer confidence.\n\nThe stock\u2019s biggest cheerleader, Gill, had also faced a lawsuit accusing the influencer of defrauding investors through a \u2018pump-and-dump\u2019 scheme in connection with his promotion of GameStop. However, the allegation has since been withdrawn.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite its hardships, GameStop remains the king of meme stocks and a draw for retail investors. The stock\u2019s meme credentials are likely to see GameStop remain front and center during any future meme stock revival.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the face of it, software firm Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) doesn\u2019t appear as an archetypical meme stock. The company is new, innovative, and operates on strong fundamentals. Meme stocks, however, have often taken the form of nostalgia-driven companies that have fallen on hard times. This makes them a target for a short squeeze.\n\nPalantir bucks this trend. The stock\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings were so good. In fact, the company reported a revenue increase of 21% year over year to $634 million.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Palantir reported revenue of $634 million. This marked a 21% increase year-over-year and surpassing the analyst estimates of $625.43 million. This growth is attributed to a robust performance in both the commercial and government sectors.\n\nThe stock has also consistently outperformed the wider market. It has grown by 52.77% in the first two quarters of 2024.\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp has helped to inspire retail investors to buy into PLTR after recognizing the potential of meme investing. Furthermore, the stock remains a popular option on Reddit boards today.\n\nIn terms of utilizing a company with strong fundamentals as a meme investment opportunity, there\u2019s perhaps no better option than Palantir.\n\nChewy (CHWY)  The Chewy logo on a banner at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nSource: Chie Inoue / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are no meme stock\u2019s more fascinating in 2024 right now than Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). Given the weird and wonderful world of meme investing, that\u2019s really saying something.\n\nChewy is an online pet food retailer. It entered Q3 2024 more than 77% adrift from its February 2021 all-time high value on Wall Street.\n\nSo, what\u2019s changed for CHWY? Roaring Kitty. Despite long adopting a sole focus on GameStop, it was revealed in recent weeks that Keith Gill had purchased over nine million Class A shares in Chewy. This represents a 6.6% stake in the company.\n\nWhy the interest in Chewy? GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen founded the pet food retailer, which is likely to have strengthened Gill\u2019s affinity with CHWY.\n\nGill\u2019s most recent post on X was simply a cartoon image of a dog. This may signify a change of tact for the world\u2019s most famous meme stock influencer. Is it enough to prompt a Chewy rally to the same meteoric highs as GameStop achieved in 2021? Only time will tell.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Chewy Stock (NYSE:CHWY): Volatility Creates Opportunity",
        "content": "Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), a leading pet products e-commerce business, has seen increased market volatility after Keith Gill, popularly known as Roaring Kitty on social media platforms, revealed a $245 million stake in the company recently. This volatility creates an opportunity for long-term-oriented investors.\n\nChewy stock surged 20% in pre-market trading last Monday before ending the day down nearly 7% as investors reacted to a lawsuit filed against Keith Gill. The lawsuit alleged that he has been involved in pump-and-dump schemes in the last couple of months, mainly involving GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares. Nonetheless, I am bullish on CHWY stock, as I believe the company still enjoys a long runway to grow.\n\nShort-Term Volatility Is Unavoidable\n\nRoaring Kitty, who reportedly profited more than $300 million by investing in GameStop during the original meme stock mania in 2021, usually invests in beaten-down, highly-shorted stocks. His $245 million investment in Chewy translates to a 6.6% ownership stake in the company, making him its third largest shareholder.\n\nWall Street analysts believe Roaring Kitty\u2019s investment in Chewy will substantially increase the volatility in Chewy stock. Mizuho Securities analyst David Bellinger noted that retail investor activity on several online platforms such as Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) and X has increased in the last few days, which points to increased volatility, as these investors are likely to trade in and out of Chewy based on technical indicators and Roaring Kitty\u2019s actions.\n\nCFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram, in a note to clients, wrote that investors should brace themselves for heightened volatility, as Chewy will be treated similarly to any other meme stock.\n\nProspects Look Bright\n\nChewy\u2019s revenue growth has decelerated in recent quarters after peaking during the pandemic when mobility restrictions helped the company get more sales. In Fiscal 2024, which ended in January, Chewy\u2019s revenue grew just 10% YoY, a significant slowdown from revenue growth of 37% and 47% reported in Fiscal 2020 and 2021, respectively. Looking at the long term, there is hope that growth will accelerate.\n\nChewy\u2019s revenue diversification efforts will fuel revenue growth in the coming years. Since launching CarePlus in 2021, the company has aggressively made inroads into the pet healthcare and insurance businesses. Chewy now offers total wellness packages for pets, comprehensive insurance plans, and accident-only insurance packages.\n\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global pet insurance market will grow at a CAGR of 14.5% through 2033, lifting the market value from $10.1 billion in 2023 to $38.3 billion by 2033. Chewy\u2019s strategic exposure to this sector, therefore, will help revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nChewy\u2019s expansion into the pet pharmacy business is also encouraging, given that the U.S. pet medication market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 6% through 2029. Last December, Chewy CEO Sumit Singh claimed that the company is on track to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue from the Pharmacy business. Pet owners are showing an increasing preference for uploading prescriptions to online pharmacy platforms to get medications delivered to their doorsteps.\n\nThe company now offers advertising solutions on its online platform as well, which allows businesses to advertise their products directly to Chewy\u2019s more than 20 million active user base. In the long run, this strategy will result in higher monetization levels of platform users.\n\nChewy\u2019s investments in building and maintaining automated fulfillment centers also paint a promising picture of the company\u2019s future. These automated fulfillment centers are likely to reduce the time it takes for the company to deliver products ordered by customers, which may lead to potential competitive advantages in the future.\n\nThe company is already offering same-day delivery services in select markets, and a national rollout of same-day delivery will help Chewy thwart the threat of increasing competition from well-established e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe Improving Financial Performance\n\nChewy\u2019s revenue growth has decelerated from pandemic highs, which does not come as a surprise, given how mobility restrictions in 2020 and 2021 led to a surge in demand for pet product delivery. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2025, revenue grew by just 3% YoY, in contrast to the double-digit growth the company registered in Fiscal 2021 and 2022. However, there are signs of a recovery.\n\nChewy\u2019s strategic decision to expand into the high-margin pet healthcare business is delivering promising results already, with its Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin hitting 5.7%, a notable improvement from just 3.1% in the previous quarter. The company positively revised adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for the full year by 40 basis points after reporting Q1 earnings, which is a clear sign that Chewy is beginning to benefit from its growing exposure to high-margin business sectors.\n\nIn Q1, pet spending per customer grew almost 10% YoY to $562, which indicates that Chewy has become the go-to pet care e-commerce retailer among its regular customers, even amid inflationary pressures. This customer stickiness could be an early sign of long-lasting competitive advantages.\n\nChewy\u2019s management is growing in confidence about the potential of the company to generate substantial free cash flows in the future, evident from the decision to repurchase $500 million worth of shares from Buddy Chester Sub LLC. Once the transaction is complete, the company will retire 17.55 million shares. Chewy, in the long run, is likely to reward shareholders handsomely with buybacks.\n\nIs Chewy Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nBased on the ratings of 23 Wall Street analysts, Chewy comes in as a Moderate Buy. The average CHWY stock price target is $26.23, which implies upside potential of just 8.3% from the current market price.\n\nThe improving financial performance and Chewy\u2019s aggressive expansion into new business verticals and markets should result in upward-trending price targets in the long term.\n\nThe Takeaway: Short-Term Volatility Needs to be Ignored\n\nIn my view, long-term-oriented investors should ignore the expected uptick in Chewy stock\u2019s volatility resulting from Roaring Kitty\u2019s investment in the company. Although Chewy may perform like a meme stock in the short run, long-term stock prices will be determined by the company\u2019s fundamentals, which are headed in the right direction.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Gaming Stocks to Sell in July Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "The world of gaming has never been so full of opportunity and uncertainty. For an industry that\u2019s expected to grow to a market value of $312 billion by 2027, many of its biggest players are still divided over how this growth will manifest itself.\n\nAlthough Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) 2022 acquisition of leading gaming firm Activision Blizzard was in part a metaverse play, the furor surrounding the metaverse has since calmed significantly. Despite this, we\u2019re seeing use cases for Web 3.0 gaming and the incorporation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies as a means of broadening the horizons of what video games can achieve for their players.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re also seeing plenty of barriers to the growth of gaming stocks. Growing competition has stunted the growth of some stocks, while uncertainty over the appropriate incorporation of generative AI has prompted a backlash among consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn a market that\u2019s so full of opportunities, there\u2019s still plenty of danger for the sustainability of the landscape\u2019s strongest stocks. With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at three gaming stocks that could be a screaming sell in a tumultuous industry:\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn an industry full of unconventional stocks, it\u2019s some achievement that GameStop (NYSE:GME) is perhaps the most famous gaming stock on Wall Street today.\n\nHowever, GameStop\u2019s popularity has virtually nothing to do with the video game retail company itself, and therein lies the problem for the future of the stock.\n\nGameStop has consistently been the focal point of meme stock rallies, ever since the globally renowned retail investing influencer Keith Gill, otherwise known as Roaring Kitty, decided to cheerlead for GME in the buildup to its 4,000% short squeeze in January 2021.\n\nWhile the stock has since consistently slid from its astronomical peak, Gill recently returned from a social media hiatus to inspire more retail investors to buy back into GME.\n\nAlthough GameStop\u2019s most passionate retail investors fiercely promote the \u2018diamond hands\u2019 mentality, it can be extremely difficult for individuals to hold their positions in stock without any fresh positive news to drive further outperformance. With this in mind, it\u2019s overwhelmingly likely that GME is destined to slide from its Q2 2024 highs over the rest of the year.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) There Doesn't Appear to Be a Clear Path Forward for EA Stock\n\nSource: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving spent almost 20 years as the uncontested market leader in soccer video game titles for consoles, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) appears set to face a brand new level of competition that could threaten the bottom line of the company at a challenging time for its dominance.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, EA\u2019s partnership with soccer governing body FIFA ended, prompting a reversion from its hugely successful FIFA series to EA Sports FC.\n\nWhile the game itself was largely unchanged in terms of content, the firm expected slower sales and Electronic Arts\u2019 Q1 2024 revenues of $1.78 billion saw a 5.1% year-on-year decline in line with analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nWorryingly, EA\u2019s former naming rights partner, FIFA, recently announced that it would be reviving the FIFA title with rival gaming studio 2K Sports.\n\nReports suggest that a rival soccer title could arrive as soon as this year, posing a fresh threat to EA\u2019s market dominance.\n\nFor Electronic Arts, facing a challenge to its dominance in the soccer market is a significant danger. In March 2021, during the peak of EA\u2019s partnership with FIFA, the game\u2019s Ultimate Team mode amassed $1.62 billion in extra content revenue alone from in-game purchases.\n\nShould 2K Sports eat into EA\u2019s market share, we\u2019re likely to see the Vancouver-based studio suffer in terms of its bottom line.\n\nHasbro (HAS) Hasbro (HAS stock) letters standing next to Magic the Gathering trading cards (a game from Hasbro)\n\nSource: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we get to look at a stock that could be set to struggle as a result of unease over the generative AI boom. Although Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) isn\u2019t directly implicated in the ongoing GenAI content storm, its subsidiary, Wizards of The Coast has struggled with repeated backlashes over its behavior.\n\nIn January 2024, Wizards of The Coast was caught using generative AI art to advertise its Magic: The Gathering trading card game only a matter of weeks after the company pledged to use human artists rather than artificial intelligence within its operations.\n\nAfter initially denying the use of AI, Wizards of The Coast ultimately admitted that the image was created with \u201csome AI components.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Wizards of The Coast began advertising for an AI engineer, prompting further scrutiny among consumers.\n\nDespite fears over falling sales, Hasbro outperformed its expectations in Q1 2024 earnings. However, commentators have suggested that the stronger-than-expected quarter has been down to the performance of gaming titles like Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 and a crossover between Fallout and Magic: The Gathering. Should the stock face further scrutiny in the future, it may find less support.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After two major meme-stock-driven gains in May and June, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has mostly been on the down and out. Having gained 48% year-to-date, it\u2019s hard to call the 2024 performance of GameStop stock a disaster. This time last year, it traded slightly lower than today.\n\nKeith Gill, the man behind the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d persona, used his notoriety surrounding the video game retailer\u2019s stock, to make a little money on GME, announcing on Reddit June 2 that he\u2019d made a $116 million bet on it. By June 6, they\u2019d doubled in price, to $46.55. By June 13, Gill had sold all 120,000 call options, making a sizable gain.\n\nNow, Gill has chosen to make a big bet on Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s original masterpiece.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn July 1, filed disclosure forms with the SEC, indicating that he\u2019d acquired a 6.6% stake in the online pet food retailer for $245 million. Its shares briefly jumped more than 10%. However, they closed July 3 trading, down nearly 12% from the stock\u2019s closing price on June 28, the day before Gill\u2019s announcement.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t have the time of day for GameStop stock, it\u2019s a better bet than Chewy.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nChewy Stock Down 36% in the Last Year\n\nOver the past year, Chewy is down over 36%, compared to a nearly 2% gain for GameStop. I\u2019m not surprised that GME is lapping the online retailer.\n\nGameStop is a company without a tangible plan to fix its failing brick-and-mortar retail business, while Chewy appears to be following e-commerce 101 to get its business remotely profitable. Yet the former is the stock with gains to show for it over the past year.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a fan of either stock.\n\nIn January, I wrote that even though it\u2019s been a public company for nearly five years, it\u2019s generated cumulative losses of $637 million, demonstrating an inability to consistently make a profit.\n\nWhile GameStop is hardly what you\u2019d call a money-making machine, its accumulated deficit is $245 million as of May 4, considerably less than Chewy\u2019s at $1.91 billion. Now, that can change in a hurry if either company experiences a surge in profits or losses in the coming quarters.\n\nThe point is, even though they both have trouble making money, Chewy, up until recent quarters, hasn\u2019t for a very long time. In fact, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, in the 2o quarters since going public in June 2019, it has generated an operating profit on six occasions, the most recent being Q1 2024, at $64.6 million.\n\nAs for GameStop, until Q2 2019, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, it made a profit in every quarter over the previous five years. Ryan Cohen came into the picture in August 2020.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line on GameStop Stock\n\nIn mid-June, I suggested Cohen should invest GameStop\u2019s $4 billion in cash in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK. B) and LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY), two hands off investments that would surely generate long-term returns for shareholders.\n\nAs much as I don\u2019t think Cohen knows what he\u2019s doing with GameStop, having $4 billion to invest at your disposal makes it a little easier to paper over the mistakes he\u2019s made since getting involved four years ago.\n\nFor example, Buckle (NYSE:BKE) is a Nebraska-based retailer that has a penchant for paying special dividends each year. In January, it paid a special divvy of $2.50. In the four years before that, it paid out $10.55, plus a quarterly regular dividend of between 30 cents and the current payment of 35 cents.\n\nWith an enterprise value of $1.87 billion, he could pay a 50% premium for its stock \u2014 CEO Daniel Hirschfeld owns 31.9% of the shares, so Cohen would need his blessing for the deal to get traction with the board \u2014 for a purchase price of $2.81 billion, and Cohen would still have nearly $1.2 billion to invest elsewhere.\n\nExcept for a $16.2 million operating loss in Q1 2020, Buckle has made a profit in every quarter over the past decade. It might not be \u201ccollectibles\u201d or \u201ccrypto\u201d splashy, but it does what both GameStop and Chewy can\u2019t, and that\u2019s consistently making money.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, GameStop is a better speculative buy than Chewy at this point in the proceedings.\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t buy either.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In that case, there\u2019s likely something wrong with it \u2014 while contrarian investing has its place, moving against the tide can be devastating.\n\nThese three stocks with negative analyst sentiment have an overwhelmingly bearish consensus and, therefore, aren\u2019t worth buying today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt likely isn\u2019t surprising that GameStop (NYSE:GME) tops the list of stocks with negative analyst sentiments. With the overwhelming majority of analysts saying that GameStop is a screaming sell, it seems the only bulls remaining in GameStop\u2019s corner are the legions of bagholders continually drawn in by empty promises of a short squeeze long past overdue.\n\nAnalyst consensus pegs GameStop\u2019s fair value at about $11 per share or more than half of today\u2019s trade price. Meme stock status aside, the reasons are apparent. Quarterly sales for 2024\u2019s first quarter failed to break the $1 billion mark, dropping nearly 30% on a year-over-year basis. GameStop improved its profitability prospects by $18.2 million to hit a net loss of $32.3 million. But, far from operational improvements, the narrower net loss is largely attributable to slashing SG&A expenses \u2014 which primarily came from sweeping layoffs.\n\nWedbush analysts are particularly bearish on GameStop, saying that the company has perhaps five years of cash available if current sales trends continue without a rapid turnaround.\n\nBoeing (BA) BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the clouds\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock\n\nLike GameStop, it isn\u2019t surprising that Boeing (NYSE:BA) is one of today\u2019s top stocks with negative analyst sentiment. By now, we\u2019re all too familiar with the multitude of aircraft and performance problems that sent shares tumbling 25% since January and keep the stock trading well below pre-pandemic levels. Worse yet, the problems are systemic and not likely correctable within a reasonable timeframe to pull it from the depths of stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Boeing\u2019s problems stem from managerial decisions emphasizing financial tricks and bean counting over mechanical engineering and safety. One reporter summed the situation up succinctly: \u201cBoeing, like many, many publicly traded companies in the country, put a premium on satisfying its shareholders\u201d and that \u201cthe results of that at the end of the day were inferior checks and balances inside the company, a culture that promoted short-term profitability over long-term quality.\u201d\n\nIn other words, a lack of foresight and emphasis on long-term sustainability may be the final nail in Boeing\u2019s coffin and a definitive contributor to its status among stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nUdemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) once appeared promising given the rise of remote learning platforms, but increased bearish sentiment situates it within the stocks with a negative analyst sentiment camp. In an era overflowing with free educational resources, getting customers to pay for courses they can easily access on platforms like YouTube or find in books is a tough challenge. Although Udemy boasts high-profile corporate clients such as AT&T (NYSE:T), larger companies are increasingly developing their own internal training programs, reducing the need for Udemy\u2019s offerings.\n\nUdemy\u2019s customer retention numbers highlight this misalignment. While the company reported a 12% increase in total customers and a 21% rise in recurring revenue last quarter, a deeper dive into the numbers reveals a troubling trend.\n\nUdemy experienced an 8% decline in net dollar retention, indicating a drop in how long customers stay with the service. More worrying is the 9% drop in large customer net dollar retention, which includes companies with over 1,000 employees. These figures suggest that companies aren\u2019t sticking with Udemy for the long haul once they fulfill their immediate needs.\n\nIn the fiercely competitive EdTech market, Udemy\u2019s difficulty in retaining customers and setting itself apart is a significant concern, making it clear why it\u2019s situated among other stocks with negative analyst sentiment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "GameStop (GME) Down 13% in a Month: How to Play the Meme Stock?",
        "content": "GameStop Corp. GME, a stock synonymous with the meme trading frenzy, has seen a substantial decline of nearly 13% in the past month. Currently trading well below its 52-week high of $64.83, achieved on May 14, 2024, the stock closed at $24.37 on Jul 3. This sharp drop has left many investors questioning the future of GameStop and how to navigate the unpredictable landscape of meme stock investments.\r\n\r\nGameStop's rise to fame as a meme stock was nothing short of spectacular. Fueled by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets, the stock saw unprecedented gains driven by short squeezes and social media hype. This frenzy turned GameStop into a symbol of the power of retail investors challenging traditional Wall Street norms. However, the 62.4% decline from its 52-week peak highlights the inherent volatility and risk associated with such stocks. AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC and BlackBerry BB also joined the meme stock rally.\n\nUnpacking the Stock's Recent Slide\n\nSeveral elements might have contributed to GameStop's recent downturn, including market corrections, shifting investor sentiment and broader economic uncertainties. As initial enthusiasm waned and trading volumes normalized, the stock retreated from its highs. Moreover, investor scrutiny intensified amid ongoing concerns about the company's strategic direction and ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving gaming industry landscape.\r\n\r\nCEO Ryan Cohen's efforts to streamline GameStop's operations by reducing its physical store footprint have met mixed reactions from investors. Despite Cohen's emphasis on the advantage of a stronger balance sheet bolstered by nearly $4 billion from recent share sales, questions remain regarding a comprehensive strategy to revitalize the business amid declining physical game sales.\r\n\r\nGameStop's first-quarter fiscal 2024 results painted a challenging picture, reflecting the impact of inflation and shifting consumer preferences in gaming. The company reported an adjusted loss of 12 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a 10-cent loss. Net sales for the quarter were $881.8 million, which fell short of the $900 million consensus estimate, reflecting a significant 28.7% year-over-year decline.\r\n\r\nSales across hardware, software and collectibles segments experienced declines of 30.4%, 29.1% and 20.9%, respectively, highlighting operational challenges amid industry shifts toward digitization.\r\n\r\nAs PCs and smartphones continue to capture market share in the gaming industry, GameStop's core business faces growing challenges. GameStop will need to adapt its business model more aggressively to weather the competition and reignite growth.\r\n\r\nWell, despite the recent decline in its stock price, GameStop continues to trade at a significant premium relative to its industry peers, as evidenced by its price-to-earnings ratio. The rich valuation reflects its status as a meme stock rather than its underlying fundamentals. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate points to revenue declines of 21.6% and 10.5% for the current and next fiscal year, respectively, indicating ongoing market skepticism about GameStop's prospects.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Game Might Just Not be Over for GameStop\n\nDespite these challenges, GameStop maintains a loyal following among retail investors, sustaining its status as a meme stock with significant community-driven trading activity. The influence of social media platforms remains a potent force in driving stock volatility, with figures like Keith Gill potentially shaping future investor sentiment. Keith Gill, famously recognized as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d revealed a 6.6% stake in Chewy CHWY, an online retailer specializing in pet products.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, GameStop has bolstered its financial position through recent capital raises, providing flexibility to pursue digital transformation initiatives. The company has successfully raised significant capital through recent stock offerings, securing $933 million from selling 45 million common shares and an additional $2.1 billion from another 75 million shares. This capital influx provides GameStop with the financial flexibility to explore new growth avenues and invest in its transition toward a more digital and e-commerce-focused business model.\r\n\r\nEfforts to enhance its online platform and expand digital sales channels could potentially rejuvenate investor confidence if successful in driving revenue growth. Collaborations with gaming studios and tech companies present avenues for diversification and market expansion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, technical indicators are supportive of GameStop's performance. The stock is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating robust upward momentum and price stability. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nWhat Should be Your Strategy?\n\nGameStop's journey as a meme stock reflects both the excitement and inherent risks. While the recent stock price decline underscores near-term challenges, the company's financial resilience and strategic initiatives offer potential pathways to recovery. Current stakeholders should consider GameStop's evolving business strategy and maintain their position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, while potential new investors should exercise restraint due to the stock\u2019s high volatility and speculative nature.

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) remains among the most volatile stocks in the market. Media attention on GameStop stock can be both beneficial and detrimental for investors.\n\nHigh borrow fee rates and significant volatility make this a very difficult stock to gauge in terms of where it will trade over any time frame.\n\nThe reality is that GameStop\u2019s fundamentals have gotten forgotten in this meme stock trading debacle.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s extremely high price-earnings ratio of roughly 300-times suggests investors are betting on quite the turnaround with this flailing bricks-and-mortar video game retailer.\n\nThese metrics come at a time when analysts are predicting growth should slow dramatically, with no profit likely to come this quarter.\n\nI\u2019m of the view that more downside is ahead, but at current levels, this is a dangerous stock to short. Here\u2019s why I think the party\u2019s likely over for speculators of all types in this name.\n\nGameStop Stock Rides Meme Stock Frenzy\n\nGameStop\u2019s Solana-based meme coin, GME, surged 17% in U.S. trading, trading at $0.008691 with a market cap of around $59 million. Trading volume rose 30%, indicating increased trader interest.\n\nWhenever a company moves into the crypto realm, that\u2019s typically a red flag of sorts, whether crypto enthusiasts want to admit it or not.\n\nWhile this meme coin has seen strong momentum over the past month, it\u2019s clear that the return of Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill) in early May influenced its recent performance, echoing notable spikes in GameStop stock.\n\nRoaring Kitty\u2019s recent social media post featuring a dog image sparked gains in pet-related stocks. GME joins WIF and BOME as a key player in the meme coin market, potentially surpassing competitors in June.\n\nWith a bullish trend, GameStop stock aims to break resistance at $0.0084, possibly reaching $0.01. Further increases could propel it to $0.1 or even $1 in future bullish cycles.\n\nThis meme token could certainly surge higher, and could potentially take retail investors\u2019 eyes off the stock market. If that\u2019s the case, the entire meme thesis around GME stock certainly could be further impaired.\n\nMore Gamble Than Investment\n\nI\u2019ve long thought hitting the blackjack tables may be a better investing strategy than buying GameStop stock, for various reasons.\n\nFor one, I think having a 48% chance of winning (playing perfectly) could be better odds than predicting where this stock goes over any period of time.\n\nAs far as a \u201crandom walk\u201d is concerned, this is a stock that certainly appears to move in a fashion that\u2019s more akin to cards coming out at a gaming table.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith over 40 years of trading experience, various expects believe GameStop stock remains among the most speculative investments in the market.\n\nThat\u2019s largely due to fundamentals. The company\u2019s first-quarter sales dropped 29% year over year, with a $32.3 million loss compared to $50.5 million previously.\n\nAnalysts predict continued losses for the next two fiscal years. The company maintains 4,169 stores globally, despite the retail shift to digital, leading to sustained pressure on profit margins.\n\nGameStop Stock is Seeing Deeper Drops\n\nGameStop has clearly remained popular among retail investors, but its financials leave much to be desired.\n\nIn Q1, GameStop reported a $32.3 million loss on $882 million revenue, down from a $50.5 million loss on $1.2 billion the previous year. Sales of hardware, software, and collectibles declined. Analyst Adam Crisafulli noted the figures were ugly but in line with earlier forecasts.\n\nGameStop\u2019s stock dropped 39% from $28.22, with trading paused over 15 times due to volatility.\n\nShares rose after Gill went on social media announcing his $116 million GME shares. 2023 net sales also declined from the previous years\u2019s $5.9 billion, reaching only $5.2 billion.\n\nI\u2019m Not Dipping My Toes In This Water\n\nThere are plenty of other options for speculators to get their risk on with in the market.\n\nMoving out the risk curve can take many forms. But in this market, speculating on meme stocks just doesn\u2019t seem like a solid move.\n\nI think both short sellers and bulls on this name are likely to get equally burned. It\u2019s just not a trade worth making, in my view.\n\nAccordingly, I\u2019ll be happily watching the mayhem from the sidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) may be in the business of selling video games, but it\u2019s been meme fun and games that have driven price action for GameStop stock for quite some time. Most recently, with the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d rallies that took shape during May and June.\n\nBut now, with Keith Gill, the man behind the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d persona is now in hot water for alleged stock manipulation. The famed meme trader crawled back into the woodwork.\n\nThis could mean an end to the recent series of meme waves that have helped to make GME a profitable trade. At least, for those who got the timing right.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOnce more, focus with GameStop could be shifting back to the company\u2019s fundamentals. Put simply, that\u2019s bad news for investors. With the company\u2019s underlying performance still getting worse, another round of big price declines may be just around the corner.\n\nGameStop Stock: \u2018Meme Mania\u2019 Fading Fast, Despite \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Lawsuit Dismissal\n\nTwo months back, the \u201creturn of Roaring Kitty\u201d took GME off the road to its \u201cgame over\u201d moment. Shares leapt back into the fast lane, resulting in an epic surge for the \u201cmeme king.\u201d\n\nAs detailed in one of our previous GameStop stock articles, the \u201cRoaring Kitty rallies\u201d of May and June sent GME back up to as much as $64.83 per share.\n\nAlongside providing an opportunity for traders to realize fast money profits, these waves of epic run-ups also enabled the company to seize the opportunity. How? By selling newly-issued shares into the market.\n\nSince the \u201cmeme waves,\u201d however, GameStop shares have pulled back. This month, and in the months ahead, shares could stay on a downward trajectory.\n\nYes, Keith \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d Gill has seemingly gotten out of hot water. A stock manipulation lawsuit filed against the trader getting voluntarily dismissed within hours of its announcement to the public.\n\nStill, this brief controversy could end up making it difficult for Gill to influence the market with subsequent social media posts. With many investors burned by buying in \u201cmeme waves\u201d too late, there may also be fewer players left to dabble in the aforementioned meme fun and games.\n\nTurnaround Optimism Fading as Well\n\nAlongside the possibility of \u201cmeme mania\u201d continuing to fade, there\u2019s something else brewing that may mean lower prices ahead for GameStop stock.\n\nThat would be the latest \u201cnews\u201d regarding GameStop\u2019s turnaround efforts. Ryan Cohen, who is both the company\u2019s CEO as well as its largest shareholder, is leading these efforts.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if investors remain very confident in a Cohen-led \u201cdigital transformation\u201d for the video game retailer.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Shrey Dua reported July 1, Cohen\u2019s latest X.com post, announcing GameStop\u2019s desire to hire some mobile app developers, isn\u2019t doing to much to re-raise expectations.\n\nAt least, based on the fact that GME declined by more than 5% following this post. Yes, the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d lawsuit likely played a larger role in sending GameStop lower earlier this week.\n\nStill, while not certain, Cohen\u2019s social media post may be further indication that GameStop remains far behind in its turnaround efforts.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s still primarily an unprofitable bricks and mortar retailer in the midst of a terminal decline.\n\nIn time, as the hope and hype surrounding shares keeps on dissipating, and the stock completely loses its \u201cmeme premium,\u201d a sudden drop to a valuation more is very much possible.\n\nThe Verdict: Stay on the Sidelines For Now\n\nWhen it comes to GameStop, or comeback contender, anything\u2019s possible. Who knows, with the $2.14 billion raised during the recent meme waves, perhaps GME could buy itself out of its current predicament.\n\nMaybe it will use this cash to acquire a faster-growing business with a more promising future.\n\nUntil then, however, there\u2019s no need to hold exposure to GME, simply on the hopes that the situation improves for the better.\n\nBarring another \u201cmeme wave,\u201d and barring GameStop announcing a game-changing acquisition, a side back to its lows, or to even lower prices, appears to be the cards.\n\nIn other words, downside risk of at least 57%. With this in mind, it\u2019s pretty clear that staying on the sidelines is your best course of action when it comes to GameStop stock.\n\nGameStop stock earns a C rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) is a video game retailer with serious problems but some stock traders are willing to overlook the company\u2019s issues. That\u2019s highly risky and I would compare buying\u00a0GameStop stock to gambling in a casino. And never forget, the odds are always stacked against you at a casino.\n\nSure, it was a cute story in 2021 when the financial media pitted meme stock traders against the big, bad short sellers. The joke isn\u2019t funny anymore, though, and it\u2019s not so cute when retail investors lose their hard-earned money. So, before you join the crusade and start following meme lords and stock pumpers, at least get the basic facts about GameStop\u2019s dire situation.\n\nGameStop: An Anachronism and a \u2018Dump Truck\u2019\n\nAs I see it, GameStop is a struggling business that is basically an anachronism. By that, I mean it\u2019s a relic of a past era in which young people frequently played console games that they rented or bought from physical stores.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSure, some people might still drive to a physical store to buy a console game but they\u2019re probably middle-aged like I am. Streaming and digital downloads are the modalities of choice for young gamers nowadays and that\u2019s problematic for GameStop.\n\nThis issue shows up in GameStop\u2019s results for the first fiscal quarter of 2024. The company reported a\u00a0$32.3 million net earnings loss\u00a0on just $882 million in sales.\n\nIt is also discouraging that GameStop\u00a0didn\u2019t hold a conference call after releasing the company\u2019s quarterly financial results. Furthermore, GameStop\u00a0sold 75 million shares in an at-the-market offering, which might raise questions about share-value dilution.\n\nTherefore, I can understand why retail expert and investor Jeff Macke would call GameStop a \u201cdump truck of a company.\u201d I won\u2019t use that particular phrase, as I don\u2019t want to diminish the importance and usefulness of dump trucks.\n\nDiminishing Returns From Meme Stocks\n\nKeith Gill, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d is famous for promoting meme stocks and especially GameStop\u00a0stock. Gill was recently identified as GameStop\u2019s fourth-largest shareholder, so he has a clear-cut motivation to encourage his followers to buy shares.\n\nTo put it bluntly, waiting around for Gill to rally the troops isn\u2019t a sensible investment strategy. It\u2019s the summertime now and low trading volumes can create extreme volatility.\n\nGameStop\u00a0stock is already volatile and it\u2019s irresponsible to expose your portfolio to such a high level of risk. Moreover, meme stock traders aren\u2019t getting the same share-price boosts that they did in 2021 \u2014 or even in mid-May when Gill resurfaced.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere is a recent example. On June 27, Gill posted a picture of a cartoon dog on X (formerly known as Twitter). He didn\u2019t include any text in the posting. He subsequently revealed a 6.6% stake in online petcare stock Chewy (NYSE:CHWY).\n\nAlthough its stock briefly spiked it ended the day in the red. As trading on Monday drew to a close, CHWY shares were down more than 5%. It appears Gill\u2019s influence isn\u2019t as strong as some followers might believe it is.\n\nGameStop Stock: Be Skeptical and Control Your Risk\n\nIs Gill really a \u201cpioneer,\u201d as one commentator called him? I encourage you to be skeptical and, most importantly, manage the risk level of your portfolio.\n\nGameStop\u2019s fundamentals certainly aren\u2019t ideal and the company\u2019s stores aren\u2019t popular gathering places as they once were. Besides, you\u2019re supposed to think for yourself instead of just following a meme guru\u2019s trades. Thus, in the interest of risk control and common sense, the best policy is to stay completely away from GameStop stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Last week, Tesla said that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nEV maker Tesla saw its shares gain around 6% on Monday, but was lower in premarket the following day, as investors look to its quarterly production and delivery report later on.\n\nWall Street brokerage Wells Fargo added the stock to its \"tactical ideas\" watch list ahead of the data, but kept it at an \"underweight\" rating as other companies close in on the EV market in key territories.\n\nChina's BYD (1211.HK), for example, said it had seen a 21% rise in second-quarter electric vehicle sales, selling 426,039 EVs in the April-June quarter, according to a Reuters report.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, Tesla said that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets fall as traders await eurozone inflation data\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall \u2014 11,688 trucks \u2014 which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMeta stock barely wobbled after news of new regulatory challenges in Europe, as the European Commission circled its wagons to implement new digital markets laws.\n\nThe Commission said Instagram's \"pay or consent\" advertising model, where users must either consent to personalised ads or pay to remove them, is in breach of its laws. The regulator said that the \"binary\" advertising choice does not comply with its Digital Markets Act.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nMeta is up for a fight, however, saying that its EU advertising model is compliant.\n\n\u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\n\nIf Meta is proved to be in breach of these laws, it faces a potential fine of up to 10% of its global revenue.\n\nChewy (CHWY)\n\nPet food retailer Chewy has been on a memestock-fueled rollercoaster this week, heading 6.6% lower on Monday in US trading hours after notorious trader Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty, disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a 6.6% stake in the company.\n\nThe stake in the company seemed like an endorsement, causing retail traders to pile in and send the stock 18% higher in premarket trading on Monday. But the stock price quickly crashed lower after market open. On Tuesday, it looks set to stage a slight recovery when the market opens, with stock up around 1.8% in premarket.\n\nRyan Cohen \u2014 CEO of GameStop (GME), another memestock \u2014 is also the Chewy founder.\n\nSainsbury's (SBRY.L)\n\nUK grocer Sainsbury's said it had seen \"sustained grocery momentum\" in its first quarter, despite poor weather conditions.\n\nThe chain reported a 3% rise in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to 22 June. This figure strips out the closure of its Argos business in Ireland.\n\nTotal grocery sales were 4.8% higher as the firm saw robust growth by volume. However, this was the slowest growth seen for many quarters as food inflation has fallen back significantly.\n\nEven with seemingly positive numbers, its stock price took a knock in early trade on Tuesday, down around 3.6% shortly after the open.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased with our market-beating grocery performance and the early progress we\u2019re making against our Next Level Sainsbury's plan,\" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's CEO. \"We\u2019ve been winning from competitors every month for 15 months, as more and more people are choosing Sainsbury's for their big weekly shop.\"\n\nRead more: Shop price inflation at lowest point since October 2021\n\nSainsbury\u2019s has been struggling to differentiate itself from rivals with stiff competition on price from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl while its premium ranges fall short of those on offer at Waitrose and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), noted Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor.\n\n\"Nonetheless Sainsbury\u2019s continues to make headway in growing its market share versus rivals with potential for further growth as inflation pressures subsides, a boost from the summer sun that has only recently appeared, and the excitement around the Euros,\" she said.\n\n\"Sainsbury\u2019s was able to keep its full-year guidance unchanged for underlying operating profit of \u00a31.01bn and \u00a31.06bn representing growth of between 5% and 10%.\"\n\nWatch: EV demand, investing in AI, jobs data: Asking for a Trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the biggest takeaways from Monday's trading session.</p>\\n<p>Car manufacturers like General Motors (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM\\\">GM</a>) and Ford (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F\\\">F</a>) have scaled back their electric vehicle production plans amid weaker consumer demand.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty\u2019s favorite meme stocks are tanking as the trader faces securities fraud claims over past social media posts",
        "content": "Meme stock king Keith Gill\u2014also known as Roaring Kitty\u2014seems to be losing his golden touch. Shares of the viral stock picker\u2019s newest target, the online pet retailer Chewy, fell more than 6.5% on Monday even after Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed his $245 million stake over the weekend. Chewy stock soared last Thursday after Gill simply posted a photo of a cartoon dog on social media, but they\u2019re now 6.6% below Wednesday\u2019s closing price. It was a similar story for Gill\u2019s favorite stock, GameStop, which saw its shares plunge 5.4% on Monday.\n\nThis comes as the meme stock king faces a lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York accusing him of committing securities fraud for a string of social media posts about GameStop.\n\nGill has made a name for himself by leading an army of retail traders into the unloved stocks of struggling companies in an effort to turn a quick profit. The goal of these meme stock traders, as they\u2019ve become known, is to lift the share prices of floundering stocks enough to spark a short squeeze against the (mostly) professional traders that have big bets out against them. Rising share prices force short-sellers\u2014those who\u2019ve borrowed shares in order to bet against a company\u2014to cover their positions by buying stock, thus forcing prices ever higher.\n\nThe short-squeeze tactic has proved incredibly effective over the past few years, at least in brief bursts, but the rallying cry behind the meme stock trend is slowly waning.\n\nGill was able to marshall thousands of retail traders to follow him into stocks like GameStop during the pandemic based on the idea that they were profiting off the misery of Wall Street short-sellers. Many meme stock traders made a central villain out of Citadel founder and CEO Ken Griffin when surging prices of key meme stocks led some brokerages to pause trading because of extreme volatility in 2021. Citadel, a market maker, was even hit with a lawsuit at the time alleging that it colluded with brokerages to pause trading, but a U.S. district judge threw it out shortly after, citing lack of evidence.\n\nNow, with the retail vs. Wall Street narrative fading, Gill\u2019s ability to drive big moves in struggling stocks may be heading down a similar path. Of course meme stocks\u2019 underperformance this year likely has multiple causes: The additional pressure of higher interest rates, the ailing financials of GameStop and other meme stock favorites, and the cooling of the U.S. economy and thus consumers\u2019 willingness to invest in risky stocks could all be to blame.\n\nThe slowing of the meme stock trend could also be merely a temporary setback. The good news for Gill\u2019s loyal fans is the latest lawsuit against the meme stock king is likely dead on arrival, at least according to Eric Rosen, a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor who works at the law firm Dynamis.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe plaintiff in the case, Martin Radev, alleges that Gill operated a \u201cpump and dump\u201d scheme that caused him material losses in May. This is when a fraudster attempts to artificially inflate a stock\u2019s price for a short-term gain knowing that the information they\u2019ve shared to do so is false.\n\nBut Rosen explained in a June 28 article that this complaint is likely \u201cdoomed\u201d for several key reasons. For one, the plaintiff would need to prove that he purchased GameStop\u2019s stock based on false statements made by Gill. That\u2019s difficult when the post the lawsuit is mainly based on is a meme of a man leaning forward to look at a TV.\n\n\u201cThe tweets can hardly be described as false. Rather, posting a meme of a guy thinking about GME is not even a fact that can be proven or disproven,\u201d Rosen argued.\n\nPomerantz LLP, the law firm representing Martin Radev, did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment. Gill did not immediately respond to an X message seeking comment.\n\nAnother important issue the plaintiff will need to overcome is the \u201creasonable investor\u201d standard. In order to prove that the plaintiff was injured by Gill\u2019s social media posts that boosted GameStop\u2019s share prices (prior to a big drop), the prosecution will need to provide evidence that a reasonable investor would see Gill\u2019s picture of a man leaning forward as investment advice. But Rosen argued that a social media post is clearly \u201cnot material to reasonable investors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the plaintiff here sought to profit simply because Gill tweeted, not because of the content of the tweets,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe tweets of a meme stock icon were not something that a \u2018reasonable investor\u2019\u2014one who reads earnings reports and analyzes company news\u2014would take into account when making a decision.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff will also need to prove that Gill both failed to disclose his intent to sell, and was required to disclose his intentions.\n\n\u201cThey need to show that Roaring Kitty had a duty to disclose his intent to sell. And this is a high barrier. Generally, only financial advisors or fiduciaries have to disclose their positions or intent or things of that ilk,\u201d Rosen noted.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "'Roaring Kitty' is sued for alleged GameStop manipulation",
        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Keith Gill, the investor known as \"Roaring Kitty\" who helped spur the meme stock mania of 2021, was sued by GameStop investors who said they lost money through his \"pump-and-dump\" scheme for the videogame retailer.\n\nA proposed class action accusing Gill of securities fraud was filed on Friday in the Brooklyn, New York federal court.\n\nInvestors led by Martin Radev, who lives in the Las Vegas area, said Gill manipulated GameStop securities between May 13 and June 13 by quietly accumulating large quantities of stock and call options, and then dumping some holdings after emerging from a three-year social media hiatus.\n\nThey said Gill's activities caused GameStop's share price to gyrate wildly, generating \"millions of dollars\" in profit for him at their expense.\n\n\"Defendant still enjoys celebrity status and commands a following of millions through his social media accounts,\" the complaint said. \"Accordingly, Defendant was well aware of his ability to manipulate the market for GameStop securities, as well as the benefits he could reap.\"\n\nGill did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nHe had on May 12 posted a cryptic meme on the social media platform X that was widely seen as a bullish signal for GameStop, whose stock he cheerleaded in 2021.\n\nGameStop's share price more than tripled over the next two days, but gave back nearly all the gains by May 24.\n\nOn June 2, Gill revealed that he owned 5 million GameStop shares and 120,000 call options, and on June 13 revealed he had shed the call options but owned 9 million GameStop shares.\n\nInvestors said the truth about Gill's investing became known on June 3 when the Wall Street Journal wrote about the timing of his options trades and said the online brokerage E*Trade considered kicking him off its platform.\n\nThe meme stock mania was fueled in part by investors stuck at home during the pandemic, and led to a \"short squeeze\" that caused losses for hedge funds betting stock prices would fall.\n\nOn Monday, trading in Chewy shares became volatile after Gill revealed a 6.6% stake in the pet products retailer.\n\nThe case is Radev v. Gill, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 24-04608.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Holmes)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Could Chewy pick up a second meme stock pied piper?",
        "content": "In the days and weeks before Keith Gill's (aka Roaring Kitty) 6.6% stake in Chewy Inc (NYSE:CHWY) was revealed Monday, speculators were betting another major meme stock player would be a big buyer of the stock: Ryan Cohen.\n\nThoughts centered around Mr. Cohen's using GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), where he is Chairman and CEO, to buy shares of the online pet supply retailer. Notably, on December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors of GameStop approved a new investment policy that permits the Company to invest in equity securities, among other investments. This provides Cohen the flexibility to invest directly in companies like Chewy.\n\nIn addition, GameStop has a pocket full of cash that investors are clamoring for the company to put into play. Since May, GameStop has raised over $3 billion from stock sales through \"at-the-market\" equity offering programs, helped in part by a new phase of the meme stock craze first witnessed in 2021.\n\nCohen is no stranger to Chewy. He founded the company in 2011 and was its CEO until 2018. Chewy was sold to BC Partners/PetSmart for $3.35 billion in 2017 and went public again in 2019.\n\nIt is possible that Roaring Kitty's play on Chewy is to preempt GameStop's buying of the stock and help create one of his famous short squeezes. He is a top 5 holder at both companies, although investors question whether he is getting some private backing.\n\nIf Cohen were to use GameStop to buy shares of Chewy, one prominent player would stand in the way\u2014BC Partners. The private equity firm continues to own the vast majority of Chewy's stock, although it has been selling it down. In fact, traders believe the recent weakness in the stock is related to BC Partners' selling. Notably, the P/E firm sold more than $660 million in stock on June 26 and 27th, with Chewy buying back $500 million of the stock sold.\n\nWhether Cohen is buying Chewy stock remains to be seen. However, analysts expect volatility to reign supreme in the stock over the near term.\n\n\"Investors should brace for a period of extended volatility, even if meme stock trades don't have the same momentum as the GameStop saga back in 2021,\" CFRA analysts commented after today's Gill filing. \"There are a few similarities between GME and CHWY, including ties to Ryan Cohen and high short interest. However, a stark difference between the two companies is the fundamental tailwind behind CHWY, noting the company recently hit an inflection point in terms of profits and free cash flow.\"\n\nThe analyst added that the short interest as a percentage of the float is about 15%. However, the short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding is about 5%, as only about one-third of Chewy's 436M shares outstanding are free floating. The analyst rates shares a Hold with a $23 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop has not responded to requests to comment on rumors that it would buy Chewy stock, and Chewy has not responded to requests to comment about the Roaring Kitty stake or the rumored Cohen stake.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCould Chewy pick up a second meme stock pied piper?\n\nNorthern Data considers AI unit US IPO at up to $16 billion, Bloomberg News reports\n\nMississippi law restricting children's social media use blocked\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Shares of Chewy were volatile at the opening bell Monday after a regulatory filing revealed that Roaring Kitty, an investor at the center of the meme stock craze, has taken a 6.6% stake in the online pet retailer.\n\nRoaring Kitty, whose legal name is Keith Gill, bought more than 9 million shares of Chewy last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows. Based on Friday's $29.05 closing price, that amounts to a value of over $261 million \u2014 making him the company's third-largest shareholder.\n\nShares jumped more than 20% before the opening bell. After rising 5% when markets opened, shares of Chewy Inc. slipped 3%.\n\nChewy, based in Florida, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nGill tipped his hand last week on his feelings about the company, posting a picture of a dog on social media platform X and sending Chewy's stock up more than 30% in intraday trading.\n\nGill made a name for himself back in 2021, when he rallied retail investors around GameStop. At the time, the video game retailer was struggling to survive \u2014 and big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock. But Gill and those who agreed with him changed GameStop's trajectory by buying up thousands of shares in the face of almost any accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble.\n\nThat began what is known as a \u201cshort squeeze,\u201d when those big investors that had bet against GameStop were forced to buy its rapidly rising stock to offset their massive losses.\n\nGameStop saw yet another rally in May \u2014 when Gill returned online for the first time in three years.\n\nGill said he had faith in the ability of GameStop's Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen to modernize the company after what he did at Chewy. Cohen co-founded Chewy back in 2011. He stepped down from his role of Chewy's CEO in 2018.\n\nView comments",

The account posted a cryptic photo of a dog at 1 p.m. ET, sending the stock surging before it eventually lost gains and closed below the flat line.\n\nWhy Gill is interested in Chewy is largely unknown. Gill talked glowingly about current GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who is also the founder of Chewy, during a live stream on June 7 but hasn't made direct comments about the petcare provider. Notably, Cohen is no longer on the executive board at Chewy.\n\nGill's filing also provided little clues. Outside, of listing how many shares Gill owns, the 13-G filing provided one other detail. Gill included a box that asks to check the appropriate box for whether or not the filer is, or is not, a cat.\n\nGill checked the box labeled \"I am not cat.\" In Gill's 13G filing he included a box to identify whether or not he is a cat.

        "content": "When Keith Gill\u2014aka Roaring Kitty\u2014burst onto the GameStop scene over three years ago to lead an army of Reddit users against hedge fund billionaires on Wall Street, the captivating underdog story left audiences wanting more.\n\nEight months after his story was immortalized on the silver screen, his sudden return now threatens to play out like a bad Hollywood sequel\u2014banking on nostalgia while lacking any of the original drama and heroism the second time around. Worse, there\u2019s no real villain to fill the shoes of Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin\u2014and now the main protagonist has gone missing.\n\nWithout a narrative compelling enough to go viral, the chances that Gill can marshal his scattered forces and send GameStop shares to the moon again appear to be between slim and none.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the new story is for this company that would in any way justify the $9 billion valuation,\u201d argues Derek Horstmeyer, a professor of finance at George Mason University\u2019s School of Business in Virginia. \u201cAnd Gill didn\u2019t seem to be able to articulate what that would be either.\u201d\n\nwaiting for Roaring Kitty to post a GameStop PnL screenshot. pic.twitter.com/GGitUlMbKt\n\n\u2014 wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) June 20, 2024\n\nSince euphoria upon Roaring Kitty's reappearance propelled the stock as high as $48 earlier this month, it has relinquished almost all of its gains. Now it\u2019s trading around the $25 mark, only slightly above the $23.14 close before Gill\u00a0first revealed on June 2 that he owned 5 million shares.\n\nRoaring Kitty a creature of the lockdown-era zeitgeist\n\nAt the time GameStop first became a viral phenomenon, the 38-year-old portrayed it as nothing more than a YOLO trade\u2014a kind of \"get rich big or die trying\" mentality that analyst and podcaster\u00a0Demetri Kofinas has taken to calling \u201cfinancial nihilism\u201d.\n\nGill even claimed his investment decisions can lack any rhyme or reason and simply result from drawing random cards out of an Uno deck he keeps handy while consulting his Magic Eight Ball.\n\nIn that sense, Roaring Kitty was truly a creature of the zeitgeist. At the time, asset prices across the board were artificially inflated by a mixture of zero interest rates and quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. Pandemic-era stimulus checks put found money in the pockets of everyday Americans at a time when gambling on sports was impossible after COVID eliminated spectator events.\n\nStory continues\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQBubLv49fk\n\nMany discovered they could find all sorts of long shot bets offering a big payout with relatively little money in the options market, which enjoyed one crucial advantage over wagering on the ponies or a heavyweight title fight.\n\n\u201cIn sports betting, the more people pile in, the more the odds begin to even up without any effect on the likelihood of the outcome,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told\u00a0Fortune. But, \u201cif enough speculators buy a particular option at the same time, the greater the chances are that it pays off.\u201d\n\nTrapped at home and seeking community online, a number of small shareholders discovered wealthy hedge funds like Steve Cohen\u2019s\u00a0Point72 were all heavily short GameStop. Were Gill and his allies to gang together and buy short-dated call options from the likes of Citadel, it would send Ken Griffin\u2019s industry leading market maker and others like it scrambling to secure the underlying shares in order to cover their exposure. The Cohens and Griffins of the world would be tripping over each other bidding up the stock no matter the price.\n\nThe time was ripe for a GameStop run, too, since the retailer expected to profit from a lockdown-induced boom in video gaming matched with the launch of a new generation of Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox consoles.\n\nAlong with other social media users on the WallStreetBets subbredit, Gill helped catapult the stock to a split-adjusted intraday record of $120.75 in January 2021. The short squeeze that saw its market cap soar to $50 billion was so epic it caught the attention of the\u00a0White House. A month later Congress held a hearing over it with Gill providing testimony.\n\nMeme stock craze gives way to return to normalcy\n\nFour years later, the story is completely different. The pandemic is over, people are gradually returning to the office and policy tightening by an inflation-fighting Fed means savers are no longer penalized for socking their cash away in money market accounts.\n\nThe games industry is in an outright crisis with Sony, the dominant console manufacturer, admitting sales of its PS5 have\u00a0peaked. Games publishers are shutting down even successful studios and moving away from physical discs that cost money to manufacture and distribute in favor of remote downloads that leave GameStop one business model shy of a future.\n\nThe shared sense of community among fellow \u201capes\u201d, a self-deprecating term used by meme stock traders, is no longer as potent either. All that is left is a residual anger at a system rigged against them.\n\nWaiting for Roaring Kitty to post an update to his GameStop $GME holdings pic.twitter.com/qPjkuBekWr\n\n\u2014 wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) June 21, 2024\n\nWhether it\u2019s Nancy Pelosi\u2019s mysterious luck at stock picking that prompted calls to\u00a0ban Congress members trading, the SEC granting Warren Buffett exemption from disclosing his near $7 billion investment in a rival, or hedge funds simply being invited by the media to talk their book all the time, it often feels like the elites can get away with everything.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to crystallize the kind of support needed for a pile-on against bystanders not directly involved in GameStop. Neither Pelosi or Buffett make for convincing enough substitutes for billionaires like Cohen and Griffin, who many believe\u00a0pulled strings to get stock trading app Robinhood to pause activity when the market moved against them.\n\n\u201cKen Griffin made for a really great villain. GameStop traders really wanted to stick it to Citadel,\u201d Horstmeyer says.\n\nThe vitriol was so intense Steve Cohen\u00a0left Twitter due to threats he claimed were made against his family. This time around there\u2019s no prized scalp worthy of claiming, and latent anti-establishment sentiment is far more amorphous. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one concrete face to it,\u201d Horstmeyer adds.\n\nWhat's his strategy?\n\nIf Gill had any ideas how GameStop should reorganize, he hasn\u2019t expressed them since his return. He mainly communicates via guerilla-style memes (merely posting a\u00a0cartoon dog on social media sent shares in pet supplies retailer Chewy soaring on Thursday).\n\nThe one time he actually spoke to his fans, he hosted a rambling hour-long livestream on YouTube where he merely aimed to \u201creiterate a lot my viewpoints I had previously\u201d rather than update his thesis in light of recent events.\n\nFor now, Gill is keeping everyone guessing about his ultimate intentions. At one point he teased viewers on his sole livestream by pulling out his old trusty Magic Eight Ball to ask what the plan is for GameStop\u2014only to shelve it before the round plastic oracle could reply.\n\n\u201cEither he really does believe in this company, or he\u2019s totally nihilistic and just wants to be internet famous,\u201d Horstmeyer continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a toss-up at this point.\u201d\n\nThere is one new possible twist in the story no one had seen coming: as the company\u2019s second largest individual shareholder, Gill could demand a seat on the board. He seemed to send a\u00a0hidden message by raising his holding to the exact same number chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen had when he made a play.\n\npic.twitter.com/wGdvs6xF7w\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) June 10, 2024\n\nGill\u2019s last E*Trade post showed he\u2019s up $50 million, but that\u2019s small fry after\u00a0briefly being within reach of becoming a billionaire hours before he turned 38 this month. Still\u2014unless he gambles everything away\u2014he looks to be set for life even with \u2018just\u2019 $270 million in his E*Trade account. Can Gill, who spent much of the 2010s between jobs, credibly embody the same underdog in GameStop\u2019s \u2018us versus them\u2019 narrative?\n\n\u201cMy question is who is now the \u2018them\u2019?\u201d asks Sosnick. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure who \u2018them\u2019 is, \u2018them\u2019 is probably you.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the protagonist himself seems to have gone missing in his own story. WallStreetBets, the social media account that elevated the concept of meme stocks, YOLO trades and loss porn, sounded like a jilted lover this past week. After preaching to its followers that GameStop\u2019s \u2018mother of all short squeezes\u2019 was coming any day now, WallStreetBets turned to obsessively posting about Gill.\n\n\u201cWaiting for Roaring Kitty to post a GameStop PnL screenshot,itposted last Thursday, using the sad Pablo Escobar meme from Narcos. 24 hours later it followed with another appeal: \u201cNeed Roaring Kitty to give us a sign right now.\u201d On Monday it pleaded for Gill to \u201cdrop a banger tweet\u201d before finally complaining that a fortnight had passed without word from the totemic leader.\n\nGameStop has more money than it knows what to do with\n\nRight now the only one truly sitting pretty is GameStop itself. Capitalizing on the sudden renewed interest in Roaring Kitty, it\u00a0flooded the market with 120 million newly minted shares, diluting everyone including CEO Ryan Cohen, its largest shareholder. Thanks to the two issues, cash on hand quadrupled while its balance sheet doubled in size over the span of four short weeks.\n\nCitron is no longer short $GME. It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders. Despite Wedbush setting an $11 target today, we respect the\u2026\n\n\u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) June 12, 2024\n\nThe company filled its coffers so full that Andrew Left of Citron Research raised the white flag and exited his short. He argued the company is still a basket case but it could survive alone on the back of its cash pile even if its core business implodes. \u201cWith $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,\u201d Left\u2019s firm said.\n\nGameStop could now achieve profitability by simply investing in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries rather than selling actual video games, making it the equivalent of a Ryan Cohen family office with a captive brick-and-mortar retail business.\n\nEven the company doesn\u2019t seem to have plans about what to do with all the money now in its bank account. The annual shareholder meeting lasted just a half hour and no questions were taken from investors.\n\nUnless something unexpected happens that can capture people's imagination and galvanize support, social media will not prove as effective at rallying enough troops to sustain a run in GameStop shares this time around.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a sequel with no plot,\u201d says Sosnick.\n\nWith Gill seemingly on the sidelines for now, maybe he can loan out Cohen his trusty Magic Eight Ball.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "From Pump to Dump: 3 Meme Stocks Headed for a Massive Crash",
        "content": "Meme stocks are some of the most dangerous investments to make right now. In my view, now may be a good time to sell many top meme stocks that have gone on big runs. Of course, investors can always put some \u201cfun money\u201d into these stocks as high-risk gambles. However, I would not recommend chasing the current meme stock rally. Most meme stocks have legacy underlying businesses that are bleeding cash and have negative growth. These companies are unlikely to provide long-term returns. In fact, they\u2019re more likely to dilute investors toward oblivion.\n\nThe recent roaring kitty-led hype cycle around many meme stocks has led to a sharp rally over the past few months. Some stocks have seen incredible gains, so I think it is the perfect time to trim positions, for those holding these names. Of course, the hype could continue. But I think most of the hype is likely dead, and will continue to die down in the coming months.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) operates a chain of video game and entertainment stores. The company\u2019s latest earnings release paints a grim picture for this meme stock darling. I\u2019ve been skeptical about the GameStop craze since its inception. Speculators, flush with stimulus checks back in 2021 (and the likes of Roaring Kitty and others prompting speculators to consider certain stocks) led to unsustainable valuations which proved to be too good to be true.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYes, GME stock is up an eye-popping 130% since the start of May, but it still hasn\u2019t managed to overtake its previous high due to excessive share dilution. While the retail trading frenzy has allowed GameStop to raise a boatload of cash, I believe now is the perfect time to take profits and run for the hills.\n\nGameStop\u2019s financials are simply too poor to justify its premium. The company is also closing many more stores than it is opening. Meme stocks to sell: GME stores opened/closed\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nNet sales plunged from $1.237 billion in Q1 2023 to a mere $882 million in Q1 2024. The company also remains deeply unprofitable, posting a net loss of $32.3 million on this revenue. Trading at an absurd 2.5-times forward sales, GameStop\u2019s valuation is completely detached from reality, given its lack of growth and widening losses. The cash raised from the meme stock rally may provide some temporary relief. But throwing money at a sinking ship is never a wise investment strategy. Further pumps will also likely be met with even more dilution. As such, I think it is one of the top meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The logo for AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC) is displayed above a movie theater entrance.\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is a massive movie theater chain operator, with a significant following. However, I believe this legacy business model is destined for decline. In its first quarter, AMC managed to broadly maintain revenues despite a drop in box office sales. However, I don\u2019t see this as a sustainable trend, given the relentless rise of streaming competitors.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated shifts in consumer behavior, with younger generations heavily favoring online entertainment options. Some studios are already experimenting with simultaneous streaming and theatrical releases. This could rapidly erode the viability of cinemas if it becomes the norm.\n\nAMC has improved its efficiency, though. Plus, higher per-patron revenues are commendable. That said, I view these tailwinds negatively, as I think they\u2019re just prolonging the inevitable. The company may survive in the near term as interest rates stabilize. But I believe AMC has very limited long-term growth potential in the face of digital disruption.\n\nAs streaming services become ever more dominant, physical movie-going will likely continue to dwindle. In my view, AMC is another meme stock that investors should consider selling before this small ongoing pump turns into a painful dump.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE:BB) provides cybersecurity solutions and Internet of Things (IoT) software. Indeed, while the days of BBM and \u201cCrackBerries\u201d are long gone, the company recently delivered a solid revenue beat this quarter, with both its IoT and cybersecurity divisions exceeding expectations. However, I believe this momentary uptick is unlikely to lead to a genuine turnaround for the struggling legacy tech player.\n\nWhile BlackBerry achieved its third straight quarter of improved cash flow and narrowed losses, the bar was set exceedingly low, given the company\u2019s multi-year decline. BlackBerry\u2019s $144 million in revenue still represents a staggering 61.4% plunge compared to the prior year. I\u2019m not convinced that eking out a modest revenue beat against the backdrop of such a dramatic collapse should be cheered.\n\nCEO John Giamatteo claims BlackBerry\u2019s strategy is working, but where\u2019s the proof? The company continues to bleed red ink with a 3 cent per share loss, and its vaunted IoT business saw a sequential drop in development seat revenue. Unless BlackBerry stems its chronic customer attrition and returns to profitability soon, this meme-propelled dead cat bounce will likely end in tears for retail bulls. In my view, BB stock is definitely one of the top meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Petco Health & Wellness Co.) Perhaps PET? (Wag! Group Co.) Or, quite possibly, the company that was co-founded by Ryan Cohen, GameStop Corp.\u2019s current chief executive, CHWY? (Chewy Inc.)\n\nHis legions of retail traders \u2014 tracking @TheRoaringKitty on X and u/DeepF\u2014\u2014ingValue on Reddit \u2014 didn\u2019t wait to find out. Each stock jumped by at least 12% after the dog post, triggering trading halts that in pre-meme years were usually reserved for merger news or management changes.\n\nMuch like when Gill renewed a bout of GameStop fever with a photo of a gamer leaning in with his controller, the episode has longtime market observers on edge about the influence of a retail-trading ringleader with the power to bend markets, for potentially their own personal gain. It\u2019s one thing when there\u2019s obvious falsehoods or misrepresentations, but how, they wonder, could authorities ever fault someone for what Redditors or bots read into a meme?\n\nOr, to put it bluntly: Who does this guy \u2014 and the traders who track him \u2014 think he is, exactly?\n\n\u201cCrypto folks are probably laughing at the equity market.

While Gill has long made a fundamental case for GameStop, it\u2019s less clear how to interpret his potential foray into pet companies.\n\nRicher Memelord\n\nSure, Elon Musk, a fellow memelord, can sway the price of dogecoin with a mere mention on Saturday Night Live, or roil shares of Tesla Inc. by putting up a poll about selling a chunk of his stake. But with a fortune in excess of $200 billion, and with a handful of interconnected companies in his control, he has the financial might to shift markets.\n\nGill though? He earned a CFA charter and was previously employed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., in effectively an unremarkable office job. Yet, in the meme-stock era he helped usher in, he\u2019s built up a sizeable fortune by all accounts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe latest market moves suggest at least some Roaring Kitty fatigue is kicking in. Petco shares closed little changed on Thursday, and ended the week just 6.8% higher than where they started. Wag! Group, after at one point on Thursday notching its biggest daily gain in 10 months, fell 4.2% on Friday. Chewy, which nearly hit a one-year high on Tuesday, closed out the week by falling 6.2%.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear his impact is becoming shorter- and shorter-lived with Chewy down since the dog meme from yesterday,\u201d said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. \u201cThe more the trading community sees the Roaring Kitty story play out (tweet, stock spike, stock crash), the shorter the time frame becomes for each interaction.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which the pet-related shares rallied \u2014 and then reversed \u2014 raises questions about the traders who are heeding Gill\u2019s purported populist call more than three years ago. Back then, he and a group of Redditors famously wreaked havoc on short-selling hedge funds and provided a windfall for the retail crowd.\n\nThat celebration didn\u2019t last long. When the risk-on spirits took a U-turn in 2022, amateur traders gave back all of the meme-era gains within months, Morgan Stanley\u2019s analysis at a time showed.\n\n\u201cIf hedge funds aggressively short Chewy, GameStop and other meme stocks, you\u2019re essentially trading against an 800 pound gorilla,\u201d said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president and adviser at Wealthspire Advisors. \u201cIf you\u2019re betting on this with your retirement money, I\u2019ll say a prayer for you and wish you well.\u201d\n\nThe fact that there\u2019s appetite to ride volatile meme stocks has caught some onlookers by surprise, given the different economic backdrop from its original fervor in 2021. The pandemic excess savings buffer is depleted and then some, helping drive a decline in consumer firepower.\n\nBut, at least in the US market, there appears to be plenty of ammunition to lift broad indexes \u2014 and, at least for a moment, the Roaring Kitty stock of the day.\n\n\u201cThe fervor to speculate is still very much alive,\u201d Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, said on Bloomberg Radio. \u201cPeople are still ready to gamble on the stock market as if the pandemic just hit the shores. It again shows you that there\u2019s a great big willingness to take risk.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Emily Graffeo, Carmen Reinicke and Stefani Reynolds.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan\u2019s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back The FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search GameStop Corp. (GME): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "GameStop (GME) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this video game retailer have returned +11% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Gaming industry, to which GameStop belongs, has gained 16.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, GameStop is expected to post a loss of $0.01 per share, indicating a change of +66.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +80% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.08 points to a change of +33.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +700%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.02 indicates a change of -75% from what GameStop is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -77.8%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for GameStop.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GME _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of GameStop, the consensus sales estimate of $900 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -22.7%. The $4.13 billion and $3.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and -10.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $881.8 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.7%. EPS of -$0.12 for the same period compares with -$0.14 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $900 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.02%. The EPS surprise was -20%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, GameStop surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGameStop is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GameStop. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Specialty Retail Stocks Q1 Teardown: GameStop (NYSE:GME) Vs The Rest\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season comes to a close, it\u2019s time to take stock of this quarter's best and worst performers in the specialty retail industry, including GameStop (NYSE:GME) and its peers.\n\nSome retailers try to sell everything under the sun, while others\u2014appropriately called Specialty Retailers\u2014focus on selling a narrow category and aiming to be exceptional at it. Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a slower Q1; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1.4%. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and specialty retail stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 8.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME)\n\nDrawing gaming fans with demo units set up with the latest releases, GameStop (NYSE:GME) sells new and used video games, consoles, and accessories, as well as pop culture merchandise.\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $881.8 million, down 28.7% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 11.4%. From a fundamental perspective, this was a bad quarter for GameStop. Its revenue and EPS missed analysts' expectations, and it didn't share an outlook for the rest of the year. GameStop Total Revenue\n\nGameStop delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The stock is down 45.5% since the results and currently trades at $25.34.\n\nRead our full report on GameStop here, it's free.\n\nBest Q1: Dick's (NYSE:DKS)\n\nStarted as a hunting supply store, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is a retailer that sells merchandise for traditional sports as well as for fitness and outdoor activities.\n\nDick's reported revenues of $3.02 billion, up 6.2% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 2.7%. It was a strong quarter for the company, with optimistic earnings guidance for the full year and a decent beat of analysts' earnings estimates. Dick's Total Revenue\n\nDick's achieved the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth among its peers.

        "title": "Chewy stock spikes, then retreats, after 'Roaring Kitty' posts cryptic picture of dog on X",
        "content": "Chewy (CHWY) stock rose as much as 30% on Thursday after the X account linked to investor Keith Gill, also known as \"Roaring Kitty,\" posted a picture of a dog. The stock quickly retreated, though, and closed the day just below the flat line.\n\nPosts on Gill's account have been driving up shares of GameStop (GME) over the past month and brought a resurgence to the meme stock trade.\n\nAfter the market close on Wednesday, Chewy announced a $500 million share repurchase program. However, that news appeared to have little impact on the stock, which didn't jolt higher during Thursday's trading session until Gill's tweet.\n\nThe account's tweet at 1 p.m. ET sent shares of Chewy rocketing higher before the eventual pullback.\n\npic.twitter.com/jQBMX4jwjR\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) June 27, 2024\n\nGill recently talked glowingly during a YouTube livestream about GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen, who is also the founder of Chewy.\n\nGill explained his large position in GameStop was a \"bet on the management.\"\n\n\"In particular, of course, Ryan f***ng Cohen. Ryan Cohen and his crew,\" Gill said. \"That's what folks should be focused on,\" Gill said.\n\nOther pet stocks also caught a bid following the tweet, with shares of both Petco (WOOF) and PetMed Express (PETS) rising in afternoon trading.\n\nNotably, GameStop, which had previously moved higher off Keith Gill's reemergence, was up just 5% on the day, little changed after the tweet. The meme frenzy revival began last month, when GameStop rallied 180% over a span of two days after Keith Gill posted on X, formerly Twitter, for the first time since 2021. But since, shares have fallen as GameStop revealed a sales decline in the most recent quarter and issued more stock.

However, historically, traders are looking for certain stocks to sell during substantial growth.\n\nTypically, stocks experience some pullback, defined as a 10% decline from the recent high. While they do not seem ready to sell yet, there are hints of unease as investors worry about the concentration of gains within a small group of large tech companies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, returns have disproportionately benefited a select number of mega-cap tech stocks, resulting in divergent performance across the market. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) exemplifies this trend, briefly becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company. However, it relinquished this title within days, as its share price dropped 13% in one week, which fits the technical definition of a correction.\r\n\r\nThis raises the question of whether other recent stocks experiencing impressive gains may be worth selling before they tumble. The following three show signs of being overvalued.\n\nGameStop (GME) In this photo illustration the GameStop (GME) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe historically volatile GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock is one of the stocks to sell. It gained media attention recently due to an option purchase by a prominent social media investor. GME stock price has fluctuated over 480% in the past couple of months but trades 35% higher year-to-date (YTD). Understandably, its share price movements diverge from traditional investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBeyond the social reactions, GME has capitalized on heightened interest by issuing additional shares, raising $1.2 billion in its last quarter. While quarterly revenue growth declined 28.70% year-on-year (YOY), the company maintained profitability. Still, at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 296x, the GME stock appears to be influenced more by fluctuating online sentiment than sustainable profits.\r\n\r\nAnalyst consensus forecasts a 166.70% growth decline without profit this quarter, which appears to be a recent trend for the full year. Although just one analyst recommends selling GME shares, the average target price of $8.38 signifies a 65% downside. This somewhat aligns with GME\u2019s 52-week low at $9.95 per share.\n\nZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) A number of shipping containers with the ZIM Integrated Shipping Services logo on the side are stacked on top of each other.\n\nSource: Hieronymus Ukkel / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Israel-based container shipping company ZIM (NYSE:ZIM) has realized substantial growth in its stock price this year despite issues surrounding the conflict in Gaza. The market is influenced by several factors, including disruptions in the Red Sea, increasing demand from China to Northern Europe and higher fuel costs.\r\n\r\nZIM stock price is up over 106% since the beginning of January, with most gains occurring since late April in line with rising shipping rates. The sudden surge in the company\u2019s share price has surpassed analyst projections and left the stock vulnerable to market fluctuations. Consensus estimates show no profit next quarter, with earnings getting deeper into negative territory.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarlier this month, the ZIM share price experienced a correction after Citigroup\u2019s downgrade to a sell but has shown signs of recovery. Still, analysts do not believe the price increase can be sustained as their average price targets represent a potential 42% downside. Given the volatility and uncertainties, ZIM may be one of the stocks to sell.\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) The logo for Rocket Companies displayed on a smartphone screen (RKT). stocks to sell\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Companies (NYSE:RKT) is the final pick in this list of stocks to sell. The fintech company focused on real estate financial services and mortgages has not performed well this year due to the depressed state of the U.S. housing industry. As the market waits for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, RKT stock may still remain under pressure.\n\nWhile the company may grow when interest rates decrease, applications for new mortgages have been declining in the high-interest rate environment. Despite barely managing to remain profitable in the last quarter, operating cash flow registered -$1.57 billion.\n\nAnalysts do not appear convinced of Rocket\u2019s current prospects. None recommend buying RKT stock, and they have an average price target of $11.69 per share, representing a potential downside of 18%. Given the lack of analyst support and a forward P/E of 58.82x over half its current ratio of 117.50x, RKT stock may correct to deeper levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Now that the latest frenzy in GameStop (GME) has quieted down a touch from the hysteria seen earlier in June, pros say it's time for traders to conduct a reality check on the champion meme stock name \u2014 or else risk being left holding the bag, again.\n\n\"It's irresponsible for the newcomer into the market to think that this [GameStop trading activity] is anything else except gambling,\" veteran NYSE floor trader Peter Tuchman said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here).\n\n\"So many young traders who come to me ... are still long GameStop at $480 from the first [meme stock] debacle, and now they're going back to the well again to get themselves in trouble,\" Tuchman added. A quote by NYSE floor trader Peter Tuchman is featured next to a picture of him.\n\nTuchman knows a thing or two about spotting trouble in the eyes of market risk-takers.\n\nHe boasts more than 40 years of trading experience, mostly for clients down on the once-buzzing floor, and has become iconic for images of him doing his job each day. His wild white locks, black-rimmed eyeglasses, and savvy ways have garnered him the nickname \u201cEinstein of Wall Street.\"\n\nHis long career overlapped with many significant market events, including Black Monday, 9/11, and the Great Recession. And, of course, he traded right on through the last meme stock frenzy of 2021, which sparked the introduction of Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill to the investing scene. Trader Peter Tuchman works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ahead of the closing bell on June 21, 2019, in New York City. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nTo be sure, from a purely fundamental perspective, GameStop looks as speculative a bet as asking the dealer to hit you sitting on 20 at the Vegas blackjack table.\n\nThe company's first quarter sales cratered 29% year over year. The company lost a staggering $32.3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $50.5 million a year earlier.\n\nThe two sell-side analysts that still cover GameStop anticipate the company will produce losses in at least its next two fiscal years, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\nBehind these woeful numbers is a company refusing to aggressively shrink a physical store base that numbers 4,169 locations worldwide \u2014 despite the entire retail industry speeding toward an all-digital future.\n\nProfit margins are under pressure, and they have been for some time.\n\nAnd GameStop is overly reliant on gaming consoles \u2014 56.8% of sales came from hardware and accessories last year. But console sales face an increasingly grim outlook as PCs and smartphones compete for market share. Merchandise lines the shelves of a GameStop store on May 28, 2024, in Miami, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)\n\n\"GameStop stopped making sense from a business perspective a while ago,\" said retail expert and investor Jeff Macke on Opening Bid (watch here; listen below). \"They're packed away in the mall where ... the newsstand used to be and the shoe polish guy,\" Macke added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdd to that a reclusive CEO calling the shots, and you have the wild swings in GameStop's stock that Tuchman and Macke contend should be warning signs to rational investors.\n\nGameStop stock went from a high of $66 when \"activist investor\" turned CEO Ryan Cohen joined the board in January 2021 to a low of $9.95 in mid-April before the latest bout of Keith Gill shenanigans on X, formerly known as Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nShares currently trade at $23, down 52% from the intraday high hit on June 6.\n\nCohen has used the renewed trader appetite to bolster GameStop's cash coffers, much to the delight of his many supporters on forums like X and Reddit.\n\nThe company received $2.1 billion recently after selling another 75 million new shares. Some three weeks earlier, it sold 45 million shares, netting $933 million.\n\n\"You can never lose sight of the fundamentals,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on Opening Bid.\n\nSomehow, we think Tuchman and Macke would agree.\n\nGameStop is beginning to look more like a holding company than a games retailer, author and retail expert Jeff Macke said on the episode of Opening Bid below.\n\nOpening Bid Episode List\n\nInside Amazon\u2019s race to become a $10 trillion giant What a Biden-Trump rematch means for the largest retail stocks Affirm\u2019s founder talks Apple partnership, Elon Musk, & AI Fortune EIC: Microsoft is sexy under CEO Satya Nadella GameStop and the meme stock saga: Opening Bid investor guide Ford CEO on EVs, Detroit, and texting Elon Musk Warren Buffett\u2019s son talks $800m aid efforts to Ukraine From BlackBerry to Wall Street with Sonos' CEO Inside the intense world of billionaire Ray Dalio Why GameStop isn't a value stock, but pure greed China tariffs, Nvidia earnings, how to view Apple How to spot the tech unicorn to invest in John Chambers' advice for navigating the 'AI decade' Amazon AWS CEO reveals his biggest thoughts on AI How Trump, Nvidia CEO, and Fed Chair may influence U.S. economy Alphabet and Meta are handing out free money The potential for a market shock\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "When meme stocks start skyrocketing, it\u2019s difficult to find a good entry point.\n\nAlready, examples of a big rally in meme stocks happened in the recent past. In just over a month, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock surged from sub-$5 levels to 52-week highs of $23.9. With a meme frenzy on the cards, it\u2019s time to look at meme stocks to buy on dip. Additionally, these can be stocks that have remained subdued in the recent past, but are in the radar of meme stock investors.\n\nWhen talking about meme stocks, fundamentals take a back-seat. However, my idea is to look at stocks that can go ballistic on speculation yet still have decent fundamentals. The advantage with these stocks is that the correction after a big rally is unlikely to be deep.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is a good example of the type of meme stock to avoid. GME stock had recently surged to 52-week highs of $62.8. However, the downside has been sharp and the stock trades at $23.7. I would not be surprised if the downtrend sustains on the back of poor fundamentals.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s discuss the meme stocks to buy on the dip for a stellar rally.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) seems to be massively undervalued at a forward P/E of 14 considering the impending growth. In the last 12 months, RIOT stock has declined by 15% and still has a short interest that\u2019s almost 19% of the free-float. I expect the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) miner to quickly double or triple from current levels in the next few quarters.\n\nNotably, Riot Platforms has strong fundamentals with a zero-debt balance sheet. Further, the company has a cash buffer (including value of digital assets) of $1.3 billion. This provides headroom for aggressive capacity expansion.\n\nThe Bitcoin miner ended Q1 of 2024 with a capacity of 12.5EH/s. By the end of the year, capacity is likely to increase to 31.5EH/s. This will translate into healthy revenue and EBITDA growth. Thus, the meme rally will be supported by positive financial developments.\n\nFurthermore, Riot Platforms intends to increase capacity to 100EH/s by 2027. If the execution is on-track, 5x to 10x returns are on the offering in the next 24 to 36 months.\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company Aurora Cannabis (ACB, blurred marijuana leaf (focus on left part of letter R in center)\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com\n\nI expect plenty of action in cannabis stocks with the U.S. Presidential elections round the corner. Renewed debates on federal level legalization are likely. Additionally, regulations seem to be getting friendlier globally with Germany legalizing cannabis. So, I believe that cannabis stocks will surge on any meme frenzy.\n\nStory continues\n\nAurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) looks interesting considering the point that the stock has remained sideways for almost 12 months. A big breakout is likely if business developments remain positive.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Aurora Cannabis ended fiscal year 2024 on a positive note. For Q4 of 2024, the company reported the sixth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Also, the cannabis company reaffirmed its guidance to achieve positive free cash flow by December 2024.\n\nWith ACB having presence in Germany, growth is likely to accelerate on the back of regulatory tailwinds. Additionally, Australia is an attractive market for the company. Overall, Aurora Cannabis seems to be positioned to survive and grow, and the stock is likely to surge after an extended period of consolidation.\n\nEntera Bio (ENTX) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nEntera Bio (NASDAQ:ENTX) had surged to 52-week highs of $3.35 in April. However, there has been a sharp correction from those levels, and ENTX stock trades at $1.87. I see this as a good opportunity to buy before the meme stock surges.\n\nAs an overview, Entera Bio is a clinical-stage biotech company that\u2019s focused on oral delivery of peptides and other therapeutic proteins. The company\u2019s most advanced product, EB613, is for the treatment of high risk, post-menopausal osteoporosis. Further, EB612, is for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.\n\nImportantly, osteoporosis impacts 200 million women globally. Further, no new osteoporosis therapy has been approved since 2019. Therefore, EB613 has a big addressable market. With the product entering phase three of trials, it\u2019s likely that there will be significant price-action in the coming quarters.\n\nNotably, Entera Bio has cash runway through Q3 of 2025. Therefore, there is no immediate risk of equity dilution driven stock correction.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures are muted following a drop in AI-exposed chipmaking stocks in the prior session. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slipped in particular, extending a decline in the maker of artificial intelligence-optimized processors into a third straight day. Elsewhere, meme-stock investor Roaring Kitty's stake in GameStop (NYSE:GME) falls into the red, according to the Financial Times, while the price of Bitcoin dips in volatile trading.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered close to the flatline on Tuesday after a mixed previous session highlighted by a drop in many artificial intelligence-related equities.\n\nBy 03:29 ET (07:29 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 37 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures were broadly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 10 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a one-month high on Monday, as some investors rotated out of AI-exposed semiconductor firms like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in favor of other sectors such as energy. Nvidia, the chipmaking giant and AI-darling, dipped for a third consecutive session (more below).\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest one-day decline in nearly two months, while the benchmark S&P 500 ended the trading day 0.3% lower.\n\nMarkets are looking ahead to the release of the personal consumption expenditures price index report -- the Federal Reserve's preferred metric of inflation -- on Friday. The reading, which is tipped to show an easing in price pressures, could influence expectations for potential Fed interest rate reductions later this year.\n\n2. Nvidia shares tumble\n\nNvidia shares fell another 6.7% on Monday, extending losses for a third straight session and erasing more than $430 billion in market capitalization over the three-day slide.\n\nThe California-based AI chipmaker ended last week with a market valuation of around $3.1 trillion, lower than Apple\u2019s $3.2 trillion and Microsoft\u2019s $3.3 trillion. The group briefly overtook Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) last week to become the most valuable company in the world.\n\nDespite the recent slide, Nvidia shares have surged by 138% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq 100 index.\n\nAnalysts have suggested that the downside move has more to do with sector rotation and profit-taking than fundamental issues at the business.\n\nOn Monday, analysts at Jefferies raised their price target to $150 per share from $135 while reiterating a Buy rating, arguing that \"Nvidia remains both king and kingmaker\" in the AI sector.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Roaring Kitty slips into the red - FT\n\nA drop in shares in videogame retailer GameStop briefly pushed meme-stock influencer Keith Gill's position down into the red on Monday, according to analysis from the Financial Times.\n\nShares in GameStop, which had spiked last month in the wake of Gill's return to social media after a three-year absence, dipped below the $23.4135 price he paid for his 2.1% stake, the FT said.\n\nThe stock closed at $23.65, above Gill's purchase price but down by roughly 1.2% for the day. It has now slumped by more than 17% over the past five sessions.\n\n4. Bitcoin volatile\n\nBitcoin moved lower on Tuesday in volaile trading, as a mix of regulatory fears, particularly over U.S. action and German government sales, coupled with broader risk aversion, kept crypto prices under pressure.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency had fallen 2.5% in the past 24 hours to $60,908.5 by 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT). It had dropped below the $60,000 mark in overnight trade, but later rebounded back above this level.\n\nBitcoin was nursing steep losses through the past week due in part to reports that the German government was selling tokens confiscated from a piracy website. This may lead to an influx in Bitcoin available in the market.\n\nMeanwhile, other reports said the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission was investigating market maker Jump Trading over its crypto trading activities. Jump President Kanav Kariya also said he was leaving the firm.\n\n5. Crude stable\n\nCrude prices steadied Tuesday ahead of the release of the latest information regarding U.S. crude inventories during the summer driving season.\n\nBy 07:28 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $81.56 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $85.03 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks rose about 3% last week, marking two straight weeks of gains, boosted by increased demand as the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, enters the peak summer consumption period.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute is set to release its forecast of U.S. crude oil stockpiles later in the session, ahead of the official report on Wednesday, and stocks are expected to have declined in the week to June 21.\n\nThat said, traders are cautious about pushing the market too much higher given that interest rates remain relatively elevated, potentially limiting growth in fuel consumption in the world\u2019s largest economy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia dips amid drop in chipmaking stocks, Bitcoin choppy - what's moving markets\n\nSri Lanka to sign agreement with creditor nations on Wednesday\n\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss drug approved in China\n\nView comments",

        "content": "More exciting things are happening inside the market than Nvidia stock (NVDA) going up almost every day.\n\nVeteran New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) floor trader and co-founder of Wall Street Global Trading Academy Peter Tuchman pointed to the bull market in stocks ushering in 40 million new retail investors into the market over the past few years as very \"exciting.\"\n\nAs a result of this influx, household net worth remains on the ascent.\n\nUS household wealth rose to a record of more than $160 trillion in the first quarter, according to the latest data out of the Federal Reserve. During that time, household net worth rose by 3.2%, or $5.1 trillion, with the appreciation in stock prices accounting for $3.8 trillion of the gain.\n\n\u201cWe are at the crossroads,\u201d Tuchman said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). \u201cWe are in an extraordinary time and history.\"\n\nThese new retail investors have broadened their exposure beyond popular meme names such as GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC), which dominated Robinhood (HOOD) trading accounts in 2021.\n\nThe latest Robinhood Investor Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 most owned investments on the trading platform, shows that retail investors have plowed into companies they understand and that impact their daily lives, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAnd yes, Nvidia.\n\nMaking investing more accessible to more people is a good thing to see, Tuchman added.\n\n\u201cAll those barriers to entry that were really significant and kept this a very exclusive place, those days are over,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really great thing. Suddenly everyone\u2019s been invited to this party.\u201d\n\nTuchman has traded through a lot of market parties through the decades. He is known for iconic images taken of him on the NYSE trading floor, and his wild hairstyles and savvy ways garnered him the nickname \u201cEinstein of Wall Street,\u201d for valid reasons.\n\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes guarding the velvet ropes and being Mr. \u201cNo\u201d outside the door of Studio 54, owning a jazz record store, and working at a jazz club.\n\n\u201cMy approach to the market was different than your normal person analyzing the market,\u201d he said.

Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he took a summer job as a teletypist on the exchange floor and eventually worked his way up to broker.\n\n\u201cThe energy, the adrenaline, for me, the minute I walked onto the floor, I knew this was for me,\u201d he reflected.\n\nTuchman\u2019s career overlapped with many significant down market events including Black Monday, 9/11, and the Great Recession. \u201cYou saw people losing futures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also saw the capacity and resilience of human beings in the workplace.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThis past week, there was plenty of resilience, energy, and adrenaline on hand as markets hit new highs.\n\nInvestors saw Nvidia rise to a $3.34 trillion market cap, making it briefly the most valuable company in the world, beating Apple at $3.29 trillion and Microsoft at $3.32 trillion before the stock lost ground.\n\nThis enthusiasm for Nvidia points to its sound position in artificial intelligence going forward \u2014 something for 40 million new investors to consider.\n\nDespite the market being hot, it's still important to do your homework and seek out value.

        "title": "From Memes To Millions: How Roaring Kitty Surpassed Another Unexpected Investing Icon",
        "content": "From Memes To Millions: How Roaring Kitty Surpassed Another Unexpected Investing Icon\n\nPages and pages have been written in the last few years about two surprising investing icons, Keith Gill and Nancy Pelosi. Gill, a former financial analyst, is widely recognized for igniting the GameStop surge in late 2020 through his YouTube channel as Roaring Kitty and his posts on Reddit.\n\nGill\u2019s transformation from a regular financial analyst to a multimillionaire is a tale of clever investments, internet fame, and the influence of social media. Using detailed analysis and his charismatic personality, he strongly promoted investing in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock when it was about $5 per share.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss\n\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share. Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\n\nIt was his belief in the undervalued potential of GameStop that resonated with many retail investors and sparked a movement that turned the stock into a sensation.\n\nIn January 2021, the stock market was rocked by something unprecedented \u2014 the GameStop short squeeze. Retail investors, inspired by Gill\u2019s analysis and frustrated by Wall Street hedge funds\u2019 practices, bought GameStop shares en masse, driving the stock price up by over 1,500% to a short-lived peak of $483 per share. This event highlighted the power and influence of retail investors in the modern digital world.\n\nToday, Keith Gill\u2019s financial status has reached new heights. After exercising his call options, Gill currently holds 9,001,000 shares of GameStop, which, at the time of writing, are valued at $25.59 per share. This amounts to approximately $230,335,590. If you add his $6 million in cash, his paper net worth is $236 million. It's important to note that the value of his holdings is subject to market fluctuations, and such concentrated investments carry significant risk.\n\nTrending: No generation before Gen Z has had this investment opportunity \u2013 How successful Zoomers plan to retire in their 30's.\n\nAt the same time, his impressive portfolio has solidified his position as the fourth-largest investor in GameStop, just behind major players like RC Ventures, Vanguard, and BlackRock. While many believe there\u2019s still potential in GME stock, the future is uncertain, given the stock\u2019s volatility.\n\nSurpassing Nancy Pelosi\n\nNancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House, is well-known for her considerable wealth, estimated to be between $120 million and $251 million. Her financial portfolio includes investments in tech stocks and various real estate properties, supported by her husband, Paul Pelosi\u2019s successful venture capital firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nPelosi\u2019s wealth and investments have sparked some criticism. People say her large fortune doesn\u2019t match her views on income inequality. There's also worry that her investments, especially in tech stocks, involve insider knowledge, creating a conflict of interest. Others feel that her wealth makes it hard for her to relate to and represent everyday Americans effectively.\n\nGill\u2019s gains from GameStop have made him wealthier than Pelosi. His clever investments and the viral GameStop surge worked out perfectly, showing the potential impact of retail investing.\n\nIn 2023, his story was turned into a movie called \"Dumb Money,\" with actor Paul Dano playing him, sharing his journey with a wider audience. But apart from his unusual June 7 livestream on YouTube and occasional meme or position update on Reddit, Gill has decided to mostly stay out of the spotlight.\n\nWhile it's natural to feel like investing more in a successful stock, it's essential to recognize that Gill's success comes from a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Hence, it is always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to understand the potential risks of your investment strategies and ensure a more secure approach.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

        "content": "What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday?\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT), the operator of the Truth Social platform, is trading higher on Monday. Last week the company announced it expects to receive over $69.4 million from the cash exercise of warrants on June 20 and 21, 2024.\n\nThe cash exercise option became available after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the company\u2019s registration statement effective on June 18, 2024,\n\nTMTG revealed that if all warrants covered by the registration statement are exercised for cash, the company could receive up to approximately $247 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company will have $40 million of restricted cash become unrestricted due to the effectiveness of the registration statement. These funds add to the over $200 million in unrestricted cash already held by TMTG as of June 18, 2024.\n\nThe infusion of funds will likely support further development and expansion of its platforms, including Truth Social.\n\nTMTG has experienced a significant decline in market value. The conservative social media company\u2019s stock has dropped nearly 50% since May 30, following the conviction of former President Donald Trump on 34 felony counts in a hush money trial, CNN reports.\n\nDespite the falling share price, experts warn that TMTG remains overvalued. Truth Social is a minor player in social media compared to platforms like Elon Musk's X, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram Threads.\n\nSome experts compare TMTG to meme stocks like GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (NYSE:AMC), which trade on momentum rather than fundamentals.\n\nTrump, the dominant shareholder with 114.75 million shares, has seen his stake\u2019s value drop from $6 billion to about $3.1 billion since late May. The company plans to use the funds raised to enhance its ad platform and explore potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nTMTG stock gained 118% in the last 12 months.\n\nPrice Action: DJT shares are trading higher by 7.12% to $29.63 premarket at last check on Monday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Which is worse: Elon Musk\u2019s $46 billion pay package or GameStop\u2019s $3 billion ATM?\r\nThis article is mostly about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Tesla stock. However, a guest essay in the New York Times by J. Bradford DeLong, an economics history professor at the University of California, got me thinking about both of these economic travesties.\n\nWith Tesla stock, its shareholders reapproved CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $46 billion pay package originally thrown out in January by the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Chancellor Kathleen McCormick agreed with plaintiff shareholders who argued his 2018 pay package was over the top.\n\nShareholders didn\u2019t see it this way. Approximately 72% of the votes were for the pay package, which does not include Musk\u2019s shares or his brother\u2019s, who sits on the board.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCircling back to DeLong\u2019s guest essay, he gets into the whole idea of meme stocks, using GameStop (NYSE:GME) as a classic example. Its recent use of meme-stock mania to raise $3 billion in at-the-market funding highlights the problems associated with uninformed investors buying stock not worth the paper the shares were written on.\n\nThese two situations are examples of the outlandish misuse of shareholder funds. Here\u2019s why Tesla\u2019s actions are far worse for markets than GameStop\u2019s shenanigans.\n\nGameStop Broke No Laws\n\nAs much as I hate to admit it, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen took advantage of meme-stock mania, and raised $3 billion in cash for the beleaguered video game retailer, all of which could be invested in other companies.\n\nIn late May, I discussed how the company\u2019s ATM offering proves that public companies still matter.\n\n\u201c[A] privately held version of GameStop would likely not be in nearly as good a financial position without the ability to raise cash through ATM offerings,\u201d I wrote on May 30.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a longtime shareholder, especially one who bought at $80 in 2021 and still holds, the ability of a public company such as GameStop to make such a move is a tremendous godsend.\u201d\n\nWhile it boggles my mind that anyone would trust Ryan Cohen to pick stocks when he\u2019s done absolutely nothing to fix the core business after owning shares since August 2020 and as CEO since last September, it bears repeating that GameStop\u2019s broken no laws.\n\nIf politicians don\u2019t like it, they should encourage the SEC to change the rules.\n\nExcessive Pay Is Only an Issue If Shareholders Say It Is\n\nElon Musk\u2019s pay package is obscene. There\u2019s no other way to describe it. Paying the world\u2019s wealthiest person, who already has $208 billion, another $46 billion on top of that, is akin to paying Happy Gilmore $100 million to join the LIV Golf tour. It makes no sense.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet all his sycophants trotted out their most complimentary comments before and after the result was announced.\n\n\u201c\u2018We think that Elon is critical to Tesla\u2019s success,\u2019 said Tasha Keeney, director of investment analysis at ARK Invest, which counts the automaker among its largest holdings. \u2018I think it\u2019s very important that Elon stays at the helm,\u2019\u201d the New York Times reported on June 13.\n\nKeeney\u2019s boss, Cathie Wood, appeared on CNBC on the day of the vote, suggesting that TSLA stock could reach $2,600 by 2029. Wood is known to throw out Tesla predictions, primarily because it\u2019s such a large portion of the assets under her control.\n\nIf Tesla has no Elon, she would probably have to close her asset management business.\n\nInterestingly, while shareholders had no problem voting for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Chancery Court could stick by its ruling, which would bring Tesla\u2019s board back to square one, searching for a way to keep the man-child focused long enough to stick around and design new, reasonably-priced, electric vehicles for mass consumption.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Tesla Stock\n\nNow that Musk looks prepared to stick around for 3-5 years, longtime shareholders can rest easy knowing that his attention will be EVs, not his other ventures. However, shareholders have no assurances that he won\u2019t up and leave this time next year without warning or an explanation.\n\nIn Q4 2021, Tesla\u2019s gross automotive margin was 30.6%. By Q4 2022, it was 470 basis points lower at 25.9%. Five quarters later, it\u2019s 17.4%, 43% lower over the past nine quarters.\n\nHow is that irreplaceable? It\u2019s a terrible message to send to front line Tesla employees. It will hurt the company more than we know.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The Return of Meme Stock Madness: Should You Steer Clear of GME, AMC and RDDT?",
        "content": "Meme stock madness has returned to Wall Street after a three-year hiatus, with Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. Keith Gill) drawing in massive crowds online with his big bets on GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock.\n\nThough Roaring Kitty has since (reportedly) dumped his GME options, he\u2019s still long on the stock big-time, with a huge stake worth anywhere from $220,000 to $262,000. Given how profoundly volatile GME stock has been, the value of his stake is sure to change by double-digit percentage amounts on any given day.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to tell what Roaring Kitty\u2019s intentions are this time around, I still think investors should resist the urge to follow him. And I most definitely would not want to bet against him, as GME stock could easily spike overnight on no news.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the 2024 edition of the meme madness, GME stock has skyrocketed twice already, and it may or may not be the last time it will do so. So, whether or not Mr. Gill\u2019s hands are made of diamonds, investors should be very cautious when approaching such a choppy name if they\u2019re seeking to invest rather than spin the roulette wheel.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop logo on the smartphone screen and blurred background. GME stock\n\nSource: mundissima / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop stock is coming off a sharp plunge after its latest spike above $45 per share, now down around 47% off that second spike. Undoubtedly, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that many speculators are looking for that third spike to hit in the coming weeks or months. Could the third time be the charm? I have no idea, nor does the Roaring Kitty himself.\n\nWith the stock pulling back on the day Gill went live on stream, GME stock continues to be a mysterious mover. Many bulls will likely get hurt as the volatility remains off the charts going into the summer. Additionally, many shorts are at serious risk of losing more than just their shirts. It will be interesting to see how the meme frenzy plays out for the rest of the year.\n\nEither way, I\u2019d not look to get in on the mania, even if CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s cost-cut plans can help the firm turn a corner. At the end of the day, the stock will move based on euphoria rather than the fundamentals.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is the iconic movie theatre chain that\u2019s getting caught up in the meme stock boom once again. Compared to GME, AMC stock has been relatively tame, with the stock pulling back just shy of 30% from that May 2024 peak.\n\nAs the company continues chipping away at its debt load while taking steps to return to the growth track in the face of streaming headwinds, AMC stock definitely seems like a more tempting meme stock to back versus the likes of GameStop. Even if you\u2019re a fan of the business and its turnaround trajectory, punching your ticket here could prove nothing more than a gamble, especially if meme traders continue taking their profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell when the meme madness will fully wind down and the May spike will dissipate. Either way, investors should exhibit caution, especially as AMC succumbs to meme stock madness that could easily go either way.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Reddit Layoffs. Phone showing Reddit logo on screen in front of blurred background with reddit logo. Reddit IPO. AI Stocks\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock\n\nReddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) is the social platform that\u2019s been really buzzing of late as meme stock investors gather to reveal their plans for stocks like GME and AMC shortly. Whether we\u2019re talking about the r/WallStreetBets or the company\u2019s recent licensing deals with various artificial intelligence (AI) firms, like OpenAI, I view RDDT stock as perhaps the most investable stock on this list.\n\nThough tricky to value, the company has notable tailwinds that could help extend its run. As more investors begin viewing Reddit as a data resource for AI companies, I view the potential for additional multiple expansions. Additionally, Reddit may benefit from infusing AI across various parts of its platform.\n\nIn any case, RDDT stock stands out more as a data-centric way to play the AI boom. Any meme stock-driven upside from here is nothing more than a bonus for investors with the discipline to lighten up.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After weeks of surging through the hype, GameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME)\u00a0fanfare appears to finally be subsiding. Now, retail investors are more aware of this stock\u2019s risks in times of short squeezes and meme frenzy. Indeed, holding GME stock poses heightened risk of total loss amid a dip in market sentiment. Management could retreat from investment positions due to market panic. Also, there\u2019s always the potential for future stock issuance, if the price does go up.\n\nIt\u2019s my view that GME stock is a meme stock best avoided right now. There\u2019s really no way to win (and I say that on both sides of the trade \u2013 I think this is a dangerous stock to short as well).\n\nHere\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t touch this stock with a 50-foot pole.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n$2B Capital Raise Thanks to Roaring Kitty\n\nGameStop raised over $2 billion in its second share sale within a month, following a surge influenced by Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty. This occurred shortly after Gill\u2019s first YouTube livestream in three years.\n\nThe stock saw a 23% increase on Tuesday and doubled over the past six months. This is due to its popularity in retail investors during the pandemic. At the same time, these meme stocks were also rising. Also, they often saw significant price swings due to heavy bets against them by hedge funds.\n\nThe company announced on June 11 to the New York Stock Exchange that it successfully sold all 75 million shares offered, raising $2.137 billion. This adds to the $3 billion raised over the past month from share sales as its market value soared, including $933.4 million from selling 45 million shares previously.\n\nEarlier this month, GameStop\u2019s shares surged following a Reddit post linked to Keith Gill, indicating he held 5 million shares valued at over $100 million, sparking a rally among online investors in 2021.\n\nKeith Gill Boosts GME Holdings\n\nDue to the Roaring Kitty putting influence on meme stocks like GME, he also boosted his investment to nine million shares. As a result, Gill became the fourth largest shareholder. He exercised call options at $20 each, increasing his portfolio to $268 million.\n\nGameStop closed at $28.70, down 1.44% on Friday, affecting Gill\u2019s portfolio by $9 million per dollar change. This shift alters GameStop\u2019s shareholder landscape, paralleling Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ryan Cohen\u2019s 2020 holdings.\n\nGME Stock Looks Like a Trap\n\nDespite GameStop\u2019s deep expertise covering 55 retail companies, the company chose not to apply any sophisticated analysis this past quarter. Its Q1 sales declined 29% year-over-year (YOY) and lost over $32.3 million. However, it was a small improvement from last year\u2019s loss, which reached $50.5 million. To me, it\u2019s completely evident that the company\u2019s business trends continue to deteriorate and will likely continue to do so moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company resisted reducing its 4,169 global stores, unlike competitors like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which chose to invest in AI and same-day delivery, rendering store visits obsolete. If GameStop\u2019s management team doesn\u2019t change something, and fast, it could be game over sooner than later for this company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Why is Reddit so Great for Research on Stocks?",
        "content": "We recently made a list of 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks. Reddit is one of them. While Reddit is not a finance platform, the threads it has on investing are extremely useful.\n\nWhen it comes to building a strong portfolio, retail investors conduct a great deal of research to learn about the macroeconomic climate, read up on the most recent stock market trends, become familiar with investing strategies, and observe the most notable actions of smart investors and elite hedge funds. A sizable portion of the investing community consists of retail investors, and they have access to a wealth of online information that can assist them in navigating the volatile stock market. According to Gallup\u2019s survey, 162 million Americans, or 62% of adults in the United States, own shares in public companies. That is a 1% rise over 2023 and the highest percentage observed by Gallup since 2008. During the Great Recession, stock ownership declined and remained low for more than a decade, reaching lows of 52% in 2013 and 2016. Before 2008, the majority of Gallup surveys revealed that at least 60% of American adults owned stocks.\n\nToday, the stock market is very different from what existed at the time of the millennium. The internet has democratized information, resulting in increased\u00a0 stock market involvement, which has been accelerated during the pandemic. Wall Street welcomed retail investors for the first time as a result of the pandemic, even though the global outbreak is primarily remembered for the deadly virus and lockdowns. In apoll, 15% of American stock market participants stated they started investing in 2020. The study additionally shows that these new investors tended to be more optimistic about their prospects for success in the stock market. A study revealed that 19.5% of all stock market shares exchanged in the first half of 2020 were made by individual investors. That is about twice as many trades by ordinary investors as there were in 2010, and it represents an increase of 4.5% over 2019. This occurred during the meme stock mania in 2021, which saw prominent businesses skyrocketing on the stock market as retail investors banded together on social media and purchased the shares in bulk.\n\nNotwithstanding the attraction of potential profits, new research from eToro indicates that many retail investors in the United States appear to be more afraid of losing money than they are of missing out on the next great opportunity. Rethinking Risk, research by eToro, finds that while 31% of US retail investors are driven by the fear of missing out on the next great thing, 61% of investors indicate that their investment strategy is shaped by the fear of losing money through immoderate risk. Their behaviors, however, reveal a different tale, as many retail investors continue to invest in risky assets, with 70% holding single stocks and 41% holding crypto assets in their portfolios. Additionally, this research shows that 62% of people who began investing in the markets now feel better about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these developments, the demand for easily available, reliable information to aid retail investors in their decision-making is rising. According to a survey conducted by BNY Mellon and the World Economic Forum on global retail investment, three-quarters of current retail investors said they would trade more actively if they had more opportunities to learn about investing along with personalized, goal-oriented stock guidance. Here's where trustworthy websites for stock research would come in very handy. Why is Reddit so Great for Research on Stocks?\n\nStocks chart\n\nMethodology:\n\nFor our list of the best websites to research stocks, we ranked them on the basis of consensus of several sources and reddit threads on the same topics. A website received one point everytime it appeared on a source, and we only selected websites that appeared at least thrice in our research. Furthermore, we also considered quantifiable factors in these websites that create substantial value for their audience and scored them additional points for that.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nReddit\n\nOne of the best websites for stock research is Reddit, which is an online forum. Investors typically discuss their latest trades, trending stocks, portfolio profits and losses, and macroeconomic conditions on Reddit, an online forum. WallStreetBets, a community of 12.5 million Redditors discussing their personal trade ideas and portfolio compositions, is Reddit's most popular investment thread. Subreddits like r/investing, r/stocks, r/biotech, and r/pennystocks are also crucial for stock research.\n\nRedditors have a strong community and can easily push up prices and influence the stock market, which is why WallStreetBets has created several meme stocks over the years. GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of the most popular meme stocks of 2024 on Reddit. The Texas-based company is a supplier of games and entertainment products. However, a surprising earnings announcement shows that GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME)\u2019s revenues continue to fall. First-quarter net sales were $0.882 billion, down from $1.237 billion in the same period last year. According to Reuters, the company has been losing money for several years due to its reliance on physical storefronts at a time when people buy video games and collectibles online, and the most recent quarter was no exception.\n\nIn Q1 FY 2024, 8 hedge funds reported holding shares in GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), down from 12 funds the previous quarter. The company's largest shareholder, Andrew Sandler's Sandler Capital Management, owned 3,452,000 shares, valued at more than $43.22 million in Q1.\n\nReddit ranks 4th on our list, but if you want to check out what other websites are and where they rank, visit the 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks.

        "content": "As the stock market grows, savvy market watchers must know that all that glitters is not gold. In the landscape of soaring indices, certain stocks represent ticking time bombs, laden with issues that could lead to significant declines when the market cools off.\n\nThe market\u2019s current exuberance masks underlying vulnerabilities in several sectors, where companies face critical challenges ranging from operational inefficiencies to overstretched valuations. General market trends or temporary catalysts may have buoyed these stocks. Still, as the broader financial climate shifts, they are poised to falter, carrying a significant risk of loss.\n\nInvestors should be particularly wary of stocks showing signs of bloated valuations with no fundamental earnings support and companies struggling under excessive debt. Steering clear of these high-risk investments can be prudent as the market approaches a potential downturn. Here are three stocks that appear too toxic to touch, poised for a downturn when the market inevitably shifts from its current highs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNIO (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNIO (NYSE:NIO) has been navigating a tumultuous period marked by declining revenues, intensified competition and significant financial losses. Despite efforts to expand its product line and enter new markets, the company\u2019s performance continues to lag behind industry leaders, raising concerns about its prospects.\n\nNIO\u2019s path to profitability remains uncertain amidst its current financial challenges. The company\u2019s continuous operational losses and declining cash reserves highlight the need for strategic capital raises, which could lead to further shareholder dilution.\n\nNIO\u2019s first quarter results in 2024 revealed an 8.7% year-over-year (YoY) decline in total revenues, falling short of market expectations by $75 million. Vehicle sales suffered due to a decrease in average selling prices, attributed to adjustments in user rights since June 2023. The company\u2019s operational losses widened, with NIO posting a net loss of $728 million, approximately 9% worse than the previous year.\n\nThe company\u2019s guidance for Q2 2024 showed mixed signals. NIO projected revenues between $2.297 billion and $2.373 billion, well ahead of the average street estimate of $1.99 billion. However, vehicle delivery guidance of 54,000 to 56,000 units was somewhat disappointing given that April and May combined already accounted for over 36,150 deliveries.\n\nGameStop (GME) Medium shot of a video game developer team brainstorming. Video game stocks\n\nSource: Frame Stock Footage / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) has recently captured the market\u2019s attention again following a dramatic uptick in stock price driven by speculation and investor frenzy. Despite this surge, GameStop\u2019s underlying financial health and business model are exposed to significant risks.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, GameStop reported a 29% revenue decline to $881.8 million, primarily due to intense competition from e-commerce and online gaming platforms. The company\u2019s operating loss for the quarter was reported at $32.3 million, reflecting ongoing struggles to adapt to the rapidly evolving retail landscape.\n\nGameStop\u2019s challenges are compounded by the shift towards digital gaming, which has significantly reduced the demand for physical game sales, traditionally GameStop\u2019s forte. Competitors with robust online platforms continue to erode GameStop\u2019s market share, making it difficult for the company to regain footing.\n\nGameStop\u2019s valuation has surged in the short term, but this increase appears disconnected from its financial realities. The company is trading at multiples significantly above historical averages without corresponding improvements in financial performance.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has recently been on a roller coaster ride. The company\u2019s survival hinges on continued aggressive financial restructuring and capital market activities. Despite some positive moves to reduce debt, the overall outlook remains grim due to persistent operating losses and heavy competition from streaming services.\n\nAMC\u2019s Q1 2024 results highlight the company\u2019s ongoing struggles. Revenue was essentially flat compared to Q1 2023, with $951.4 million reported. However, the net loss was substantial at $163.5 million, a slight improvement from the previous year\u2019s $235.5 million.\n\nSo far in 2024, box office results have been dismal. The drop can largely be attributed to the SAG-AFTRA strike pushing many movie releases to later in the year. While the domestic box office is expected to pick up with a stronger slate of movies like \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d projections still put the domestic box office at around $8.2 billion for the entire year, down -10% from 2023.\n\nHence, avoiding AMC stock is financially prudent, given the current financial pressures and competitive dynamics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohammed Saqib did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Paris Gets a Wild Meme Stock as Atos Becomes a Chatroom Favorite",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The logic-defying swings in shares of Atos SE suggest Paris is experiencing a slice of the meme-stock craze seen in the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack Putin\u2019s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO\u2019s Eastern Border Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Manchester United\u2019s Jim Ratcliffe Fears for Future of Premier League\n\nAnalysts have warned that shares of the struggling French technology company could become almost worthless following a restructuring. But Atos stock has defied that assessment.\n\nAfter closing at a record low on June 13, Atos more than doubled in the following four sessions. On Thursday, it surged as much as 46%, triggering multiple trading halts, before giving up much of those gains. Atos is the most discussed stock on Boursorama.com, an investor forum owned by Societe Generale that\u2019s popular among French retail traders.\n\n\u201cIn a word, this move is \u2018insanity,\u2019\u201d said Neil Campling, founding partner at Chameleon Global Capital. \u201cThe company\u2019s own statement basically said equity was near enough worthless.\u201d\n\nAtos, loaded with close to \u20ac5 billion ($5.4 billion) in debt, has been under a restructuring process with creditors and banks to try to avoid bankruptcy. Earlier this month, the company chose a bailout proposal from a group led by David Layani\u2019s Onepoint, its top shareholder.\n\nThe rescue plan would involve issuing new shares to reduce debt, a move that will result in a \u201cmassive dilution\u201d of current stockholders, the company had warned. Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the stock would be worth \u20ac0.01 in a base-case scenario.\n\nWith about two hours left of Thursday\u2019s session, about 26 million Atos shares had already changed hands. It\u2019s set to be the biggest single-day volume for the stock in at least two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 19.6 million shares traded on Wednesday.\n\nPart of the stubborn resurgence in the stock is down to short sellers taking profit on bets that Atos would slump. A market mechanism requiring short sellers to return the shares to the holders who loaned them out \u2014 by buying stock in the market \u2014 is also a factor, according to traders.\n\nShort sellers have been steadily paring bearish bets on Atos. Shares out on loan represented about 15% of the stock\u2019s free float as of Tuesday, down from a peak of 36% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAnd then there are the retail investors, apparently taking on the short sellers in a French version of the frenzy over shares in GameStop Corp., which has been powered higher by a cohort of buyers responding to the musings of social media personalities.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut unlike the case with GameStop, which inflicted heavy pain on some short sellers, the surge in Atos shares probably won\u2019t hurt those using the strategy in the French firm\u2019s stock as much.\n\nThat\u2019s because large short positions in Atos were established when the price was much higher, said Ivan Cosovic, founder of data tracking firm Breakout Point in Dusseldorf, Germany. The stock has fallen 70% this year and is down 86% from a 2023 peak.\n\n\u201cEven with the recent dramatic rebound of almost 300% from its June lows, big shorts holders might not be feeling significant pressure,\u201d Cosovic said in an email.\n\nAtos didn\u2019t immediately reply to Bloomberg\u2019s emailed request for comment.\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Muller.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds Documents Show How Musk\u2019s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo Coke\u2014and Dozens of Others\u2014Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "It\u2019s time for GameStop (GME) to stick a fork in its flailing retail operations and embrace a second life as a holding company in the mold of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A)(BRK-B).\n\nGameStop is \u201ca totally different company now,\u201d said retail expert and investor Jeff Macke on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u2018Opening Bid\u2019 podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nThough he now refers to GameStop as a \u201cdump truck,\u201d Macke's sentiment wasn\u2019t always so chilly. He said he owned its stock five years ago, when it was trading at $4 a share, with the view its operations were being undervalued.\n\nLater, he sold the stock for $25 a share.\n\n\u201cI thought I was the genius of all time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Gamestop is filled with fundamental woes as of late, which has raised the question if the Ryan Cohen led company is even a retailer anymore.\n\nFiscal first-quarter results included a $32.3 million loss on revenue of $882 million. Notably, GameStop lost $50.5 million on revenue of $1.2 billion last year.\n\nThe company continues to be pummeled by structural changes in the video gaming industry \u2014 from the switch to digital downloads, to competition for eyeballs with streamers like Netflix (NFLX), to an aging console gaming base.\n\nCohen has basically went into hiding, not appearing on the company's notoriously short earnings calls. His plans for GameStop aren't known to his loyal Reddit followers or larger investors. C-suite execs have been exiting in the past two years.\n\nGameStop also no longer has any sell-side research coverage on Wall Street, a byproduct of the stock's insane volatility and Cohen's relative secrecy.\n\nAmid the latest batch of poor results, GameStop promoter Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill returned to the scene on June 7 in a bizarre livestream; he once again touted the company, causing shares to enjoy a temporary, fleeting bump.\n\nThis follows a post on social media from Gill several weeks earlier \u2014 after a long absence \u2014 that many GameStop loyalists saw as bullish.\n\nCohen has used the frenzy to bolster GameStop's cash coffers.\n\nThe company received $2.1 billion last week after selling another 75 million new shares. Some three weeks earlier, it sold 45 million shares, netting $933 million.\n\nInvesting pros like Macke are wondering what Cohen will do with all the cash. Does he go out and buy companies like Berkshire Hathaway? Does he put it into Treasuries and individual stocks ala Buffett to earn a return?\n\nEither way, this sounds more akin to a CEO heading an asset management firm or holding entity, than one seeking to create amazing store experiences for shoppers.\n\nStory continues\n\nMacke views plowing money into physical stores as less-than-ideal, anyway.\n\nGameStop's dead mall locales and outdated merchandise models are two of its numerous problems, he contended.\n\nInstead, he envisions a scenario where GameStop ditches the dead malls and tries to function as a holding company.\n\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway was a failing textile company when Warren Buffett took over,\u201d he said, adding that GameStop looks more like \u201cBerkshire Hathaway for suckers.\u201d\n\nBut, with $3 billion to $4 billion in cash, the challenge is finding the best way to put that to work. \u201cIt won\u2019t be in GameStop,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt will be in other opportunities.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of famed holding companies, billionaire Warren Buffett's son Howard G. Buffett hopped on the 'Opening Bid' podcast to discuss his father's decades long work at Berkshire Hathaway.

        "content": "Meme stocks are essentially shares of a company that have gained immense popularity through social media. Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d on social media, helped start this craze, which became amplified through the subreddit r/WallStreetBets.\n\nThis led to the price of meme stocks exploding before subsequently dying down. This has happened again quite recently, with Gill\u2019s return to social media. Meme stocks that were thought to be dead or dying suddenly showed signs of life.\n\nNow, Gill is the fourth-largest holder of GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares, based on an account update from the beloved social media user that shows a position of 9 million shares. This came after he closed out of his position in about 120,000 call options.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBecause meme stocks tend to trade more on internet chatter and not business fundamentals, they aren\u2019t investments for a buy-and-hold portfolio. If you do own any meme stocks, you might want to sell them asap before the meme stock trade crashes. When it does, you don\u2019t want to get stuck going down with Roaring Kitty\u2019s ship.\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop is a retailer that focuses on the videogame and gaming niche. It operates through both a physical and online marketplace. While it is quite U.S.-centric, GME also operates in Canada, Australia and Europe.\u00a0Roaring Kitty is now the fourth-largest investor in GME stock.\n\nAfter a bombshell disclosure by Keith Gill, who showed that he had tens of millions of dollars invested in GME, the stock went up by over 70% at one point.\n\nHowever, this also made GME grossly overvalued \u2014 by an average of 66.07% as per analysts. The company has missed the last two earnings estimates and has seen negative quarterly revenue growth of 28.70%.\n\nAdditionally, there are no strong growth catalysts for GME at the moment. Recently, CEO Ryan Cohen said the company would focus on cutting costs in the upcoming days. While this is a welcome change, when combined with declining sales and other factors, this puts GME in a precarious situation. Thus, I believe that it is time to offload this meme stock.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is one of the largest theatre chains in the U.S. and the world. Just like GME, although it is primarily U.S.-based, AMC also has operations in Europe. It is currently trading at a valuation of $4.86, with AMC stock being down 88% over the last year, showcasing its inherent volatility.\n\nDespite annual revenue increasing, AMC continues to lose money. Additionally, over the last three quarters, the chain has begun to see its revenue decline. AMC is still producing losses as well, though last quarter they did narrow considerably. In addition to this, the company is heavily in debt with $8.99 billion in corporate borrowings, operating leases and exhibitor services agreements It has only $624.2 million in cash and equivalents. A negative free cash flow of -$281.74 million isn\u2019t helping AMC either.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere appears to be a lack of growth prospects as well. Since the pandemic, people have become increasingly attracted to on-demand streaming services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Prime Video, Hulu, etc. This has directly had a negative impact on AMC and there\u2019s no data to suggest the trend is reversing. It makes AMC a meme stock you should sell instantly.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is an America-based electric vehicle (EV) company. While it is quite ambitious, the fundamentals of LCID do not work in its favor. This has made this once-promising company a meme stock that you should sell.\n\nLCID saw an earnings decrease during its last fiscal year. In fact, Lucid lost 54.06% more than FY2022. While it has seen decent revenue growth, it loses money on every car it makes. Lucid\u2019s operating margin of -422.55% nullifies the sales it makes. Additionally, the company is carrying EBITDA of -$2.8 billion, which offers excellent insight into the tumultuous nature of the company\u2019s internal operations.\n\nThe catalysts for this company offer only grim news. Just last month, analyst forecasts became more bearish for LCID, which carries a negative wave with it. Investors will likely get spooked by this, driving its share price down further. Additionally, LCID recently laid off 6% of its workforce, which certainly isn\u2019t a positive indication, making this a stock you should sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is yet to cut interest rates and make capital cheaper. FUD fund futures project the central bank will cut rates two times this year, with the first one in September, which could influence decisions on meme stocks to sell.\n\nBut even if that happens, the market would get a signal that the economy needs to be stimulated even though inflation is off the 2% target. Historically, such an indicator would make the market more volatile in the short run. And which asset is inherently volatile already? Meme stocks.\n\nIn fact, investors may be looking at macro data and pushing in the profit-taking direction. This alone would put a sell pressure on these assets as a self-fulfilling prophecy. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at meme stocks to sell, ones that have had plenty of gains already to lock in profits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe meme twin of GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) benefited from mid-May\u2019s return of Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty, the stock meme maker. At that time, AMC announced the sale of shares worth $164 million. Accounting for accrued interest and principal, that would place the stock price at $7.33 per share.\n\nThis was just after the filing of 72.5 million sold shares, raising $250 million, at an average price of $3.45 per share. While this goes a long way in diminishing AMC\u2019s debt, it is still exceedingly high at $10.56 billion as of the latest May filing.\n\nConcurrently, AMC\u2019s accumulated deficit actually grew from the year-ago quarter, from $7.9 billion to $8.15 billion. At the same time, the company is yet to churn out a substantial profitable quarter (net income above $114M) since 2013.\n\nThe question investors need to ask then, are AMC fundamentals ever going to bridge this gap? Simply put, meme fumes alone are unlikely to cut it. Aligning with lower arts attendance, 6% less in 2022 than in 2017, movie theater attendance is even worse, showing little to no signs of recovery.\n\nAlongside poorer movie quality, ideological commitments from movie studios that cause friction with audiences, and less security in urban areas, investors also have to account for new habits. Social media is habituating users to short-form content, and people are socializing less for coordinated excursions to movies.\n\nCompounded with consumer weakening via inflation, none of it points to AMC\u2019s recovery. At the present price of $4.86, AMC stock is double its 52-week low of $2.38 per share, making for a solid exit point. Investors who are betting on memory have a 52-week high of $54.97 to look for, as an unlikely and brief scenario.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nFocusing on digital lending, investing, and personal finance, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) has become popular with retail. This garnered their attention outside the user experience into the SOFI stock itself, similar to Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD).\n\nIn turn, SOFI stock has seen much volatility during 2024, settling at 33% decline year-to-date (YTD). Unlike AMC, however, SOFI doesn\u2019t have weak fundamentals. The platform gained 20% more accounts year-over-year (YOY) to current $151 million.\n\nSoFi Technologies increased net income in Q1 of 2024 substantially, $88 million from net loss of $34.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, if the Fed\u2019s hard landing happens, these figures will go down. At present price of $6.42, SOFI stock almost matches its 52-week low price, which is not far from the 52-week average of $8.01 per share.\n\nThe bottom line is, SoFi Technologies is not a weak stock, but its volatility injected a lot of noise, ahead of macro headwinds. This marks SOFI stock as one of meme stocks to sell, but to keep it in mind later on.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeter Thiel\u2019s Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is a great case of locking in profits. Known as deeply embedded in deep state operations owing to its data integration and analytics platforms, the company lacks weak fundamentals.\n\nIn the last Q1 of 2024 earnings, PLTR (named after far-seeing crystal balls in The Lord of the Rings) achieved 21% YOY revenue growth. Ahead of the government revenue increase of 16%, commercial revenue grew by 27% YOY, with 42% client base growth.\n\nMore importantly, the company continued its six-successive quarters profitability streak. However, with market volatility on the horizon, and the company\u2019s five years of net losses, this is a strong case to designate PLTR as one of meme stocks to sell.\n\nPresently priced at $25.82, PLTR stock is above its average 52-week level of $19.01, and nearly doubles its 52-week low of $13.56 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is among the top global theater chains many investors have ignored for its underlying business model.\n\nIndeed, most retail investors in this name are investing not for the company\u2019s fundamental growth prospects or its outlook moving forward. Those are rather negative.\n\nIt\u2019s the company\u2019s upside potential as a meme stock, and its corresponding short-squeeze potential, that drives most of the discussion around this name.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile AMC has certainly seen many near-term surges over the past few years, there\u2019s a reason why the trend has remained negative.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think cautious is advised for investors seeking a high-upside growth opportunity in this current environment.\n\nWhat Jim Cramer Has to Say\n\nAmong the talking heads many investors don\u2019t pay much attention to, Jim Cramer has been outspoken about many names during the previous incredible meme stock rallies we\u2019ve seen.\n\nOn the meme stock front, he\u2019s been largely right, suggesting investors ignore names such as AMC right now.\n\nInteresting, Jim Cramer recently noted a paradox among bullish investors. Such investors seek a slowing economy with rate cuts and strong demand to shield their firms from risks like the yield curve.\n\nDespite economic weakness, some companies have thrived. Cramer highlighted the manufacturing slowdown, with the ISM index falling to 48.7 in May from 49.2 in April, marking the 18th contraction in 19 months; he found May\u2019s new orders decline particularly concerning.\n\nCramer advised buying oil and gas stocks, expecting a rebound in the economy. He also noted strong retail performances from major retailers and cyclical names, which he found unexpected.\n\nAs a bear on AMC and the meme stock movement, his recommendation is to sell, as there\u2019s simply not enough in the way of fundamentals to support this recent rally. Here, I have to agree with Cramer on this one.\n\nAMC is Similar to GameStop\n\nAMC Entertainment, following GameStop (NYSE:GME) as a top meme stock, lacks GameStop\u2019s recent improvement in per-share losses. To many investors, this shows a less-promising recovery path.\n\nTo raise funds, AMC has engaged in multiple dilutive share offerings amid low moviegoer turnout. The company is diversifying into puzzling endeavors such as AMC-branded candy, citing extensive R&D with confectioners, despite ongoing financial challenges.\n\nI\u2019m not sure these investments will pay off, and it\u2019s unclear what the ROI will be on these moves.\n\nI think this strategy raises questions about prioritization, especially as AMC continues to report significant net losses without year-over-year improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nUntil the company focuses on creating a business model that can be cash flow positive and show accretive earnings growth, this is a name to steer clear of.\n\nSell AMC Stock Before It\u2019s Too Late\n\nIt\u2019s my long-standing view that the movie theater model has officially been broken.\n\nConsumers just aren\u2019t watching movies as they previously have \u2014 we\u2019ve entered a new era of entertainment, one that\u2019s driven by streaming and at-home offerings which are better than visiting the cinema.\n\nYes, AMC has seen some recent strength in its blockbuster movies and foot traffic metrics. But despite record recent volumes, there\u2019s simply not enough here for investors to jump aboard and buy into this flailing business model.\n\nOver the long-term, I expect AMC stock to trend toward zero. Short squeeze enthusiasts and meme stock traders have only delayed the inevitable.\n\nI think investors who want to position their portfolios for success may want to steer clear of this stock altogether right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

CEO Ryan Cohen told investors the video game retailer plans to \"continue reducing costs and focusing on profitability,\" without elaborating.\n\nShares fell 12% and slipped further on Tuesday, but are still up over 100% this quarter amid extreme volatility. Much of the gains have been driven by retail investor \"Roaring Kitty\" who disclosed an update to his GameStop holdings in early May, after a three-year hiatus.\n\n\"In some ways it's kind of a repeat of the meme stock trading we had in 2021. It's the same person, Keith Gill a.k.a. Roaring Kitty again,\" Michael Piwowar, former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission and now executive vice president of finance at the Milken Institute, told FOX Business.\n\nGAMESTOP RAISES OVER $2B IN STOCK SALE DURING ROARING KITTY CRAZE\n\nPiwowar said it does not appear Gill is doing anything illegal under the current rules, but he does believe the SEC is very likely reviewing whether there are any violations and perhaps discussing whether the current rules are adequate to protect investors and guard against market manipulation.\n\n\"The SEC got a wake up call three and a half years ago and hit the snooze button,\" Piwowar said. \"If this is something that the commission decides is not in the public interest, and the commission decides that it's not in the interest of fair, orderly and efficient markets, and protecting investors, they could change the rules,\" he explained.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe SEC, in response to a prior inquiry from FOX Business, said it \"does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\"\n\nGill has since followed with vague social media posts open to interpretation, including one late Monday showing former tennis legend John McEnroe during his professional playing years. McEnroe was famous for his volatile on-court temper.\n\nGill's livestream in early June, which drew in about 600,000, did not provide much new detail, but he did endorse Cohen\u2019s leadership. Keith Gill, a Reddit user credited with inspiring GameStop's rally, speaks during a YouTube livestream arranged on a laptop at the New York Stock Exchange in New York on Friday, June 7, 2024.\n\nWHO IS \u2018ROARING KITTY' - WHAT TO KNOW\n\n\"It becomes a bet on the management\" of GameStop \u2013 particularly on CEO Ryan Cohen \"and his crew\" \u2013 during the \"transformation stage\" that he believes the\u00a0video game retailer has entered.\u00a0\"That\u2019s probably going to be an ongoing debate as to how people feel about him, whether he can successfully transform that business,\" the meme stock retail trader said, cracking jokes here and there. He also reminded his viewers to \"make your own decisions.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHe updated his position on June 13 on Reddit under his \"DeepF---ingValue\" handle. Based on a posted screenshot, he now owns 9 million shares purchased at $23.41 per share. The value has risen to $262 million. His cash position dropped from around $29 million to $6 million, with his total stake worth $268 million.\n\nHis call options, valued at $81.7 million during his June 10 update, are no longer on the account ledger. He could have exercised those or sold them outright.\n\nFOX Business is unable to verify the accuracy of the account screenshot.\n\nThis month, GameStop reported a\u00a0net loss of $32.2 million compared with a loss of $50.5 million in the year-ago period. Sales fell 28% to $881 million, down from $1.2 billion.\n\nThe company also plans to sell up to another 75 million shares on top of the 45 million already sold.\n\nOriginal article source:GameStop meme stock mania is SEC\u2019s bad dream on repeat\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) held its delayed annual meeting for shareholders on Monday, June 17. The anticipation was palpable. Originally scheduled for June 13, the meeting had to be postponed because the livestream attracted so much attention it crashed the host\u2019s servers.\n\nThe rescheduled meeting, however, was a let down. CEO Ryan Cohen spoke briefly, espoused generalities and gave little hint at what the plan was for the video game retailer\u2019s future. He took no shareholder questions and the virtual meeting concluded within 30 minutes.\n\nNot even investors were impressed. The stock tumbled to close the day down 12%. The question remains, where is GameStop going?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeme Stock Revival\n\nGameStop stock has been on a steady downward slide since the meme stock heyday of 2021. It was only recently revived when Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty on social media, returned to pump up his holdings in the stock again.\n\nThat caused GameStop stock to triple in value virtually overnight and also brought along a number of other dead or dying meme stocks with it.\n\nIt also allowed the video game retailer to raise nearly $1 billion through a stock sale. While that padded GameStop\u2019s bank account, it is not doing much to turn around the business.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why investors were disappointed when Cohen failed to provide much direction or give an indication of where the retailer is heading.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Here to Work\u201d\n\nThere was one takeaway from the meeting and that was GameStop is going to be getting smaller. Cohen correctly pointed out that without profits, whatever revenue the retailer makes is useless to shareholders.\n\nTo get there, GameStop is going to have to shrink. \u201cThis means a smaller network of stores with an expanded assortment of higher value items that fit into our trade-in model,\u201d Cohen said. \u201c\u2026 We are not here to make promises or hype things up. We\u2019re here to work.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, that is what investors want to hear from management. Ignore the noise and get down to business.\n\nUnfortunately, what the business of GameStop is remains unclear. Sales are plummeting, operating losses are growing and the retailer has no problem diluting shareholders to make a cash grab.\n\nYet the trade-in model Cohen is pursuing seems like a cigar stub strategy as the video game industry increasingly moves to the digital and download model.\n\nSucking the Oxygen Out of the Room\n\nWarren Buffett coined the term \u201ccigar butt investing.\u201d It is a strategy of buying beaten-down stocks that still have some value in them. You can still get a few puffs of profit out of them before they are all used up.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cA cigar butt found on the street that has only one puff left in it may not offer much of a smoke,\u201d he wrote to shareholders, \u201cbut the \u2018bargain purchase\u2019 will make that puff all profit.\u201d\n\nWhile there may still some value in GameStop, it is getting difficult to see there being many puffs left.\n\nInvestors have little to go on but hope that Cohen can turn the company around. Which is why they would have liked getting some reassurance on what was in store.\n\nBecoming a much smaller retailer, even if it becomes profitable, is not a growth strategy to buy into. A small fish in a small pond does not instill much confidence or enthusiasm.\n\nGameStop hasn\u2019t traded on its fundamentals in years. But holding on in hopes of the next Roaring Kitty post to revive shares is not investing. It is wishful thinking and gambling and is why GameStop stock should be avoided.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t know who you are the stock market is an expensive place to find out,\u201d stated legendary economist Adam Smith, back in 1723!\u00a0That certainly applies currently to degenerative or \u201cdegen\u201d traders.\u00a0As described\u00a0in a recent Wall Street Journal article, these are more gamblers than traders. Like so many others, they are all consumed by the wild\u00a0swings in GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other volatile meme stocks. But savvy day traders can enjoy the same rush with robust returns and much reduced risk by trading utility stocks instead.\n\nAny stock, even those with a beta well below the market average, has plenty of movement.\u00a0From these ups and downs in the share price daily traders can buy or short the\u00a0stocks\u00a0to profit. Much of this is based on mean reversion trading.\u00a0If the price is higher than the historical average, short it.\u00a0If the price is lower than the historical\u00a0average, buy!\u00a0Long story short, the price was set at that historical\u00a0level by the market so it will probably return.\n\nAs a day trader, the risk\u00a0is reduced as you are not holding your position for long.\u00a0Trading utility stocks is ideal for mean reversion trading\u00a0as they offer a high daily volume of shares\u00a0traded with a low beta. And many times, a high dividend yield for those who want income from their assets.\u00a0Just like all other day trading, you want a tax-free account with no commission transactions and the best execution to net the most.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCENTERPOINT ENERGY (CNP) Centerpoint Energy Southern Indiana headquarters.\n\nSource: Kurt D. Eichmiller / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Houston, CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) operates in the Southwest and the Midwest. Volume is around 5 millions shares daily with a beta close to the market avereage of 1. That combination is ideal for day trading utility stocks. There is plenty of liquidity and movement to profit from going long and short.\n\nWith a 2.62% dividend\u00a0yield, there are capture-the-dividend\u00a0profits that await.\u00a0These can also be from shorting the stock at this period too.\u00a0The stock price does not just rise around the X-dividend, or any date for that matter.\u00a0It falls, too, to be back to the optimal price as determined by market forces.\n\nThe customer base for CenterPoint is growing. During the pandemic, the stock traded well below $20 a share. Now it is over $30, right around the year-high.\u00a0The low this year was around $27.\u00a0For those day trading utility stocks, CenterPoint Energy clearly has the stability and liquidity for profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nEXELON (EXC) The logo for Exelon (EXC) is visible at the top of an office building.\n\nSource: photosounds / Shutterstock.com\n\nEXELON (NYSE:EXC) is the nation\u2019s largest utility.\u00a0There is much to be said for go big or go home in day trading.\u00a0With about 6.3 million\u00a0shares traded daily, traders do not have to worry about distorting the price when going long or short.\n\nThe low beta is testament to that.\u00a0The price of Exelon does not move that much, owing largely to institutional ownership.\u00a0Stocks that do not swing wildly are good for day traders as there is little concern about being caught on the wrong side of a volatile swing.\u00a0There are many feeling that pain now from GameStop movements that you will not get from trading utility stocks.\n\nEven though the beta is about half the market average, the price of Exelon still ranged from $33 to $43 over the last year.\u00a0That is pleny of latitude for those trading utility stocks to profit both long and short. There is also a 4.34% dividend to reward those who want to focus on buying and holding EXC.\n\nWEC ENERGY GROUP (WEC) WEC Energy Group logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) also serves Midwestern states.\u00a0The stock is trading near its year low.\u00a0WEC is down for the last week, month, quarter and year of market action. That is good news for those who looked to short the stock.\n\nBut there is plenty to like for the long side too.\u00a0The profit margin and operating margin are bullish.\u00a0Sure, some of that is due to the price falling.\u00a0But a 16.65% profit margin when the average for a utility is under 10% is certainly alluring.\n\nSo is the dividend yield of 4.2% , a beta of 0.41 and institutional ownershop\u00a0of aroud 80%. This a bullish combination as it shows institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension groups are committed to the stock. Much of that is due to the dividend. This dedication is ideal for day trading utility stocks for long and short profits as there should not be wild swings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jonathan Yates did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AMC Stock Warning: This Meme Saga Could Reach the Final Chapter",
        "content": "AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock surged with other top meme stocks following Keith \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d Gill\u2019s much-hyped return to social media. The famed meme trader\u2019s activities (now under scrutiny) led to another short-lived wave of meme stock madness.\n\nUnfortunately, this speculative frenzy has ended. AMC holders have a lot to lose. The stock may now be trading below pre-meme stock phenomenon prices. Still, AMC Entertainment isn\u2019t a bargain. The stock\u2019s underlying value is well below current prices.\n\nAMC Stock Should Have You on the Edge of Your Seat\n\nAMC may hold steady at around $5 per share, but chances are the stock isn\u2019t going to hang tight for long. Yes, there is a possibility that another meme wave emerges. After all, following his latest buy, \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d may have another trick up his sleeve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, if meme mania returns for an encore, it may only have, at best, a moderately high impact on the short-term performance of AMC stock.\n\nAs we\u2019ve pointed out before, the whole \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d situation only directly involves one meme stock,GameStop (NYSE:GME). AMC and other meme plays have only partially come along for the ride.\n\nMoreover, there\u2019s a good chance that, given the aforementioned scrutiny, and how poorly the latest \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d social media event went, further stunts may have little impact on GME, much less other meme stocks.\n\nHence, it\u2019s better to assume that, not too long in the future, AMC makes another big move, but in the other direction.\n\nThat is, a renewed focus on the company\u2019s poor fundamentals will drive a severe re-pricing. Put simply, if you currently hold a position, this should be having you on the edge of your seat.\n\nA Late Summer Reversal\n\nAMC has raised billions selling newly issued shares, but with this substantial share issuance has come severe shareholder dilution.\n\nIf that\u2019s not bad enough, while the company has used a good portion of these capital flows to pare down debt, it\u2019s had to use quite a bit of it to absorb continued operating losses as well.\n\nThat\u2019s because the company has still yet to fully recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on movie theater attendance.\n\nBox office figures so far this year have trailed that reported in 2023. This trend is expected to continue through the busy summer movie season. Best case scenario, the 2023 U.S. summer box office could be down 27% compared to summer 2023.\n\nAdmittedly, this is largely due to the impact of last year\u2019s Hollywood union strikes, which affected and delayed film production.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat may not matter much to investors, when AMC next reports fiscal results. This is expected to occur sometime in early August.\n\nPoor quarterly earnings and a dilutive equity raise could reverse shares in late summer.\n\nBottom Line: Duck Out Now\n\nLike we\u2019ve noted before, all signs point to further downward spiral for AMC shares.\n\nTo get its financial house back in order, AMC needs to sell or issue billions worth of additional new shares. At least, based on the company\u2019s $4.5 billion in total long-term debt.\n\nEven if such heavy dilution ends up happening, it may still not be enough to stem further losses. Irrespective of whether there is additional shareholder dilution, a further slump for the movie business stands to weigh down further on the stock.\n\nNeed even more convincing? Unless results improve dramatically, the AMC stock meme saga is going to eventually reach the final chapter: Chapter 11. If you\u2019re still sitting in the theatre, there\u2019s no need to sit through the credits. Consider it time to duck out.\n\nAMC stock earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Faraday Future (FFIE) Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?",
        "content": "You could almost feel retail investors celebrating in late May after shares of electric vehicle maker Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NASDAQ:FFIE) surged from 4 cents to $1.80. The stock briefly became the most researched stock on InvestorPlace.com, and social media sites made it sound as if the only direction FFIE could go was up.\n\nOf course, this simplifies the situation.\n\nCalling Faraday Future an \u201cEV maker\u201d is relatively generous, considering the firm built roughly 15 vehicles last year and sold just four. (It also leased six and has several more as finished goods on its balance sheet). \u201cEarly-stage EV startup\u201d is a more fitting term. As for research, most of our InvestorPlace.com writers have consistently warned readers to stay away from the firm for its \u201chigh risk and little reward profile.\u201d InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto goes even further, suggesting investors buy puts on the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese warnings have largely gone ignored, given the numerous call options remaining on the stock. The company also continues to be worth over $200 million on public markets.\n\nThat\u2019s because there is a grain of truth that Faraday Future might keep going up. Stocks are worth precisely what buyers are willing to pay, and history tells us that meme stocks can often see a \u201cdouble peak\u201d as latecomers jump in.\n\nThe Double Peak\n\nPerhaps the best example of resurging meme stocks is GameStop (NYSE:GME). In March 2021, shares of the videogame retailer spiked a second time after a new wave of speculators joined in. Unlike early investors, these latecomers cared little about the company\u2019s valuation or its underlying business. According to Google Trends, search volumes for \u201cGME\u201d overtook those of \u201cGameStop\u201d by almost a 2-to-1 ratio that month.\n\nIn other words, if people were making money on the ticker, why bother knowing anything more about the company?\n\nThe results are as you might expect. Shares of GameStop rebounded from a split-adjusted $10 that February to over $66 the following month.\n\nA similar story happened with AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). Here\u2019s the same chart with FFIE overlaid onto the popular meme stock. Few traders discussed the cinema chain\u2019s post-Covid-19 recovery during AMC\u2019s second peak. To these brave speculators, the stock became a symbol of an \u201cApe\u201d movement that would last long after AMC\u2019s 2021 surge.\n\nThe Single Peak\n\nMeanwhile, other meme stocks decline without ever catching a second wind. Consider BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD), which briefly tripled in 2023 after announcing it would use OpenAI tools to help create content\u2026\n\nStory continues\n\nOr Genius Group (NYSEMKT:GNS), a Singapore-based firm that popularized the idea of investigating naked short sellers after appointing a former FBI director to lead a task force\u2026\n\nIn both of these cases, the companies themselves were the ones driving headlines. Meme investors never seemed to get as truly committed and quickly forgot about these companies once the news cycle moved on. These meme stocks had far less time in the spotlight\u2026 and less sustained momentum as a result.\n\nFFIE Stock: To the Moon or Straight to Zero?\n\nThat\u2019s worrying news for Faraday Future, a firm that has seen excitement disappear almost as quickly as it began. Since mid-May, search volumes for \u201cFFIE\u201d have fallen 86%, while \u201cFaraday Future\u201d volumes have yet to pick up.\n\nSocial media boards have also lacked significant chatter about super-normal returns. The company has no equivalent of Keith Gill to share screenshots of multimillion-dollar profits. Reddit\u2019s r/FFIE subreddit \u2014 a social media forum \u2014 turns decidedly negative any day shares go down.\n\nMost worryingly, consumers seem apathetic about Faraday\u2019s cars despite glowing performance reviews. The company has roughly 300 non-binding, fully refundable preorders, which is a rounding error compared to the 10,000 reservation figures that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) once sported. Most people on the street would fail to recognize a photo of a flagship Faraday FF91 SUV.\n\nThese issues are compounded by Faraday\u2019s publicity-shy management. In 2022, the company fired its media-savvy co-founder, Jia Yueting, after a scathing short report called him a \u201csecurities fraudster.\u201d The company has yet to find a suitable replacement, and Jia has even come back as an unofficial (and unwelcome) spokesperson for the company.\n\nThat suggests investors will quickly forget this meme stock\u2019s recent rise and fall. Faraday Future remains too small to have made ripples in the stock market, and the scant amount of cash left on hand suggests the company won\u2019t last much longer as a going concern even if meme investors pump the stock again.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Another week has past and GameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) stock has grown more volatile, putting investors further at risk.\n\nOn June 12, GameStop stock plunged 25% on reports that investor Keith Gill, who goes by the online handle \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d exercised most of the 120,000 call option contracts he had.\n\nGill apparently used the options contracts to buy even more GME stock. As the trading week ended on June 14, Gill shared a screenshot of his investment account that showed he held over nine million shares of GameStop, up from five million shares previously.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGill\u2019s increased holdings of GameStop did no more for the company\u2019s share price than his livestream event on YouTube June 7.\n\nThe fact that Gill is foolish enough to continue buying GME stock doesn\u2019t change the fact that GameStop remains a troubled company and bad investment.\n\nDiluting Shareholders\n\nAs for GameStop, the company and its CEO Ryan Cohen have responded to the renewed interest in the stock by selling more stock and diluting the holdings of existing shareholders.\n\nGameStop recently raised $2.14 billion from a share sale, capitalizing on the fact that GME stock more than doubled in price after Gill began posting again on X and returned to YouTube.\n\nIn all, the video game retailer has raised more than $3 billion since mid-March via share sales as retail investors jumped back into the stock. The latest sale of 75 million shares was at an average price of $28.49 each.\n\nHowever, since Gill held his livestream on YouTube, GameStop\u2019s stock has been extremely volatile. That volatility, combined with the share dilution, has once again burned many investors who fell for the hype around GME stock.\n\nQuestions That Need Answers\n\nThe current situation surrounding GameStop \u2014 both Roaring Kitty\u2019s return and the company\u2019s stock sales \u2014 have raised a lot of questions.\n\nMarket regulators have announced that they are investigating Keith Gill for potential market manipulation, and there has been speculation that Gill could be working in concert with GameStop, driving up the stock price so that the company can sell shares at top dollar.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on is unclear, but there are questions that shareholders, regulators, analysts and the media want answered.\n\nInvestors hope to raise those questions at GameStop\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, which was recently canceled and rescheduled for June 17. How forthcoming management is at the meeting will be interesting to see. Hopefully they outline a plan for the company\u2019s future after its dreadful earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nSell GameStop Stock\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to be gained from taking a position in GameStop stock. The company is in terrible shape, with declining sales, inept management, and a failed turnaround strategy dragging the share price lower.\n\nInvestors who are buying into Keith Gill\u2019s return are likely to be burned just as they were when he last pumped the stock up on social media and then abruptly disappeared for three years, earning millions of dollars for himself and leaving other investors deep in the red. GameStop stock is not a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in GameStop (NYSE:GME) were lower in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday, pointing to further declines in the stock following a steep drop in the prior session.\n\nGameStop's stock price slumped by 12.1% on Monday after the videogame retailer's CEO Ryan Cohen told investors that the company would shrink its network of stores as part of a push to boost profits.\n\nCohen also did not outline what GameStop plans to do with the almost $4 billion cash pile it has accrued from share sales in May and June, saying only that it was an \"advantage\" to have a stronger balance sheet. According to analysts cited by Reuters, investors were disappointed that they did not receive a more detailed strategy aimed at reinvigorating GameStop's flagging business.\n\nSales have been waning as more players shift online and away from the new or used videogame discs typically sold by GameStop. In an earlier-than-anticipated first-quarter earnings release this month, the firm said net sales had fallen to $881.8 million, down from $1.24 billion a year ago.\n\nBut GameStop said it had raised $933 million from a stock sale in the wake of a spike its share price last month, as well as an additional $2.14 billion in June. The moves came after Keith Gill, an investor known online as \"Roaring Kitty\" who helped spark a craze around so-called meme stocks in 2021, reemerged on social media in May and appeared to disclose a big bet on the company.\n\nThe shares are now trading well below their level reached after Gill's return, and have shed over 70% of their value since hitting intraday highs in 2021.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGameStop shares edge lower premarket following 12.1% slump on Monday\n\nThis is when you should consider selling Nvidia stock\n\nCiti lifts S&P 500 year-end target to 5600\n\nView comments",

The number would be an acceleration from 0.0% in April, when expenditures on many goods were tempered by elevated gasoline prices.\n\nInvestors will also focus on the speeches of Fed officials this week, including Boston Fed President Susan Collins and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin later in the session.\n\nOn Monday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker backed one 25-basis point cut in 2024, echoing a median rate forecast for the rest of the year that was released by policymakers last week.\n\nTesla battles for CEU Musk\u2019s pay package\n\nIn the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will remain in the spotlight as the electric car manufacturer has initiated its battle for legal recognition of Chief Executive Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package after shareholders voted in favor of the compensation agreement, after a judge had previously voided the pay earlier this year.\n\nElsewhere, Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) stock soared 20% premarket after the education technology group announced plans to slash 23% of its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring push.\n\nLennar (NYSE:LEN) stock dropped 3% premarket after the homebuilder forecast its third-quarter home deliveries below expectations, a sign that demand for new homes is expected to remain sluggish as mortgage rates hover at a two-decade high.\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 1.5% premarket, continuing the previous session\u2019s sharp losses, after CEO Ryan Cohen told investors that the video game retailer plans to operate a smaller network of stores.\n\nCrude slips on demand worries\n\nCrude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session\u2019s gains, as the global demand outlook remains uncertain amid plentiful supply.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy 06:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% lower at $79.48 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $84.05 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks gained around 2% on Monday, closing at their highest since April.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that China, the world\u2019s largest crude importer, was struggling to produce a solid economic recovery, while the U.S. economy was feeling the weight of prolonged exposure to high interest rates.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures edge higher; retail sales release looms\n\nAmazon Labor Union votes to ratify Teamsters affiliation\n\nChina's rich ditch flashy luxury as global sales stall, says Bain\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Roaring Kitty brought meme stocks back to life. His first post in three years in mid-May caused GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares to triple in value almost overnight. It also dragged other left-for-dead meme stocks along for the ride.\n\nYet, the reaction to the meme lord (his real name is Keith Gill) by Wall Street was telling. The Wall Street Journal reported that discount broker E-Trade, owned by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), was mulling whether to ban him from the platform. The investment firm\u2019s financial crimes division was examining whether his options trades before his social media post were legal. The trades also came under scrutiny from the Securities & Exchange Commission and state securities agencies.\n\nWhile we can debate whether the video game retailer is a good investment \u2014 I tend to disagree with Gill \u2014 canceling him and prohibiting him from trading seems extreme.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t be up for debate is the meme stocks to sell below. These companies had no business jumping as they did. Gill wasn\u2019t recommending their shares, only GameStop. Traders were simply trying to revive the meme stock-buying frenzy of 2021.\n\nHere is why you should avoid these meme stocks to sell.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nMovie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became every bit as much of a poster child for the meme stock trade as GameStop. Diehard loyalists deemed themselves \u201capes\u201d who would HODL (hold on for dear life) to AMC stock no matter what. Unfortunately, that hasn\u2019t amounted to much. Shares have lost 99% of their value from their high point three years ago.\n\nHowever, the Roaring Kitty social media post brought the stock back to life, and a better-than-expected first-quarter earnings report helped it hold onto its value. The movie theater stock has more than doubled from its April lows.\n\nYet better-than-expected does not necessarily mean good or sustainable. AMC Entertainment is still hurting because the movie industry remains in decline. Theater attendance is down as Hollywood forgot how to make blockbuster movies. This summer\u2019s lineup started with a dud, and there are only one or two films that have hopes of hitting it big.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode well for AMC Entertainment going forward, making it the first meme stock to sell now.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) TRUTH SOCIAL application and logo displayed on smartphone. a social media application created by former US president Donald Trump after being blocked from Facebook. DJT stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) remain flat from where they were when the social media company of former President Donald Trump began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. Over the past month, though, the stock is down 30%. Expect it to continue being volatile.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the presidential campaign heats up heading into November\u2019s elections, investors are likely in for a roller coaster ride as the former president commands even more attention on the national stage. His Truth Social platform will be a key part of how Trump amplifies his message, which could determine whether it remains a viable business.\n\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t look good. Although Trump Media doesn\u2019t publish daily active user numbers, arguing they are not useful for a new platform, sites that track visits indicate usage is falling. While Trump has not really posted much on X (formerly Twitter), CEO Elon Musk will be hosting a town hall-style meeting with him on the platform. That draws attention away from Truth Social.\n\nUltimately, there is a very limited audience for the platform. Because of the president\u2019s polarizing personality, many won\u2019t use the site. It will primarily be for those committed to following Trump. While that\u2019s not necessarily bad, it also doesn\u2019t offer much hope for growth.\n\nAt $37 per share, there is a lot of air under Trump Media & Technology Group stock through which it can fall.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) An image of the logo for BlackBerry Ltd (BB).\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nOnce known for its revolutionary mobile handsets, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) is a very different company today. It is now a security and software business, which, though offering critical services, is a shell of its former self. It is experiencing growth but not on a scale necessary to take on its larger, better-financed rivals. There is a niche for BlackBerry stock to exist but not much to make an investment out of.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s main business is cybersecurity. It offers secure communications platforms, endpoint control systems and analytics tools and services. The company is very much in the same vein as CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), though on a dramatically smaller scale. It also tends to perform best in regulated markets, such as government, healthcare and financials, where security is paramount. But that could limit growth as well as expansion into other enterprise-class industries.\n\nBlackBerry also targets the auto industry with semiconductor, safety systems and cabin feature technologies. Despite its QNX operating system offering good growth prospects with original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and Tier 1 suppliers, it is the smaller of BlackBerry\u2019s two businesses.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s not a lot to expect from BlackBerry. It is a relatively small fish in a small pond. The stock is down 54% over the past year, and there do not appear to be any catalysts to reverse its course.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Can GameStop (NYSE:GME) Pull Off a Successful Turnaround?",
        "content": "In this article, I\u2019ll explain my neutral stance on GameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) stock and why I\u2019m skeptical about the company\u2019s potential to turn its business around from survival mode to something sustainable.\n\nThe video game retailer\u2019s shares have rallied strongly again as a meme stock following \u201cRoaring Kitty\u2019s\u201d return to social media and his significant bet on the company. GME\u2019s management capitalized on high volatility, raising billions through equity sales to strengthen its balance sheet and potentially turn around its core business.\n\nHowever, GameStop remains a meme stock, trading at a valuation disconnected from its fundamentals, squeezing short sellers in the process. This makes the stock more of a gamble than an investment, rendering it incredibly risky to take either a long or short position.\n\nThe \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d Effect\n\nSince 2020, GameStop has been trading like a meme stock, and one of the big reasons behind this is a central character called Keith Gill.\n\nBetter known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d Gill is an ordinary trader who became well known between 2020 and 2021 for spreading his unconventional investment thesis on GameStop stock, which was\u00a0being heavily shorted\u00a0at the time, via his YouTube channel. His digital influence led hundreds of thousands of retail investors and traders to bet on the company, resulting in massive short squeezes and triggering the so-called \u201cmeme frenzy,\u201d where, in addition to GME, several other heavily shorted stocks had sudden upticks in their trading performance as retail investors squeezed short sellers.\n\nAfter these episodes culminated in legal proceedings, Keith Gill had to testify before a jury, asserting no involvement in the alleged manipulation of GameStop\u2019s trading performance. He was subsequently cleared of\u00a0any\u00a0wrongdoing and has remained absent from social media since 2021. Since then, GameStop\u2019s stock trading performance has lost ground, experiencing a drawdown of about 85% until early this year.\n\nIn May of this year, Roaring Kitty returned to social media. Posting memes on X, he once again aroused a sentiment in retail investors to a degree not seen since 2021, and GameStop shares once again jumped triple digits in a few trading sessions.\n\nKeith Gill\u2019s return showed that he was not only back but also betting on GameStop stock again and betting big. Roaring Kitty updated his portfolio, disclosing holdings of over five million GameStop shares, 120,000 call options, and $29 million in cash, totaling approximately $210 million in assets. Later, he exercised his call options, increasing his stake to about nine million shares, while his cash position sits at around $6 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop Has a Lot of Cash Now\n\nDespite all of the buzz around the stock in the past few years, GameStop\u2019s business fundamentals\u00a0haven\u2019t changed much. The company\u2019s sales kept declining due to the shift towards digital gaming and increased spending on e-commerce, which further squeezed demand for brick-and-mortar retail. The executive\u2019s turnaround has continued to be a problem, although Ryan Cohen \u2014 the company\u2019s largest shareholder \u2014 stepped in as a Chairman of the board (and later CEO) and established a sense of ownership that\u00a0hadn\u2019t existed\u00a0before.\n\nToday, GameStop continues to have demand problems. However, the\u00a0issue of\u00a0possible illiquidity that haunted the company in the past has been put behind. That\u2019s because management (heavily influenced by Cohen) decided to take advantage of the hot demand for the stock with a massive equity offering that raised about $1.67 billion in 2021.\n\nWith this cash infusion, GameStop practically paid off all its debts and\u00a0managed to reach\u00a0a cash position of about $1 billion for a while, albeit with its core business revenues shrinking every year. Instead of using this cash position to invest in turning the company\u2019s business around and returning to growing (or at least stabilizing) revenues, GameStop has executed a drastic cost-cutting strategy, which has been successful. Fiscal 2024 (which ended January 2024) was the first time since Fiscal 2018 that the company didn\u2019t report a yearly net loss.\n\nBut it seems that with the return of Roaring Kitty to the scene, big fortunes came for GameStop once again. With the sudden appreciation of the company\u2019s share price in May, GameStop sold 45 million shares and raised $933 million in cash. And it didn\u2019t stop there.\n\nOn June 7, again after another massive surge, GameStop sold another 75 million shares, raising another $2.1 billion. Doing the math and incorporating this into the company\u2019s cash balance, GameStop has approximately $4 billion on its balance sheet with virtually no debt.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for GameStop?\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s management,\u00a0the money raised from the equity offering will be used\u00a0for general corporate purposes, which may include investments and acquisitions. In Q3 of last year, the company announced a change in its investment policy. Previously, it only allowed investments in fixed income, but now it permits investments in other types of equities under the guidance of Ryan Cohen and some of the board members.\n\nAlthough the company\u2019s management has provided little clarity on\u00a0future\u00a0plans,\u00a0it is likely that GameStop will\u00a0follow this path to diversify its business beyond brick-and-mortar stores, potentially investing in other\u00a0businesses\u00a0and becoming a kind of holding company.\n\nHowever, this strategy, which is somewhat ambiguous and carries significant execution risk, embodies GameStop\u2019s current investment thesis\u2014a wager on the capability of its management.\n\nIs GME Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAccording to Wall Street analyst Michael Pachter from Wedbush, who is the only analyst continuing to cover GameStop stock after it started trading like a meme stock, no one in the markets sees the company as a traditional investment but rather as a \u201cmomentum play.\u201d He points out that volatility has been exceptionally high and attributes the recent equity sales by GameStop\u2019s management to its significant overvaluation.\n\nPachter, who has held a bearish outlook on GME for an extended period, maintains his Sell rating on the stock, with an $11 price target, implying 61.7% downside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSince becoming a meme stock, GameStop has shifted from an investment thesis to a gamble driven by investor sentiment rather than fundamentals.\n\nDespite a recently strengthened balance sheet and engaged management, there\u00a0is no\u00a0clear plan for a fundamental turnaround.\u00a0The attraction is purely momentum-based.\n\nTrading on such momentum is risky, given\u00a0the\u00a0lack of correlation with fundamentals, making both\u00a0long and short positions highly speculative.\u00a0Therefore, I maintain a neutral stance on GameStop shares.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

Chief Executive Officer Ryan Cohen told investors he\u2019s focused on achieving profitability at the ailing video game retailer and plans to avoid the \u201chype\u201d that has buffeted the shares to extremes as part of the meme-stock frenzy.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan S&P 500 Hits 30th Record of 2024 as Megacaps Rally: Markets Wrap These Are the World\u2019s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds\u2019 Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid\n\n\u201cRevenue without profits and prospects of future cash flow are of no value to shareholders,\u201d Cohen said in brief remarks at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Monday, after it had been postponed following technical difficulties last week. \u201cThis means a smaller network of stores with an expanded assortment of higher-value items that fit into our trade-in model.\u201d\n\nThe Chewy Inc. co-founder has tried in recent years to pivot the company from a failing brick-and-mortar store into a digital storefront for the latest game releases and dabbled briefly in crypto-backed NFTs. But analysts don\u2019t see much of a future.\n\nDespite Cohen\u2019s background in online sales and a cadre of Amazon.com Inc. executives he hired \u2014 and then fired \u2014 GameStop\u2019s software revenue was down 30% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. A local GameStop store now looks just as much like a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us as a retailer for the latest Call of Duty. The shops are full of racks displaying Pokemon plushies, t-shirts and Funko pop figurines. But toy sales declined 20% from 2023. GameStop has closed dozens of locations, shuttered two distribution centers and laid off employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible business,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s going away. How does GameStop forestall the inevitable?\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Grapevine, Texas-based company unexpectedly reported first-quarter results that showed a wider adjusted loss than analysts expected and a 29% decline in sales. The company also announced a 75 million share sale program that raised $2.14 billion, capitalizing on a stock rally fueled by meme-stock trader Keith Gill. GameStop has now raised more than $3 billion over the past month via share sales as retail investors powered the stock higher.\n\nGill, who first achieved influencer fame in 2021, returned to X with a cryptic post on May 12. That fueled a 167% rise in GameStop shares through the close on June 6, adding $11 billion to its market value over that stretch. The stock was down 13% at 1:49 p.m. on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cQuestions really revolve around how it can successfully manage the de-scaling of its games store business while remaining profitable and finding adjacent opportunities to try and offset the decline,\u201d said Piers Harding-Rolls, research director for games at Ampere Analysis.\n\nThere are a few bright spots. Despite its strategic struggles, GameStop is swimming in cash that could help cover operating losses for several years. And when Sony Group Corp., Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp. release their next generation of video game consoles, GameStop will also likely see a boost.\n\n--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump\u2019s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn It Will Take More Than US Bargaining Power to Cut Drug Costs Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

A spokesperson for Computershare, the company hosting the webcast, pointed to \u201cunprecedented demand.\u201d\n\nThat only appeared to fuel anticipation in what the Grapevine, Texas-based company's leadership had to say.

Roaring Kitty returned to YouTube earlier this month, to tell his hordes of followers that he still believes GameStop\u2019s management team can turn the struggling company around following a disappointing earnings report.\n\nThere\u2019s a long way to go. Gamestop managed to narrow its losses in the first quarter, but its revenue fell as sales weakened for hardware and accessories, software and collectibles. Last week, GameStop also filed paperwork with securities regulators to sell up to 75 million shares of stock to raise proceeds of nearly $2.14 billion.\n\nView comments",

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nGameStop is expected to post a loss of $0.01 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +66.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +83.3%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.08 points to a change of +33.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +700%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.02 indicates a change of -75% from what GameStop is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -80%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GameStop is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GME _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of GameStop, the consensus sales estimate of $900 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -22.7%. The $4.13 billion and $3.7 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and -10.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $881.8 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.7%. EPS of -$0.12 for the same period compares with -$0.14 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $900 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.02%. The EPS surprise was -20%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, GameStop surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGameStop is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GameStop. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Cash Out Before the Crash: 3 Stocks to Sell in June",
        "content": "Since 2000, the stock market has had three major crashes. The first was the 2000 dot-com bubble, the second was the 2008 housing market crash and the third was the pandemic-induced crash in 2020. It\u2019s safe to say that anyone born in the last 30 years is no stranger to market crashes and the impact they have on investing. The task these days is more about knowing which stocks to sell before the crash bottoms them out.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s impossible to know when a crash will happen exactly. Thus, figuring out which unstable stocks to sell from your portfolio comes more from recognizing when a company\u2019s best days are behind it, rather than trying to get out as the market crashes. More often than not, taking a serious look at a company\u2019s balance sheet and evaluating some key ratios can give insight into how long that company has left before a crash.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a real estate investment trust (REIT), Realty Income (NYSE:O) is doubly exposed to the risks of a stock market crash alongside an economic recession. Though the company\u2019s primary focus is to provide an attractive dividend yield to long-term shareholders, it\u2019s not likely that many of its real estate holdings will continue to retain value in the event of a broader real estate market correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is because, for the first time in over a year, the bloated housing market did not see the average price of an American home increase. Rather sales are down as many buyers feel the squeeze of inflation on their purchasing power. Moreover, since Realty Income focuses so heavily on commercial real estate, the current interest rate environment is taking its toll on the company\u2019s assets and abilities to acquire more.\n\nAs a result, the company\u2019s net income was down 41.21% year-over-year for its first quarter of 2024. Depending on what causes the next market crash, stocks like Realty Income might be on the short list of stocks to sell for many institutional investors.\n\nGameStop (GME) The logo for GameStop Corp (GME) is displayed above a retail storefront entrance.\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, the meme rally that recently drove GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock through the roof has died down. Of course, most retail investors are aware by now of the risks of trying to time short squeezes and predict meme recurrences. However, for those still holding the stock, a market crash would be extra dangerous for a couple of different reasons.\n\nFirst, panic in the market would likely lead to a withdrawal of GameStop management from its investing positions. Second, retail investors who were in it for the fun might be more prone to liquidating their position as a form of protection. The resulting price drop might be so significant that it then undoes any of the gains from the stock\u2019s previous meme rallies.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, GME does not currently exhibit the financial performance or strength that would suggest it is capable of surviving a broader market crash. Thus, it\u2019s a no-brainer among stocks to sell.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere has never been a better time to sell Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock. I do not say that because the company is overvalued, but rather because of how intrinsically linked it has become with the broader tech economy. Its prowess in the design and fabless production of graphics processing units and data center components have made it a major player in the so-called artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nNvidia\u2019s success has transcended beyond its market capitalization and now impacts the Nasdaq and S&P 500 daily. However, with stocks, what goes up must come down, and eventually even NVDA stock will be subject to a correction. Thus, selling it now would allow for a lucrative play of buying back in after it dips.\n\nUltimately, buying the dip on a stock like NVDA would be a surefire way to maximize profits while decreasing the average cost per share for an investor. That\u2019s because even if you sell at its high point now, it will likely surpass it after the next dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "The Short Squeeze Saga: 3 Stocks Primed for an Epic Surge",
        "content": "Short squeeze stocks are garnering attention once again, thanks to the re-emergence of Keith Gill, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d a key figure in the original meme stock mania of 2020. The YouTube celebrity made a big investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock and returned after a three-year hiatus to spark the meme stock craze. Twenty thousand call options with a $20 strike price are about to expire, and five million common shares are included in this. GME jumped by more than 80% in pre-market trade as the markets reciprocated.\n\nAdditionally, AMC\u2019s (NYSE:AMC) stock has risen significantly, in part because of the renewed interest in meme stocks. The stock was still going up in early June, even though it had gone up 78% in one day in May, which led to renewed interest in short-squeeze stocks.\n\nBut, as we\u2019ll see, some short-squeeze stocks are companies that work in high-value fields, like the hydrogen fuel cell and plant-based food options sectors, working their way to navigate out of recent troubles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a prime candidate among short-squeeze stocks because it possesses all of the ingredients the meme stock community loves; it\u2019s down 73% in a year, operates in the highly lucrative hydrogen fuel industry, and isn\u2019t getting much analyst love.\n\nPLUG\u2019s sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $120.3 million, 42.8% less than the same time last year, and with a net loss of $295.77 million, PLUG is still not making any money.\n\nIn addition, Truist Securities recently cut its target price for PLUG from $6 to $3, while maintaining a \u201chold\u201d rating, adding to woes for a stock already down double digits this year with a short interest of 29.4%.\n\nPLUG, on the other hand, is actively trying to get more customers and funding in order to make good on analyst estimates and become profitable by 2026.\n\n\u200bThe Department of Energy is lending $1.66 billion to help construct six green hydrogen factory units. In addition, an unnamed \u201cmajor U.S. automobile manufacturer\u201d is working with Plug Power to provide fuel cells and build hydrogen infrastructure. Finally, PLUG is expanding its pipeline in the environmentally concerned continent of Europe by inking agreements for 350 megawatts of electrolyzers.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) A photograph of a vegetarian burger.\n\nSource: barmalini/Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is battling multiple fronts, with persistent inflation, a solitary rate cut this year, tough competition from Impossible Foods, and slowing plant-based meat revenues and volumes.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to all of the above, BYND also didn\u2019t do any favors for itself by reporting an 18% fall in net sales and a net loss of $155.1 million. Despite these hurdles, Beyond Meat expects sales of $315 million to $345 million in 2024, but investors are not biting; the stock is down almost 50% in the past year, and short interest is 39.8%.\n\nTo overcome these challenges and boost profitability, BYND is increasing the number of options on its menu. Recently, it revealed Beyond IV, its fourth-generation Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef.\n\nAvocado oil cuts saturated fat by 75% compared to beef (in these goods). They include 20% less salt and 21 grams of protein per serving. In addition, the Beyond Burger and Beyond Crispy Nuggets are two new products BYND has added to its food service line.\n\nApart from these product introductions, BYND is also working actively on inventory optimization, which is why Beyond Jerky is being discontinued to concentrate on Beyond IV, which is more lucrative. BYND is also slashing its 2024 budget by $70 million as part of the SKU rationalization process.\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of cannabinoid company Aurora Cannabis (ACB, blurred marijuana leaf (focus on left part of letter R in center)\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock.com\n\nAurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), much like other cannabis stocks, is a perennial name among short-squeeze stocks, primarily because, under federal law, marijuana is still illegal in America.\n\nOn the bright side, ACB reported its fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in its fiscal third quarter, thanks to quarterly net sales going up 5% to 64.4 million CAD. The Canadian licensed cannabis distributor is also cutting down on debt, recently repurchasing 23.1 million CAD in convertible debentures.\n\nAt the same time, not all is well, as revenue from consumer cannabis fell by 21% compared to last year, and adjusted SG&A expenses remained quite high at 27.5 million CAD in fiscal Q3 2024, which is under its 30 million CAD target.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a reverse stock split in February 2024 was supposed to consolidate shares and keep the price stable, but ACB stock is selling for $5.90, still a long way below its 52-week high of $11.5.\n\nCFO Glenn Ibbott also stepped down recently, though he\u2019s going to continue in an advisory role; following his departure, ACB stock fell once again.\n\nAll of these developments come as the Canadian market continues to face downward pressure, with recreational cannabis sales growing 2% in Q1 2024, down from 11% in the previous quarter, further ensuring ACB remains among short-squeeze stocks for some time to come.\u200b\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\n(Reuters) - GameStop's annual meeting, scheduled for Monday, is creating a growing buzz on social media among the company's host of avid retail investor fans.\n\nShares of the video game retailer have gyrated wildly over the last month after Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as Roaring Kitty who helped kick off meme stock mania in 2021, reappeared and later disclosed a large position in GameStop.\n\nMonday\u2019s annual general meeting scheduled for 12:30 p.m. ET comes after a planned meeting this week was adjourned due to a technical glitch resulting from high demand from shareholders wanting access to the online feed, according to a spokesperson for Computershare, which is hosting the online-only gathering.\n\n\"Unprecedented demand from shareholders wanting to access GameStop\u2019s Annual General Meeting led to a technical issue that prevented some investors from getting through, and the meeting was adjourned,\" Computershare said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear to analysts and investors which issues would be discussed at the meeting or whether Gill, who reiterated his bullish case for GameStop in a livestream earlier this month, would be present or online.\n\nThe company\u2019s last shareholder meeting in June 2023 took less than 15 minutes and included a brief statement from CEO Ryan Cohen.\n\nGameStop confirmed the technical glitch in a press release but did not respond to requests for further comment. Gill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThat has not stopped Roaring Kitty's fans from speculating on what the meeting could hold. Some created their own memes ahead of the meeting, with one posted on X showing Gill's image Photoshopped onto that of a rock star strutting onto a stage in front of a massive crowd.\n\nReuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the posts and the posters did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGill triggered the most recent wave of exuberance among retail investors after he disclosed ownership of 5 million GameStop shares and 120,000 June $20 strike call options in a screen shot posted on Reddit on June 2.\n\nGill updated his position on Thursday to show he now owns about 9 million shares and no options on the company. Gill may have sold all of his options contracts and bought shares or sold a part of his options holding and converted the rest into shares.\n\nGameStop's shares closed down 1% at $28.70 on Friday. They have gained 67% since May 10, the last trading day before Gill resurfaced on social media after a three-year absence.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee, additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies and David Gregorio)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "This Is Why Ryan Cohen Should Short GameStop Stock (if It Were Legal)",
        "content": "Thanks to the insanity of retail investors, GameStop (NYSE:GME) has raised $3 billion in GameStop stock over the past few weeks. It will probably be invested in other companies.\n\nWhether any of this makes any sense or not, the company\u2019s news release from June 11 confirmed that it generated $2.14 billion in gross proceeds from the latest at-the-market offering, selling 75 million shares at an average price of $28.49.\n\nPreviously, GameStop sold 45 million shares on May 24 at an average price of $20.74 for gross proceeds of $933.4 million. Based on an average 2% commission for ATMs and another 1% in expenses, GameStop\u2019s net proceeds to be invested are around $2.98 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI find it amazing that people will moan and groan about higher prices and interest rates and then go out and buy this awful, awful stock. Oh, well, you can\u2019t legislate against stupidity.\n\nI doubt Ryan Cohen is reading this, but if he is, here\u2019s why he should short GameStop stock. In addition, I\u2019ve got two companies he should buy if he\u2019s serious about becoming a portfolio manager.\n\nShorting GameStop Stock\n\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s legal for a CEO and their board to short their own stock. At least, not in the U.S., but if it were, Ryan Cohen would be wise to do so.\n\nFor all the bulls out there who floated GameStop stock $3 billion at inflated prices, you must see the writing on the wall. This tired video game retailer, whose plan by its savior to go digital, has gone nowhere fast.\n\nOnly job cuts, as I suggested in my last piece about GME, have done anything to improve its financial condition.\n\nAs a result, the board has capitulated with Cohen, approving his role of portfolio manager in March, to be overseen by two independent directors.\n\nGiven GME finished Q1 2024 with $1.08 billion in cash, Cohen will have more than $4 billion to put to work in the GameStop investment portfolio.\n\nIt won\u2019t be in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK.B) league but it will be a decently-sized equity portfolio nonetheless.\n\nInvestors have trusted Cohen to make changes to GameStop\u2019s business since he first invested in the company in August 2020, becoming the \u201cofficial\u201d CEO last September.\n\nWe\u2019re coming up on four years of his involvement with no improvements to the business or its business strategy.\n\nAnd now, investors believe he can pick stocks like Warren Buffett? Hardly.\n\nInvest in the Best\n\nI have no doubt that Ryan Cohen is a bright fellow. He was wise enough to sell Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) for $3.35 billion while the business was on an upward trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the five years since Chewy went public on June 13, 2019, its share price has gained 6%, a compound annual growth rate of 1.1%.\n\nSo, he knows when to sell, but does he know when to buy? Some would argue that starting Chewy at the beginning of the long-term secular trend for pet products was a prescient choice.\n\nI do concede that. However, investing in stocks requires a different set of skills from entrepreneurship.\n\nWhich is why Cohen would be wise to put a lion\u2019s share of GME\u2019s cash into Berkshire.\n\nAssuming he dropped the entire $4 billion into BRK.B, GameStop would be the 15th-largest owner of Class B shares, ahead of Legal & General Group (OTCMKTS:LGGNY) and behind Norges Bank, Norway\u2019s central bank, and manager of the Government Pension Fund Global.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal. And they kind of know what they\u2019re doing in Omaha.\n\nLuxury Will Always Survive and Mostly Thrive\n\nBernard Arnault is the second-wealthiest person on the planet according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index at $206 billion. Down $1.14 billion in 2024, the luxury market has taken a breather.\n\nHowever, if Cohen had been in a position to invest $4 billion in LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) at the beginning of 2014, GME would have $17.3 billion to invest, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%.\n\nThe 75-year-old has moved in recent years to ensure there is an orderly succession at the family business. In 2022, LVMH raised the retirement age for its CEO by five years to 80.\n\nHe\u2019s now got five additional years to position the chess pieces that are his five children who run various businesses under LVMH\u2019s umbrella.\n\nOn June 6, Arnault promoted his second-youngest child, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, to be Managing Director of Financi\u00e8re Agache, the Arnault\u2019s family holding company.\n\nThe holding company has 48% of the equity and 64% of the voting rights in LVMH. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric joined the LVMH board in April.\n\nIn Q1 2024, LVMH had revenue of 20.69 billion euros ($22.22 billion), 2% lower year-over-year on a reported basis, but 3% higher, excluding acquisitions and currency. In 2023, its revenue was 86.2 billion ($92.58 billion) with an operating profit of 22.8 billion euros ($24.49 billion).\n\nCohen could do a lot worse than these two hands-off investments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty\u2019s $262 Million Stirs Skeptics in Meme Stock Era",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- As a renewed bout of GameStop Corp. fever gripped the meme-stock faithful, fans of trading influencer Keith Gill waited for one moment: The day their hero, aka \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d aka \u201cDeep F\u2014-ing Value,\u201d would become a billionaire.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSouthwest Plane Plunged Within 400 Feet of Ocean Near Hawaii Flesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan Wells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Yes, Everyone Really Is Sick a Lot More Often After Covid Beaches on Singapore\u2019s Sentosa Island Hit By Oil Spill\n\nThe notion was hardly far-fetched. Over the course of two weeks, Gill had been posting images of a massive stake in GameStop and its call options in a portfolio that peaked at more than $550 million on June 6. Though he\u2019s added even more stock since then, the dollar value of his holdings has dropped along with the company\u2019s shares.\n\nWith the stock little changed since the early days of its latest mania, a new kind of anxiety is building among Wall Street and retail traders alike.\n\nThe original 2021 GameStop rally shook the idea of short-selling to its core \u2014 eroding the appeal of betting against a floundering company when you can wind up feeling the wrath of Redditors. This time around, the existential question is about what counts as market manipulation.\n\nDoes posting a meme, potentially delivering an instant profit, violate the spirit of free and fair markets? Has the David versus Goliath nature of meme stocks shifted? What if Roaring Kitty is the Goliath? And how exactly did he build a position bigger than Charles Schwab Corp.\u2019s?\n\n\u201cThe original meme stock craze was us versus them, with \u2018them\u2019 being the guys who would short-sell millennials\u2019 favorite companies like GameStop,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure who \u2018them\u2019 is anymore.\u201d\n\nGill didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment.\n\nLosing Charm\n\nThe populist ringleader of a short squeeze that shook Wall Street in the original 2021 meme-stock rally, Gill is losing his folksy charm, at least for some followers. Trading firms and even some former fans are eying Gill with more suspicion, as Redditors pose questions like: \u201cHow is Roaring Kitty coming back not a basic pump and dump scheme?\u201d\n\nBy Thursday, Gill\u2019s brokerage account snapshots suggested he\u2019d unwound an earlier position of 120,000 call options and added more GameStop, upping his portfolio to about 9 million shares of the video game retailer, worth more than $262 million. (Gill\u2019s final post of 2021 showed he had 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million; GameStop did a four-for-one stock split in July 2022.)\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Gill\u2019s actions sent the price soaring again, GameStop seized on the volatility to sell more than $2 billion worth of stock.\n\nAll told, anyone who bought shares over the past month and held was about as likely to lose money as profit. To some, one major difference is hedge funds and other sophisticated investors have adapted from three years ago and are likely to come out ahead \u2014 at the expense of Gill\u2019s retail-trading fans.\n\n\u201cSome of the quantitative managers have models to look at the trends in price and those models are extremely quick to get out of the stock if they see significant downside volatility,\u201d said Don Steinbrugge, chief executive officer of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. \u201cAt some point retail investors are going to wise up and realize there\u2019s a lot of danger.\u201d\n\nManipulation Concerns\n\nThe episode brought to the fore questions of what constitutes market manipulation. The Wall Street Journal reported Morgan Stanley-owned brokerage E*Trade was considering barring Gill from its platform over such concerns, after previously banning other popular personalities like Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder who streams as Davey Day Trader and said he got kicked off of the brokerage.\n\nA spokesman for E*Trade declined to comment.\n\nWhat\u2019s singular about Gill\u2019s case is that market manipulation typically involves pushing a price higher to profit off the stock movement, said Craig Marcus, a partner and co-chair of the capital markets group at law firm Ropes & Gray. If Gill\u2019s snapshots are real, that hasn\u2019t obviously been the case, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with his thesis about the value of the stock, but if all he\u2019s doing is executing on his thesis and not doing manipulative things to profit,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to prove ill intent, Marcus said in an interview.\n\nTo be sure, Gill was accused of using his clout to manipulate prices even three years ago when he first arrived on the public stage. In 2021, a lawsuit against Gill and MassMutual alleged he was manipulating markets with his outsize influence on certain stocks.\n\n\u201cThree years ago this was funny,\u201d said Peter Atwater, an adjunct professor of economics at William & Mary. \u201cPeople have become more bothered by this than amused by it, and that to me is an indication that it is unlikely that this behavior will be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nWhen Gill scheduled a highly anticipated return to YouTube on June 6 without details of what he\u2019d talk about, the stock shot up nearly 50%, adding $16 billion to its market value in a matter of hours.\n\nIn the livestream, which garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers, Gill vamped for about an hour against the backdrop of GameStop\u2019s violently fluctuating share price. He seemed to sense the possibility he\u2019d draw more scrutiny from fans, regulators and trading professionals.\n\n\u201cDo I have to be careful what I say here?\u201d he asked.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGrieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War How to Cool Down Parks in Hot Cities The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 7 Best Under $20 Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The May inflation readings showed cooling consumer and producer prices. However, in 2024, it\u2019s important to define the meaning of words. In this case \u201ccooling\u201d doesn\u2019t mean prices are going down. Rather, the rate at which they\u2019re going up is slowing. That thesis is causing some analysts to believe stocks could be ready for a summer rally. If so, why not get more bang for your buck with the best under $20 stocks to buy?\n\nAn important thing to remember about Investor psychology is that experienced investors have a long-term outlook. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone is a Warren Buffett. Rather, they look past today\u2019s headlines and take educated guesses about what those headlines will mean for stocks 6 to 12 months down the road \u2014 or further.\n\nRight now, it means inflation is at a point that will keep interest rates, at worst, where they are. But as long as they know the next move is lower, stocks could be a good buy. Here are seven of the best under $20 stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigitalBridge (DBRG) Real estate investment trust (REIT) on a black notebook on an office desk.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA common characteristic of the companies on this list of the best under $20 stocks to buy is a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio below the S&P 500 average of around 25x. But I\u2019m making an exception with DigitalBridge (NYSE:DBRG), which trades at about 40x forward earnings.\n\nThe reason is that this real estate investment trust (REIT) specializes in data centers. According to the research firm Dell\u2019Oro Group, data center physical infrastructure revenue grew by 16% year-over-year (YOY) in 2023. And the group notes that much of this growth is coming as pandemic-fueled backlogs are being filled, not from generative AI\u2026yet.\n\nDigitalBridge plans to build five times the number of data centers it\u2019s built in the last 30 years to keep up with this explosive demand. It\u2019s important to note that the company already has the third-largest independent global data center footprint.\n\nSo, why is DBRG down 25% in 2024? That comes from the company\u2019s March earnings report that showed net losses growing and high executive compensation. This is an issue of scale, but if the company achieves that, its Fee-Earning Equity Under Management (FEEUM) business model makes the business and the stock very attractive.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY)\n\nSource: Nintendo\n\nI was reminded of Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) when I put together a list of the best under $20 stocks to buy in May. The recent hubbub around GameStop (NYSE:GME) compels me to keep it on this list.\n\nI\u2019m aware that many investors holding GME stock with diamond hands don\u2019t want to hear about fundamentals. But it has to be said that GameStop is analog in a digital world.\n\nStory continues\n\nA better speculative investment is Nintendo. The company has delayed the launch of its next version of its popular Switch console until 2025. That\u2019s why NTDOY stock has been under pressure recently.\n\nThat may be a disappointment for gamers hoping to have a new device for the holidays. However, the company is still anticipating sales of over 15.5 million units in 2024. Nevertheless, with the current version being seven years old, now is an opportunity for investors to buy shares before the refresh cycle hits.\n\nThe consensus price of the 20 analysts that have issued a price target for Nintendo stock is $58.43. That\u2019s a 340.63% gain from the stock\u2019s closing price on June 13.\n\nKinder Morgan (KMI) Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nYet another stock that I\u2019m reprising from my May list is Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI). At the risk of sounding like a broken clock, the bullish thesis remains the eventuality of rising oil prices. OPEC+ is pledging to maintain its output cuts. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Biden administration has been drawing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) it has only recently begun to replenish.\n\nNeither one of those issues has anything to do with steady consumer demand, which is likely to remain in place as an electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure is not in place on a national scale. And there\u2019s also the demand increase that will come when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.\n\nAll this oil has to move around the country and that means it will likely flow through the company\u2019s 80,000 miles of pipelines and approximately 180 terminals throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re waiting for the oil market to turn around, taking a long position in KMI stock lets you collect the company\u2019s high-yield (5.82%) dividend that currently pays $1.15 annually per share.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Kenvue (KVUE) logo displayed on smartphone with company website in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the company formed when Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) spun off its consumer products division. The company is now home to many of the iconic JNJ brands, including the baby powder that was the subject of a long-running lawsuit.\n\nWhile Kenvue\u2019s indemnity agreement, secured from J&J as part of the spinoff, shields it from talc liability that arises in North America, it\u2019s not entirely off the legal hook. Still, it does mean that recent settlement orders won\u2019t hit Kenvue\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThe key reason why KVUE stock is down 28% in the 12 months since the spinoff is its miss on the top line in its last two earnings reports. There is some evidence that consumers, particularly low- to middle-income consumers, are switching to private-label store brands.\n\nHowever, approximately two-thirds of those consumers are\u00a0doing so to offset inflation. As long as that\u2019s the case, this could be a headwind that will resolve itself. Analysts seem to believe that and are offering a consensus price target of $22.38 for KVUE stock. And while you wait, you can collect a dividend with a 4.44% yield.\n\nBarrick Gold (GOLD) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe last of the stocks that I had on a list of best under $20 stocks to buy in May is Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). My thesis remains the same. Inflation is cooling, but disinflation is not deflation, and therefore, the bull market in gold should continue to roll on.\n\nTo date, mining stocks such as Barrick Gold haven\u2019t been participating in gold\u2019s surge. Much of that is because, like oil drillers, gold mining companies have to ramp up operations to meet production targets.\n\nBarrick is pledging to ramp up production by 30% by 2030. To do that, it must have confidence that the underlying metal, in this case gold, is going to stay at elevated levels. And you also shouldn\u2019t forget about copper, which will be required for the electrification economy being built around the world.\n\nGOLD stock has been range-bound for the last year and is down 6% overall as of the market close on June 13. But analysts see GOLD stock moving up to 36% higher with a consensus price target of $21.91.\n\nCleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) logo on an iPhone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Biden administration announced it would protect the U.S. steel industry by maintaining and increasing tariffs on steel and aluminum put in place by the Trump administration. That will be bullish for domestic steel manufacturers such as Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF).\n\nCLF stock is down approximately 27% in 2024. Much of that has to do with the noise around the company. It made a bid to buy U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) that was rejected. It missed the top line when it reported first-quarter revenue. And the company still has an acquisition itch to scratch, which it may have done for now by buying the U.S. plants of NLMK, Russia\u2019s largest steel producer.\n\nSteel prices have been elevated as inflation has increased. With demand expected to rise due to the need for infrastructure, the short-term outlook for CLF stock is strong. Trading at around 18x forward earnings, the stock isn\u2019t overly valued compared to the broader market.\n\nJoby Aviation (JOBY) Smartphone with logo of American eVTOL company Joby Aviation on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor purely speculative investors, one of the best under $20 stocks to buy may be Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY). The company recently achieved a key milestone when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued its final airworthiness criteria for Joby.\n\nIt\u2019s not an approval, but it provides clarity on what Joby must do to receive that approval. It also keeps Joby ahead of its competition in the United States. Plus, the company already has deals in place that could have it begin commercial operations in the UAE as soon as 2025.\n\nAnd from an investment standpoint, investors have to be encouraged by the $900 million in cash on Joby\u2019s balance sheet. That all but ensures it can make it into production without diluting shareholder value.\n\nJOBY stock is down 36% in the last 12 months and 24% in 2024 alone. At a price of $5 per share as of June 13, the stock is still a penny stock. It doesn\u2019t appear it will be that way much longer. There\u2019s time to scale into JOBY stock gradually, but it\u2019s one you may need to act on sooner rather than later before the biggest gains fly away.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A manic two-week stretch for GameStop Corp. investors \u2014 featuring an annual meeting kiboshed by a technical glitch and the company\u2019s most visible stockholder shaking up his portfolio \u2014 has the stock price essentially back where it started.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Tesla Investors Get Behind Musk\u2019s Fight for $56 Billion Pay Deal Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Bump Stock Ban Tossed Out by Supreme Court in Gun-Rights Win Luxury Labels Slash Prices 50% to Lure Wary Chinese Shoppers\n\nShares of the video-game retailer, which are up 20% since the start of the month, have seen double-digit percentage swings in each of the last 10 sessions. While that kind of volatility is somewhat par for the course in the world of meme stocks, GameStop\u2019s catalysts were anything but typical. Take Thursday, when the shares jumped 14% despite technical difficulties forcing thousands of GameStop speculators to find unofficial Twitch, X and YouTube streams to tune into a meeting that was eventually adjourned before it really began.\n\nRead: \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Appears to Have Exited GameStop Call Options\n\nWithin hours of the postponement, Keith Gill \u2014 the meme-stock investor known online as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2014 posted a screenshot showing that he exited his 120,000 call options while adding to a heap of shares. The post on Reddit, where Gill is known as \u201cDeep F\u2014-ing Value,\u201d showed Gill no longer held GameStop call options that were set to expire next week and had a strike price of $20. Instead, the screenshot showed he had more than nine million common shares, up from five million on Monday, a position worth some $250 million based on Friday\u2019s trading, and one that would put him among the company\u2019s biggest holders.\n\nOf course, when it comes to meme stocks, the retail crowd is key. Indeed, individual investors\u2019 adoration of GameStop Chief Executive Officer Ryan Cohen has driven others to jump in after Gill or double down on their own bets. With Gill\u2019s options unloaded, the contract with the highest open interest on Friday was a $128 call that needs the stock to more than quadruple to come in the money by the end of the session.\n\nIterations of that contract have been in vogue for weeks, ever since Gill\u2019s return on social media platforms X, Reddit and YouTube. Hundreds of thousands of loyal followers flocked to his livestream last week where he promoted his GameStop holdings and faith in Cohen. Meanwhile, shareholders must wait until Monday to attend the company\u2019s delayed meeting.\n\nStory continues\n\nExcitement surrounding GameStop has been apparent with how heavily it\u2019s been trading in recent weeks. More than 570 million shares changed hands this week, which is down slightly from last week\u2019s more than three-year high of 776 million. But it still marks a sixth week of volume that\u2019s more than double what\u2019s been typical since the original meme craze fizzled.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of outstanding call options skyrocketed to its highest level in two years as traders take on leveraged bets that shares might just launch higher.\n\nFor all the maneuvering, GameStop shares are trading around $28 at midday Friday, roughly where they were at the end of trading two weeks ago. In between, the stock has seen double-digit percentage swings in its last 10 sessions. And the company has used those moves to sell shares and shore up its balance sheet. This week, it completed an offering that raised $2.14 billion, and over the past month it has brought more than $3 billion in new capital.\n\nGameStop\u2019s improved cash position drove skeptics like Andrew Left to close their bearish bets. But pundits are still questioning what\u2019s next for the retailer that has continually seen sales decline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear GameStop is less about fundamentals,\u201d said Rohan Reddy, director of research at Global X Management. \u201cThis all points to an enhanced state of euphoria.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\n\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in GameStop (GME) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to GME for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nGameStop's Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at GameStop's main business drivers.\n\nHeadquartered in Grapevine, TX, GameStop Corp. is the world's largest video game retailer. The company offers the best selection of new and pre-owned video gaming consoles, accessories and video game titles, in both physical and digital formats. Through all its channels, the company sells various types of digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital, prepaid subscription cards and digitally downloadable software as well as collectible products. The company also publishes Game Informer, the world\u2019s largest print and digital video game publication featuring reviews of new title releases, game tips and news regarding current developments in the video game industry. It also operates PowerUp Rewards program. The company operates business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s products are categorized as follows:\r\n\r\nHardware and Accessories (57.3% of first quarter fiscal 2024 sales): GameStop offers new and pre-owned video game platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 4 (2013), Microsoft Xbox One (2013) and the Nintendo Switch (2017). Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products and memory cards.\r\n\r\nSoftware (27.2% of Sales): The company provides new and pre-owned video game software for current and certain prior generation consoles. It also sells a wide variety of in-game digital currency and digital downloadable content.\r\n\r\nCollectibles (15.5% of Sales): The category consists of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the video game, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes, which are sold through the company\u2019s video game store and e-commerce properties, and ThinkGeek and Zing Pop Culture stores.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in GameStop ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2014 would be worth $3,148.96, or a gain of 214.90%, as of June 14, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\n\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 180.65% and gold's return of 73.20% over the same time frame.\n\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for GME.\n\nGameStop's stock has outperformed the industry in the past six months. GameStop has been progressing well with its growth endeavors while maintaining a sturdy balance sheet. It has been taking initiatives to diversify its business and become a more technology-driven firm. GameStop has also been pursuing opportunities in cryptocurrency, nonfungible tokens and Web 3.0 gaming verticals. However, the downturn in sales within the collectibles category highlights ongoing struggles and the decline in hardware, accessories, and software sales suggests a shift in consumer preferences toward digital formats, signaling a continued drop in demand for physical gaming products. Also, the stock seems overpriced relative to industry norms, as evident from its price-to-sales ratio, suggesting a possible overvaluation in light of its business fundamentals.\n\nShares have gained 5.24% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Does Roaring Kitty have grander plans than simply making a boatload of money with his GameStop trades? Might he be angling to exert actual influence over the brick-and-mortar retailer\u2019s ongoing transformation by demanding a seat on the board?\n\nOn Thursday, the meme stock trader extraordinaire, aka Keith Gill, posted an\u00a0update to Reddit showing he has made $58 million so far since first revealing his position in the company at the start of this month.\n\nBut Gill's loyal band of small GameStop shareholders, whose business selling physical copies of video games threatens to be crushed by the shift towards cloud gaming, saw a hidden message.\n\nRoaring Kitty pulling up to the next GameStop board meeting pic.twitter.com/GVmxdlBTxN\n\n\u2014 wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) June 14, 2024\n\nOne week ago Gill was poised to become a\u00a0billionaire on paper during his first livestream in three years, just one day before turning 38 years old.\n\nGameStop chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen foiled his plans that very day, showering the market with 75 million newly issued shares\u2014a 20% capital increase\u2014to\u00a0rake in $2 billion, tanking the stock in the process.\n\nIn a joke, Gill later appeared on the stream with his right arm in a sling and a bandage wrapped around his head, laughing off the misfortune and downing a beer to celebrate his birthday. But with his latest trade, the jokester known for communicating through pop culture memes may now have sent a very serious message to Cohen.\n\nIn a screenshot posted to Reddit, where he goes by the name DeepFu\u2014ingValue, Gill finally revealed the answer to the biggest question everyone wanted to know: what would he do with the 120,000 call options that were due to expire if not exercised by June 21.\n\nJudging from the evidence he wanted everyone to see, it appeared as if Gill had closed out his entire position by the end of trading yesterday, liquidating 79,990 contracts while taking delivery of the rest in stock.\n\nHowever he managed it, his holdings went from precisely 5 million shares, where they had been since the very first Reddit post earlier this month, to 9,001,000 shares\u2014no more, no less.\n\nGamestop investors were quick to point out this wasn\u2019t by accident, nor was it a coincidence. This seemingly random figure equated exactly to the number of shares owned by GameStop CEO Cohen when he\u00a0announced in a December 2020 SEC filing that he had raised his GameStop stake to 12.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nA month later, the Chewy co-founder was on the board of the company. That very year George Sherman vacated his position as CEO and by late last year, the activist investor Cohen was named chairman and CEO.\n\nSome believe this oblique reference to Cohen may explain a meme Gill posted earlier this week from\u00a0The Office, in which the fictional Michael Scott wears a short-sleeved shirt from whose pocket a kitty is poking out. In it a younger, awkward looking Scott is meeting his boss\u2014potentially a sly homage to the GameStop chair and chief executive (who is actually Gill\u2019s same age).\n\npic.twitter.com/Ydduqqw0dC\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) June 12, 2024\n\nWhile Gill may have the same number of shares as Cohen did back then, he doesn\u2019t have the same influence. That\u2019s because the retailer has since executed a 4-to-1 stock split along with two recent at-the-market offerings that combined inflated the shares in circulation by nearly 40%, or 120 million.\n\nAccording to a filing this week, Cohen has let his 12% stake from April be diluted to just 8.6% as of\u00a0June 10. By comparison, Gill\u2019s screenshot suggests he controls 2.1% of the shares.\n\nGameStop is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday. It was scheduled for yesterday, but it adjourned as soon as it began due to technical difficulties.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t respond to request from\u00a0Fortune for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

This is a critical analysis of three prominent stocks. These firms are now in trouble and might put the stability of your portfolio at risk. These businesses\u2019 serious operational and financial losses are all too apparent from their sharp drops in revenue and persistent performance problems. Despite their attempts to cut expenses, declining revenues and ongoing profitability issues still plague these businesses. Thus, identifying these stocks to sell is crucial for safeguarding capital in uncertain markets.\n\nMoreover, they deal with a multi-year pattern of dropping sales for major brands, which indicates enduring consumer engagement problems. Similarly, it is difficult to reach sales goals when there are gaps in the market strategy and customer attractiveness. To protect their capital from market declines, investors must understand the underlying issues these stocks are facing. By recognizing and selling weak stocks in advance, they can avoid future investing losses as economic risks loom.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) leads in retail consumer electronics and video games. The company derived net sales of $0.882 billion during Q1 2024, a solid drop from $1.237 billion for Q1 2023. This $355 million drop, or around 28.7%, is a severe top-line decline. Certainly, declining sales are a serious worry since they might signify fundamental issues. These are failure to retain consumers, deriving value, drop in market share, or progressively competing in the sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs decreased from $345.7 million in Q1 2023 to\u00a0$295.1 million in Q1 2024. However, SG&A costs uplifted from 27.9% to 33.5% of the top line. , the SG&A ratio has increased, indicating cost structure inefficiencies deriving in top-line. Following this, GameStop continues to be unprofitable. Its net loss decreased from $50.5 million in Q1 2023 to $32.3 million in Q1 2024. Even if the company\u2019s loss position has improved, net losses continue to prevail.\n\nOverall, the transition to digital downloads and online sales has presented GameStop with several difficulties, which may justify its listing on the stocks to sell list.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) sells upscale cookware and home accessories. Maintaining customer engagement and sales momentum across its brands is a fundamental problem, as seen by the persistent reduction in comparable brand revenue over several years. In Q1 2024, the firm reported a 4.9% fall in comparable brand revenue.\u00a0This\u00a0comes after a 10.9% two-year loss in similar brand revenue and a 1.4% three-year decline in comparable brand revenue. Further, in Q1, Pottery Barn \u2014 a crucial brand in the Williams-Sonoma portfolio \u2014 saw a vital decline in comparable brand revenue of 10.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in Q1, several\u00a0major\u00a0brands saw negative comparable brand revenues, including West Elm (-4.1%) and Pottery Barn (-10.8%). Despite modest improvement from quarter to quarter, the general downward tendency remains. In contrast, positive comps were recorded by Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn Kids, showing uneven performance throughout the portfolio. The fall in popularity of staple brands like\u00a0West Elm and Pottery Barn highlights a serious problem with preserving these companies\u2019 allure and relevancy.\n\nIn short, Williams-Sonoma\u2019s revenue decreases have been considerable in the face of economic uncertainty, which has raised worries and elevated the stock to a sell position.\n\nBig Lots (BIG) Photo of a Big Lots (BIG) store shot from the parking lot with a shopping cart in the foreground and clear blue sky in the background. BIG stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig Lots (NYSE:BIG) is a discount retailer offering a\u00a0wide\u00a0product range. Comparable sales trends for big lots in Q1 2024 were down 9.9%, much below the projection of mid-single-digit declines. This considerable drop in sales points to a serious flaw in the business\u2019s capacity to hit sales goals. The actual result was far worse than the company\u2019s anticipated mid-single-digit decrease. This indicates poor sales forecasting and misjudgment on the part of the market.\n\nAdditionally, the overall consumer climate had a detrimental effect on the company\u2019s success. There is a reduction in consumer spending, particularly on expensive discretionary products. At the macro level, there is\u00a0a drop in consumer confidence due to interest rate increases, and\u00a0inflation and unemployment are\u00a0major\u00a0problems. Even though 70% of Big Lots locations have positive 4-wall adjusted EBITDA, some are underperforming. Since a sizable percentage of stores are underperforming, drastic measures are required to resolve these problems.\n\nWith all that, Big Lots has faced considerable challenges in maintaining an edge. These issues have raised concerns about its performance going forward, and these fundamental downsides make it a top mark on the stocks to sell list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Tesla shareholders back Musk pay package, Adobe's outlook - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday, after a streak of record high closes for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stretched into a fourth straight session. In a victory for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, the electric carmaker's shareholders approved his $56 billion pay package. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares spike in extended hours trading after the Photoshop-maker lifts its annual financial guidance.\n\n1. Futures mixed\n\nU.S. futures were hovering around both sides of the flatline on Friday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered yet another record closing high in the prior session despite the Federal Reserve tempering some investor hopes for interest rate cuts this year.\n\nBy 03:37 ET (07:37 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract had edged down by 4 points or 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures had gained 33 points or 0.2%, and Dow futures had slipped by 101 points or 0.3%.\n\nFollowing the bell on Thursday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite stood at fresh all-time highs for the fourth consecutive session, boosted in part by a Labor Department report showing an unexpected month-on-month decline in producer prices in May.\n\nThe data helped to soothe some market jitters around the Fed's updated policy projections earlier in the week, which signaled that the central bank now expects to reduce rates just once in 2024. In March, officials at the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee had forecast three.\n\n2. Tesla shareholders approve Musk pay deal\n\nTesla shareholders have voted in favor of Chief Executive Elon Musk's $56 billion compensation package and the electric vehicle giant's reincorporation in Texas from Delaware.\n\nThe decision, which was announced by the company at an event in Texas on Thursday, was fueled in part by Musk's strong support from retail investors who have praised him for spearheading Tesla's past advances despite more recent worries over its flagging sales and stock price.\n\nTheir backing helped to offset vocal opposition from several institutional investors and proxy groups who had flagged concerns over the size of the pay deal -- the largest in U.S. corporate history.\n\nTesla's move to reincorporate in Texas also comes after a judge in Delaware voided Musk's pay package earlier this year, which drew the ire of the billionaire. Despite this week's approval, an ongoing appeal of the judge's ruling is projected to continue for months.\n\n3. Adobe lifts annual guidance\n\nAdobe raised its annual earnings guidance after the Photoshop-maker reported better-than-expected second-quarter results, sending shares in California-based firm surging by over 14% in extended hours trading.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the three months ended May 31, Adobe reported adjusted earnings of $4.48 a share on revenue of $5.31 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had forecast $4.39 and $5.29 billion, respectively.\n\n\"\u201cOur highly differentiated approach to AI and innovative product delivery are attracting an expanding universe of customers and providing more value to existing users,\u201d said CEO Shantanu Narayen in a statement.\n\nAs a result, the company is now predicting that full-year earnings per share will be between $18.00 and $18.20, while revenue is projected in a range of $21.40 billion to $21.50 billion. It had previously forecast per-share income of $17.60 to $18 and revenue of $21.30 billion to $21.50 billion for its 2024 fiscal year.\n\n4. Roaring Kitty appears to almost double GameStop (NYSE:GME) holdings\n\nKeith Gill, the investor known online as \"Roaring Kitty\", appeared to have raised his holdings of video game retailer and meme stock darling GameStop's common stock, according to a screenshot he shared on social media site Reddit.\n\nIn the screenshot, Gill seemed to have owned just over 9 million shares in the company, up from 5 million earlier this week, and more than $6 million in cash.\n\nGill's update, which came after the close of trading on Thursday, amounted to 2.1% of GameStop's 426 million outstanding shares, according to a recent regulatory filing cited by Reuters.\n\nHe also seemed to no longer own the 120,000 strike call options he had previously disclosed in his return to Reddit on June 2 following a three-year absence from the website.\n\n5. Oil slips, but remains on pace for strong week\n\nCrude prices retreated Friday, but were on course for their best week in more than two months on increased hopes for demand growth this year.\n\nBy 03:37 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.5% lower at $78.23 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.3% to $82.48 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks were up over 3% this week -- the best week since April 5.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries stuck to a forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand for 2024, overshadowing a more bearish report by the International Energy Agency. Additionally, influential investment bank Goldman Sachs forecast solid U.S. fuel demand this summer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla shareholders back Musk pay package, Adobe's outlook - what's moving markets\n\nIndia's May wholesale prices rose 2.61% Y/Y, most in over a year\n\nIndonesia central bank intervenes to defend faltering rupiah\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Keith Gill \u2014 the meme-stock investor known online as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2014 purports to have exited his entire options position in GameStop Corp. while adding to his heap of shares.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for \u2018Simulation of Keyboard Activity\u2019 Apple to \u2018Pay\u2019 OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad\u2019s Reaction Was Remarkable. US Producer Prices Surprise With Biggest Decline Since October Tech Powers Stocks as Adobe Surges in Late Trading: Markets Wrap\n\nA screenshot on Gill\u2019s Reddit account on Thursday showed his portfolio no longer included the 120,000 GameStop call options that were set to expire next week and had a strike price of $20. Instead, his portfolio showed a position of more than nine million common shares, up from five million earlier this week.\n\nThe screenshot, under Gill\u2019s Reddit handle \u201cDeepF\u2014-ing Value,\u201d appears to show a cash position that dipped to $6.3 million from nearly $30 million on Monday. That implies Gill may have used some of the cash to add to his stake of common shares.\n\nThe calls traded roughly 142,000 times on Wednesday and Thursday. By the end of Wednesday\u2019s session, the number of outstanding contracts had already dropped 34% to 111,818.\n\nThe $20 calls, which closed at $6.40 Wednesday, traded between $6 and $9.80 Thursday as GameStop shares rose 14% to $29.12. That leaves the options above Gill\u2019s purported average purchase price of $5.6754.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he sold 80,000 calls and exercised 40,000,\u201d said Danny Kirsch, head of options at Piper Sandler & Co. \u201cSo now he\u2019s long nine million shares based on the screenshots circulating on Reddit.\u201d\n\nThe surge in trading came with GameStop scheduled to hold a shareholder meeting on Thursday. However, the meeting was postponed due to technical difficulties with the livestream, according to the company.\n\nNews of Gill\u2019s position and his highly-anticipated return to YouTube last week nearly doubled GameStop\u2019s share price to over $45. The company capitalized on the rally by selling $2.14 billion of shares to raise cash. With the options expiration approaching, Wall Street was wondering if Gill would exercise the contracts to receive the shares or just close out the position.\n\nGill\u2019s cryptic X posts, combined with portfolio checks on his Reddit handle, have sent investors piling into GameStop shares over the past four weeks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera\u2019s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World\u2019s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Gamestop's highly-anticipated shareholder meeting ran into a technical problem Thursday \u2014 resulting in many eager investors being unable to log on to the livestream.\n\nA spokesperson for Computershare, the company hosting the webcast, confirmed that \u201cunprecedented demand\" from shareholders looking to access the meeting led to a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d that prevented some from getting through. The meeting was then adjourned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really sorry that this happened and are working with our supplier to ensure that it does not happen again,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement sent to The Associated Press Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe meeting was originally slated to begin at 11 a.m. ET. Around that time, those attempting to use the link found that it wouldn\u2019t load or received an error message.\n\nAccording to social media accounts of those who appeared to make it on the call, Gamestop briefly cited \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d before adjourning the meeting. It was not immediately clear when the event would be rescheduled.\n\nThe Grapevine, Texas-based video game retailer did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday.\n\nDespite the fumble, Gamestop's shares were still up for than 6% by Thursday afternoon.\n\nAt the center of the meme stock craze, Gamestop saw a resurgence last month after Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d returned online for the first time in three years.\n\nAll eyes have been on whether Gamestop can make a comeback. Roaring Kitty recently took to YouTube on Friday, to tell his hordes of followers that he still believes GameStop\u2019s management team can turn the struggling company around following a disappointing earnings report.\n\nThere's a long way to go. Gamestop managed to narrow its losses in the first quarter, but its revenue fell as sales weakened for hardware and accessories, software and collectibles. GameStop also filed paperwork with securities regulators to sell up to 75 million shares of stock.\n\nView comments",

The number of outstanding contracts dropped 34% to 111,818, fewer than the 120,000 Gill alleged in a social media post earlier this month to have bought. A subsequent post showed as of June 10 he still held the position.\n\nWednesday\u2019s high volume of trading and change in outstanding positions \u201csuggest that Gill, assuming he is in fact the holder of those calls, sold to close\u201d at least part the position, according to Christopher Jacobson, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group.\n\nRead more: GameStop \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Calls See Trading Flurry as Shares Dive\n\nNews of his position sent shares nearly doubling to over $45 this month, before retreating. The company capitalized on the rally to sell $2.14 billion of shares. With expiration approaching, the question has remained whether Gill would exercise the contracts to receive shares, or close out the position.\n\nAs of early Thursday, Gill had yet to address the Wednesday afternoon trades or his holdings, despite rampant speculation that he had exited the unverified position. What \u2014 if anything \u2014 that might mean for shares remains unclear. GameStop shares sank 17% amid the flurry of trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe $20 calls, which closed at $6.40 Wednesday, traded between $6 and $7.95 early Thursday as shares rose about $1 to $26.46. That leaves the options still above his purported average purchase price of $5.6754.\n\n\u201cWhichever direction that shares move today, it\u2019s not going to be because they\u2019re blaming Keith Gill,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter, referring to retail traders. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be negative.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Sell in June Before They Dive",
        "content": "Growth stocks are names that are anticipated to grow at a rate significantly above the market itself. The companies listed below are expected to grow a great deal by their most zealous advocates. However, the firms profiled in this column are extensively overvalued. These growth stocks to sell are likely to disappoint bulls while their valuations are far too high.\n\nImportantly, the valuations of some of these growth stocks to sell have become stretched in recent weeks due to the revival of the meme-stock trend. But the momentum is generally weak. And many of these names are unable to sustain even the initial gains they\u2019ve registered. I believe that most or all of the momentum will be lost in the medium-term. With that in mind, here are three growth stocks to sell.\n\nGameStop (GME)\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTroubled retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) has risen on the back of the meme stock revival. This has been helped by positive remarks about GME stock by Roaring Kitty, the meme-stock investor and commentator.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut Roaring Kitty, who holds 120,000 call options on GME stock that expire on June 21, is likely focused on obtaining large, short-term gains from his involvement with the name. While it\u2019s true that he also owns 5 million shares of GameStop, he can quickly sell that position as well.\n\nAnd speaking of unloading the company\u2019s shares, CEO Ryan Cohen\u2019s stake in the firm has dropped to 8.6%, versus 10.5% last month. Cohen\u2019s decision to sell a large number of the company\u2019s shares does not bode well for its longer-term outlook.\n\nAnother negative for GME is the fact that GameStop recently sold an additional $2.14 billion of its shares. And the 29% decline in the firm\u2019s first-quarter revenue versus the same period a year earlier likewise makes me more bearish on the name.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is another meme name. However, the momentum of AMC stock appears to have greatly weakened in recent weeks. After hitting a recent high of $11.88 at the beginning of the meme-stock revival, the stock price is now not much higher than the $4.54 low it on March 15.\n\nMeanwhile, another InvestorPlace columnist, Rich Duprey, recently reported that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, one of this year\u2019s summer blockbusters, probably won\u2019t be profitable. That indicates that the film isn\u2019t drawing a large number of viewers, boding poorly for AMC\u2019s Q2 performance. Duprey believes that two other movies due out soon, Deadpool & Wolverine and Despicable Me 4, will perform better at the box office. Still, as he points out, \u201d\u00a0it\u2019s tough to run a business on just a pair of hits every year.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd as I noted in a recent column, the company\u2019s attendance in the U.S. dropped 5.8% in Q1 year-over-year. Meanwhile, it burned a huge $268 million of cash in the 12 months that ended in March.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it\u2019s clear that AMC\u2019s fundamentals are quite poor.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is facing very tough competition on multiple fronts.\n\nBABA stock is being threatened by the rapid growth of two other Chinese e-commerce firms, JD.com ( NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). Alibaba\u2019s share of the Chinese e-commerce market tumbled to 37% last year from 80% in 2017.\n\nBloomberg recently noted that Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit slashed its prices by as much as 97%. The company even lowered the prices that it charges for nine of its artificial intelligence-powered offerings.\n\nIn Q1, Alibaba\u2019s EBITDA fell to $4.82 billion from $4.97 billion during the same period a year earlier.\n\nGiven these points, BABA stock definitely belongs on everyone\u2019s list of growth stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "By Suzanne McGee\n\n(Reuters) - When Keith Gill appeared on a YouTube video in the summer of 2020 to discuss GameStop, he argued that the company's future was far rosier than the market expected. Nearly four years later, he remains bullish, even if most of his key predictions have gone unfulfilled.\n\nThe stock influencer, who uses the moniker Roaring Kitty, has again made an argument for GameStop after a long absence from social media, reviving the meme stock trend that GameStop's roller-coaster stock-market ride in 2021 helped to spark.\n\nThis year, GameStop's volatile shares have jumped 45% and trade around $25, after Gill revealed publicly this month a $116-million investment in the company.\n\nMany of the predictions underpinning Gill's original thesis and investor exuberance, however, such as a revival in sales and profitability, have yet to sustainably materialize, based on Reuters' evaluation of his public statements and GameStop's financial disclosures.\n\n\"During the first go around in 2020, some of his thinking was really thoughtful and absolutely spot-on,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who has covered GameStop for more than 20 years. Today, however, the company's core business faces growing challenges, he said.\n\nTexas-based GameStop, which holds its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, did not respond to e-mail and telephone requests for comment. Gill could not be reached by email or phone.\n\nBULLISH ARGUMENTS\n\nGill originally forecast that GameStop, a retailer of new and used video games, consoles and collectibles, would grow revenues and earnings and embrace a transformative business strategy based on fostering a gamer community.\n\nGill predicted in July 2020 that the competitive threat to GameStop's retail operations from digital downloads of games was \"overblown.\" He argued that the industry-wide transition to digital seemed slower than bears feared.\n\nGameStop has reduced its number of physical stores by 9% from 2021 to 4,169 in its most recent fiscal year.\n\nPachter said that the market selling physical gaming software has shrunk rapidly since 2020. He calculates that sales of physical software account for about 3% of the overall gaming market, which he estimates at $183 billion, versus 4% in 2020.\n\nNewzoo, a gaming analytics firm, said in a May 2024 review, that the market has almost entirely moved away from physical sales. GameStop does not break down the split between its physical and digital software sales.\n\nGill also predicted that then-CEO George Sherman's \"GameStop Reboot\" plan would reinvent the company as a premier gaming hub. To support this, Gill pointed to the launch in fall of 2019 of a dozen concept stores that included interactive gaming spaces.\n\nStory continues\n\nGill reiterated his bullish view in Congressional testimony in February 2021, saying GameStop \"has a unique opportunity to pivot to a technology-driven business by embracing the digital economy.\"\n\nFollowing the pandemic and disappointing financial results, GameStop ceased providing updates about its concept stores, however, according to a Reuters review of its filings.\n\nGameStop disclosed in its annual earnings filings the closure of its cryptocurrency and NFT (non-fungible token) business, which included a partnership with now-defunct FTX.\n\nGameStop CEO Ryan Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Neither of its two most recent CEOs, George Sherman and Matt Furlong, responded to requests for comment made via business social media platform LinkedIn.\n\nIn one of his few public commentaries on his involvement with GameStop - a November 2022 video interview with GMEdd.com, - Cohen said he would rather be \"an e-commerce company than a bricks-and-mortar retailer.\" GMEdd.com is a collective of retail investors tracking the company's stock.\n\nZacks Equity Research, while rating GameStop a \"sell\", said in a report published Monday that \"management is progressing well with its growth endeavors\" by strengthening e-commerce delivery and service.\n\nGill's latest YouTube livestream came this month, hours after GameStop posted a 29% decline in sales for the first quarter, although it reported a narrower loss. In 2020, Gill forecast earnings and revenues would improve.\n\n\u201cI expect earnings to improve significantly,\u201d from the second half of 2020 onward, Gill told his followers in July 2020. GameStop posted a net loss of $215 million for fiscal 2020, a loss of $381 million in fiscal 2021 and a loss of $313 million in 2022.\n\nThe company, however, posted a profit of $6.7 million for fiscal 2023 as it reduced expenses.\n\nGill was similarly bullish on revenues back in 2020, awaiting the release of new consoles by major gaming companies. \"You might get a big jump next year,\" he said in August that year.\n\nGameStop recorded revenues of $5.09 billion in fiscal 2020 which rose to $6.01 billion in fiscal 2021. However, sales eased to $5.93 billion in fiscal 2022 and dipped again to $5.27 billion in fiscal 2023.\n\nSTOCK PRICE, CASH RESERVES\n\nGameStop's sharp stock price gains during waves of retail investor enthusiasm, however, did allow the company to raise capital. It announced Tuesday it raised $2.14 billion through a fourth such sale of 75 million shares.\n\nPachter said share sales produced a hefty cash cushion he estimates could generate $100 million in annual interest income.\n\nOne high-profile short seller, Andrew Left of Citron Research, on Wednesday said he closed out a short position in GameStop, citing their capital raising, although he said he did not believe a turnaround in the company's fundamentals would happen.\n\nGill retains his faith in the company.\n\n\"Pause for a moment and think about\" what might come next for GameStop, Gill told the livestream on Friday. \"That becomes the bet.\"\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; additional reporting by Medha Singh and Pranav Kashayap in Bengaluru; editing by Megan Davies and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge of trading in some short-dated GameStop options contracts on Wednesday suggested to some market participants that Keith Gill, the stock influencer known as Roaring Kitty, may have sold some of his recently-disclosed options position in the company.\n\nGill, who helped launch the meme-stock phenomenon in 2021, recently disclosed a sizeable GameStop stock and options position in a screen shot posted on Reddit on June 2. The screen shot showed he held 120,000 GameStop June 21 call options at a strike price of $20, bought at $5.6754 per contract or $68.1 million in all. The screen shot also showed he owned 5 million GameStop shares worth $115.7 million on June 2.\n\nOn Wednesday, some 93,000 of the June call options changed hands, some of it in large chunks of 5,000 contracts or more.\n\nReuters was unable to independently verify whether the contracts were sold or whether Gill was behind the trades.\n\nTaking into account the volume of trading on Wednesday, the contracts changed hands at an average price of $7.65, according to Trade Alert data. Many of the trades took place below the bid price, indicating that a seller may have been trying to offload the contracts, Trade Alert data showed.\n\n\"(It) looks like he is closing the position,\" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.\n\n\"While he did not finish closing he probably has enough cash now to exercise the rest if he wanted to,\" Murphy said.\n\nOverall, GameStop options volume jumped to 1.2 million contracts on Wednesday, 66% higher than the average daily volume for the stock's options over the last month, according to Trade Alert data.\n\nGill's options position has seen big gyrations in recent sessions with the value of the options position jumping as high as $341 million before briefly going $7.5 million in the red on Tuesday.\n\nOptions market participants have been watching the position closely since Gill disclosed them.\n\n\"We won't know for sure until we see the open interest figures tomorrow morning, but I can't imagine who else would pound out such huge sales at discounts,\" said Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers' chief strategist.\n\nBased on their closing price of $6.40 a contract, Gill's 120,000 contracts would have finished the session valued at $76.8 million, up some $8.7 million from when he bought them, according to Reuters calculations.\n\nGameStop shares finished the session down 16.5% at $25.46. The shares are up 45% for the year.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop Analyst Lowers Price Target After 'Rambling Presentation By Roaring Kitty': Does Video Game Company Have 'Enough Runway To Appease Its Cult-Like Shareholders'?\n\nShares of video game retailer GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) have traded higher in recent weeks on optimism from the return of Roaring Kitty (aka Keith Gill) and several share offerings raising cash for the company.\n\nOne analyst shared his take on the latest events and recent share offering.\n\nWhat Happened: Over the past 30 days, GameStop completed two at-the-market offerings, selling batches of 45 million and 75 million shares.\n\nThe most recent sale of 75 million shares raised $2.137 billion, which translated to an average share price of $28.50.\n\nWedbush analyst Michael Pachter criticizes the sale price in a recent investor note.\n\n\"Given that GameStop's share price closed at $46 on June 6, we had assumed it would complete the sale at an average price of $40. Instead, the shares declined precipitously on June 7, reflecting news from Reddit following a rambling presentation by Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill),\" Pachter said.\n\nThe analyst has an Underperform rating and lowered the price target from $13.50 to $11.\n\nPachter said the new price target reflected the \"lower-than-expected proceeds from the share offering.\" The analyst estimated GameStop had around $9.50 per share in net cash.\n\nOn Wednesday, Citron Research also announced it was no longer short GameStop.\n\n\"It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,\" Citron's Andrew Left tweeted.\n\nLeft previously told Benzinga he was short GameStop shares again. Left was one of the key figures in the 2021 short squeeze of GameStop shares.\n\nRelated Link:\u00a0Who Is Roaring Kitty? Why Does His Return To Social Media Matter For GameStop Stock?\n\nWhat's Next: The offerings from GameStop draw mixed comments from Pachter and Left as the video game retailer may have taken advantage of the rising share price from increased trading activity in recent weeks.\n\nGameStop has said it will use the net proceeds from the offering for \"general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\"\n\nInvestors appear excited about the potential of acquisitions and investments, with trust from many GameStop shareholders, including Roaring Kitty, being placed in the turnaround strategy from CEO Ryan Cohen.\n\nThe two at-the-market share offerings raised $933.4 million and $2.137 billion respectively, adding $3 billion to the balance sheet of GameStop.\n\nGameStop ended the first quarter on May 4 with $1.083 billion. The company previously said its cash balance was $1.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cash balance could provide optimism for several reasons. First, the possibility of investments and acquisitions. With a shift to digital games, GameStop could look to diversify itself away from physical games for future growth.\n\nAnother item to keep in mind is the GameStop announcement last year that CEO Cohen now has additional control over the company's cash holdings. Cohen can buy and sell stocks and make other investments.\n\n\"On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new investment policy that permits the Company to invest in equity securities, among other investments,\" the company said previously.\n\nGameStop's filing didn't mention cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), but investors are excited for the potential for cryptocurrency investment. Investors would love to see Cohen invest a portion or all of the company's cash into Bitcoin and turn GameStop into a similar trading vehicle to MicroStrategy, whose former CEO and current Chairman Michael Saylor began buying up Bitcoin with the company's cash.\n\nAs mentioned by Left, the new cash balance could help provide a runway for shareholders.\n\nGameStop reported adjusted net income of $6.7 million in fiscal 2023, which was an improvement from a loss of $13.1 million in 2022.\n\nThe company struggled in recent quarters with losses, but several quarters have witnessed positive earnings per share.\n\nHere are the most recent quarters with data from Benzinga Pro:\n\nQ1 2024: -$0.12\n\nQ4 2023: $0.22\n\nQ3 2023: $0.00\n\nQ2 2023: -$0.03\n\nQ1 2023: -$0.14\n\nWith the new cash balance, GameStop now has more potential to survive from future losses. The cash balance gives the company the opportunity for acquisitions and investments, but more importantly, the ability to not borrow or potentially not have to raise more capital in coming years.\n\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting details of what GameStop will do with the cash in the coming months, but right now many, including Roaring Kitty, are betting Cohen will make the right moves.\n\nGME Price Action: GameStop shares are down 1.87% to $29.92 on Wednesday versus a 52-week trading range of $9.95 to $64.83.\n\nRead Next:\u00a05 Ways The GameStop, Meme Stocks Rally Could Fizzle: Stock Offerings, Boredom And More\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\nLatest Ratings for GME\n\nDate Firm Action From To Dec 2021 Ascendiant Capital Maintains Sell Jun 2021 Wedbush Maintains Underperform Apr 2021 Ascendiant Capital Downgrades Hold Sell\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for GME\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nGAMESTOP (GME): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article GameStop Analyst Lowers Price Target After 'Rambling Presentation By Roaring Kitty': Does Video Game Company Have 'Enough Runway To Appease Its Cult-Like Shareholders'? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "GameStop (GME) raised almost $2.14 billion as it capitalized on the recent stock rallies spurred by the online reemergence of influential retail trader Keith Gill.\n\nThe video game retailer said on Tuesday it completed the sale of 75 million shares, an offering announced last Friday hours before Gill, known by his online aliases \"Roaring Kitty\" and \"Deep F***ing Value,\" went live on YouTube for the first time in three years.\n\nOn Wednesday, the heavily shorted stock gained 8%.\n\nThe stock has been on a roller-coaster ride over the past month as Gill, known for his bullish videos and posts that helped spur the meme frenzy of 2021, reemerged across social media platforms.\n\nThe level of enthusiasm for GameStop from retail traders this time around hasn't matched that of three years ago, according to inflow data tracked by Vanda Research.\n\nGameStop stock attracted $18 million worth of purchases last Monday as the stock surged following a post from Gill showing a massive position in the stock. By comparison, the stock's peak inflow reached $87.5 million on Jan. 27, 2021.\n\n\"I still think that it\u2019ll be hard to draw as large a crowd as in 2021. These flows are likely coming from a small subset of loyalists,\" Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini told Yahoo Finance on Monday. Daily net flows signal investors showing \"paper hands.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Citron Research, led by founder Andrew Left, announced it is no longer short GameStop after it was revealed the veteran short seller had a position in the stock last week.\n\n\"It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders,\" read Citron's post on X.\n\nThree years ago, Citron was forced to sell its short position in GameStop at a loss as an army of retail traders bought the stock.\n\nCitron is no longer short $GME.

        "title": "GameStop (GME) Upgraded to Buy: Here's Why",
        "content": "GameStop (GME) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nThe Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for GameStop basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor GameStop, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for GameStop\n\nThis video game retailer is expected to earn $0.14 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 133.3%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for GameStop. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 21.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of GameStop to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "GameStop hit the jackpot.\u00a0Roaring Kitty\u2019s favorite meme stock walked off with a record $2.1 billion in gross cash\u2014even adjusted for inflation, exceeding the amount it raised in two separate share sales in 2021 combined.\n\nAnd GameStop has 38-year-old social media trader Keith Gill to thank for it.\n\nIn anticipation of a looming short squeeze triggered by last week\u2019s definitive return of Roaring Kitty, a soaring stock price gifted the company a\u00a0perfect opportunity to unload 75 million shares at an average price of $28.50 each on a market all too desperate to get their hands on more.\n\nWhile it may have ruined Gill's bid to become the first person to become a billionaire on paper during a livestream, it's a life preserver for the struggling brick-and-mortar games retailer.\n\nDue to the terms of the offering, the loss-making company enjoys widespread discretion to do what it sees fit with the company\u2019s windfall gain\u2014no strings attached.\n\nIt was a second major victory for chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen after a court\u00a0dismissed an unrelated lawsuit hanging over the activist investor\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cGameStop intends to use the net proceeds\u2026for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments,\u201d the company said in a statement on Tuesday, a common boilerplate phrase that grants management broad scope.\n\nCohen can thank his lucky stars that Roaring Kitty, alias Keith Gill, reemerged out of the blue three years after the latter celebrated an epic victory over Wall Street hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which got burned speculating on a drop in the price of GameStop shares.\n\nCommunicating at first entirely through memes, Gill signaled he was back to finish the job on May 13.\n\nOn June 2, he uploaded to Reddit, where he posts under the account DeepFuckingValue, a screenshot of his E*Trade account showing he had quietly amassed a long position in stocks and options worth over $181 million.\n\nWhile this may have reduced GameStop to little more than the financial equivalent of a ball of yarn, Cohen seized on Roaring Kitty\u2019s return from retirement to make hay.\n\nDoubles the size of the company's assets\n\nTogether with a\u00a0stock sale in May that saw 45 million new shares issued\u2014only days after the cryptic memes were first posted\u2014GameStop padded its accounts with $3 billion in cash.\n\nTo put this massive haul into context, its net cash only amounted to roughly $1 billion at the end of the first quarter, and the size of its balance sheet totaled just $2.6 billion.\n\nIn other words, the company quadrupled its cash pile while more than doubling its assets in the span of just four weeks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitron is no longer short $GME. It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders. Despite Wedbush setting an $11 target today, we respect the\u2026\n\n\u2014 Citron Research (@CitronResearch) June 12, 2024\n\nOne of the short-sellers burned by Gill three years ago in 2021 is hedge fund manager Andrew Left.\n\nHe confirmed just last week he was back to placing bearish bets on the stock, but news that GameStop lined its pockets prompted him to now think twice and watch events unfold from the sidelines.\n\n\"Citron is no longer short GME,\" his firm wrote. \"It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the cash infusion is a massive boon for a company that operates over 4,000 stores worldwide but is experiencing a technological shift.\n\nGameStop specializes in selling physical copies of video games, but more publishers are considering eliminating the format in favor of licensing them as downloads from the cloud.\n\nSony and Microsoft, the respective manufacturers of the PlayStation and Xbox, already offer cheaper next-gen consoles that lack optical media drives entirely.\n\nFrance\u2019s Ubisoft, the games publisher behind the Assassin\u2019s Creed and FarCry franchises, says people will need to accept that in the future, they won\u2019t own their games, just like they don\u2019t own their movies anymore now that there\u2019s streaming.\n\n\u201cGamers are used to\u2014a little bit like DVD\u2014having and owning their games,\u201d Ubisoft exec Phillipe Tremblay told GamesIndustry.biz earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s the consumer shift that needs to happen.\u201d\n\nIf companies like Ubisoft eventually only sell their wares through the cloud, what purpose will GameStop stores still serve?\n\nFortunately for Cohen, many hard-core gamers still viscerally oppose this trend.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

They have a fervent supporter. You\u2019ve got to respect the markets.\u201d\n\nLeft placed new bets against the video-game retailer in May and June, he said. While he didn\u2019t disclose the size of the positions, he said they were much smaller than previous ones placed against the video game retailer. He has steadily been closing them since the end of last week. Shares of GameStop are down around 1% and swinging wildly in early trading Wednesday after rising 23% on Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, GameStop announced that it was raising more than $2.1 billion in a share sale program to capitalize on the rally in its stock price. The company raised $933 million in late May, also by selling equity.\n\nLeft and GameStop have a lengthy history. In early 2021, Left\u2019s firm Citron Research suffered staggering losses from a short bet against the meme stock, Left announced that his firm would no longer publish short-selling research, ending a two-decade-long practice. Citron Research has since returned to publishing short reports, but with much less frequency than before.\n\nThe firm has also been at the center of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into short selling by hedge funds and research firms.\n\nGameStop\u2019s wild swings over the past few weeks have whiplashed traders in the last few weeks as Keith Gill, an investor and meme stock influencer who goes by DeepF\u2014-ing Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on X, returned to social media and hosted a YouTube livestream, sparking speculation about his bets on GameStop. Gill rose to fame in 2021 by rallying retail traders on Reddit.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s ridiculous, and I think this whole Roaring Kitty live stream was a joke,\u201d Left said. \u201cIf it gets to a certain price, I\u2019ll probably short some.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Bailey Lipschultz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks The Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Food Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices Tesla Shareholders Face the $56 Billion Question\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Pranav Kashyap and Medha Singh\n\n(Reuters) - Citron Research no longer has a short position in retail traders' favorite GameStop, the short seller said on X.com on Wednesday, days after taking a bearish position in the company.\n\n\"It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult like shareholders,\" Citron said in the tweet.\n\nAndrew Left, Citron Research's founder, had said last week he was again betting against GameStop, although his position was \"significantly lower\" from 2021 when he was forced to close his position after retail traders banded together in online forums and drove an eye popping rally in the stock, squeezing hedge funds.\n\nLeft told Reuters he would short GameStop again if the stock reached a $45-$50 level. He said Citron closed the short position at a profit, although he did not disclose the size.\n\nGameStop said it had raised $2.14 billion in gross proceeds from the stock sale it announced last week, after raising $933.4 million in May, as it capitalized on the meme stocks rally sparked by the return of stock influencer \"Roaring Kitty\" Keith Gill following a three-year hiatus.\n\nThe struggling videogame retailer said it intends to use the capital for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe company's stock rose 4% in premarket trading on Wednesday. Since Gill's livestream on Friday, the stock has declined 34% in value but it has still gained 70% from mid-May when the key figure that sparked the Reddit frenzy resurfaced on X.com.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Pranav Kashayap in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ouch! 3 Growth Stocks to Sell or You\u2019re Gonna Get Burned.",
        "content": "Generally speaking, there are lots of good reasons to consider investing in growth stocks right now. The primary factor is the expectation of rate cuts at some point this year. The European Central Bank just initiated rate cuts that pushed European growth shares higher. The same is bound to happen stateside at some point, which is why growth stocks are appealing.\n\nThat said, not all growth stocks are created equal. Some growth stocks simply benefit from irrational exuberance that is bound to dissipate. Those are exactly the kinds of companies investors must avoid.\n\nThe recent resurgence of meme stocks is responsible for some of the irrational exuberance at the moment. It isn\u2019t the only factor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME stock) logo on the outside of a store\n\nSource: Emil O / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvesting in GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock is a surefire way to get burned. Surely there are hundreds and thousands of individual investors who have individual anecdotes of great success they\u2019ve achieved by investing in GameStop.\n\nKeith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty on social media, is the most obvious example. However, his massive success may not even result in any appreciable gains since he is at risk of being charged with market manipulation.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to predict what will happen with GameStop stock at this point. Influencers like Gill clearly can send share prices higher but that means little to the average retail investor who has nowhere near that level of influence. All you and I can say is that from a fundamental perspective, GameStop is not attractive.\n\nThe company just released earnings which showed that revenues continue to fall and the company continues to produce losses. Fundamentally speaking, there\u2019s no reason to believe in the stock. GameStop is going to continue to move wildly until June 21 when Roaring Kitty\u2019s options expire so ride that roller coaster if you please but many are going to get burned.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere\u2019s no logical way to argue that Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) isn\u2019t an attractive growth stock overall.\u00a0 Year-to-date returns above 80% speak for themselves. The company also recently posted record revenues of $618 million at the beginning of May. Furthermore, the company is profitable at the net income level, reporting $157 million in earnings during the first quarter.\n\nYet I can\u2019t help but feel Robinhood is due for a correction sooner or later. It continues to be wildly overpriced relative to its competitors. The company\u2019s success could soon be its undoing. Part of the reason that Robinhood is popular is its crypto unit. Yet the Securities & Exchange Commission is pursuing Robinhood and is likely to sue the company in the near future.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond that, can its biggest proponents even trust Robinhood? There are reports traders have been blocked from purchasing and selling GameStop shares in the most recent frenzy.\n\nIt\u2019s my experience that companies that fly high and suffer from such allegations often fall dramatically.\n\nLucid Holdings (LCID) A Lucid (LCID) Air displayed in its own vitrine in Madison Square Park in New York. Lucid Motors started trading on the NASDAQ exchange via a SPAC merger.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot long ago, Lucid Holdings (NASDAQ:LCID) was one of the most hyped electric vehicle (EV) stocks. These days there\u2019s much less excitement surrounding its shares but it is still a growth target for investors.\n\nThose investors are awaiting rate cuts and any other potential catalysts that could revive the EV market overall.\n\nYet, there is little reason to believe in Lucid at this point. The company is losing piles of money and its revenues aren\u2019t growing quickly. Lucid is nowhere near making money from sales of its flagship Air series sedans.\n\nDespite that, the company has plans to launch an SUV later this year. The company is absorbing the massive costs associated with manufacturing a completely new vehicle while remaining extremely unprofitable. The result will be the company reporting drastically larger losses once it initiates sales of that SUV. Lucid will likely need to fire more employees while simultaneously hoping it can magically produce a completely new SUV. And somehow business fundamentals are supposed to improve. None of it adds up and LCID stock will fall because of it.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 12, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights GameStop GME, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Microsoft MSFT, Tesla TSLA and Qualcomm QCOM.\n\nAre Stock Splits Always Bullish? Lessons from NVIDIA's 10-for-1\n\nEven the second round of \u201cmeme stock mania\u201d in GameStop, which took Wall Street by storm last week, can\u2019t hold a candle to the continuous hype train that is semiconductor and market leader Nvidia. Best known for its high-performance semiconductors, Nvidia has been a Wall Street force since going public in January 1999. Founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia personifies one of history\u2019s most unlikely Wall Street stories.\n\nThough the semiconductor industry is one of the most cutthroat industries on Wall Street, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia found its niche in the space and has dramatically outperformed well-known competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nNvidia has recaptured investors\u2019 attention more recently as it benefits from the robust growth of the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Driven by unquenchable growth from mega-cap tech companies like Microsoft and Tesla, Nvidia has grown into one of the largest companies in the world by market cap and has seen its stock soar more than 3,000% over the past five years. NVDA is garnering the Street\u2019s attention this week for its 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nWhat Is a Stock Split?\n\nA stock split is a corporate action in which a company increases the number of shares for existing shareholders while decreasing the value of shares.\n\nHow Does a Stock Split Work?\n\nTo simplify the concept, investors can think of a stock split as swapping two nickels for a dime (representing a 2-for-1 split). In other words, if you have one share of a $100 stock pre-split, post-split you would hold two shares at a $50 value. Investors must understand that the market cap or value of the stock does not change. In Nvidia\u2019s case, shareholders received ten shares for every share they held before the split date - a 10-for-1 split.\n\nConversely, a reverse split represents the opposite - the share price increases while the number of shares held by the investor decreases. Again, there is no immediate change in the stock\u2019s value due to a stock split.\n\nWhy Does a Company Split its Stock?\n\nCompanies typically split their stocks to make shares more attractive to investors. For example, retail investors may prefer a lower-priced stock. Conversely, institutional investors may perceive penny stocks as low quality or be mandated not to invest in them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre Stock Splits Bullish?\n\nLike many things on Wall Street, stock splits should be weighed on a case-by-case basis by investors. Overall, historical stats indicate that stocks that split tend to outperform the S&P 500 Index over the next 12 months.\n\nExcessive Splits: A Word of Caution\n\nExcessive stock splits, or two or more stock splits in a year, may be a red flag for investors. A company that splits its stock too many times may be trying to compensate for deteriorating fundamentals or may simply be getting too greedy. Qualcomm, one of the best-performing stocks of the late 1990s, split twice in 1999, with the last split occurring in December. The next month, QCOM stock value topped out, and it would not make fresh highs again for two decades.\n\nStock Split: Factors to Consider\n\nA stock split is just one factor investors need to consider. Investors should consider how far a stock has run pre-split and, as always, avoid chasing the stock if not already long. Fundamentals and future EPS expectations play a crucial role in determining the stock\u2019s outlook. Finally, a stock split can add needed liquidity to an options market if the options became too expensive prior to the split.\n\nBottom Line\n\nStock splits are making headlines again after Nvidia split its stock on Monday. Investors should consider several factors when weighing the prospects of a recently split stock.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Decoding GameStop Corp (GME): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nAccording to the financial tables in the 10-Q filing, GameStop experienced a decrease in net sales from $1,237.1 million in the prior year to $881.8 million for the three months ended May 4, 2024. The cost of sales also saw a reduction, leading to a gross profit of $244.5 million. Despite a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses, the company reported an operating loss of $50.6 million and a net loss of $32.3 million. These figures set the stage for a deeper investigation into the company's financial health and strategic positioning.\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Recognition and Loyalty: GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) boasts a strong brand presence and a loyal customer base in the gaming community. The company's brand is synonymous with gaming culture, which has been cultivated through years of customer engagement and community-building efforts. GameStop's PowerUp Rewards program, now rebranded as GameStop Pro, continues to foster customer loyalty by offering exclusive benefits and incentives to its members.\n\nOmnichannel Retail Strategy: GameStop's multichannel approach, combining brick-and-mortar stores with robust e-commerce platforms, allows it to reach a wide range of customers and adapt to changing shopping behaviors. This strategy has been further enhanced by initiatives such as ship-from-store offerings, which improve product availability and fulfillment speed.\n\nFinancial Resilience: Despite recent losses, GameStop has maintained a strong balance sheet, bolstered by successful capital raises. The ATM Offering completed in June 2024 raised approximately $2.137 billion in gross proceeds, providing the company with substantial liquidity to navigate market fluctuations and invest in strategic initiatives.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDeclining Sales and Profitability: GameStop's recent financial performance indicates a concerning trend of declining net sales and profitability. The 28.7% decrease in net sales and the operational loss reported in the latest quarter reflect challenges in maintaining revenue streams and managing costs effectively. This downturn necessitates a critical review of the company's product offerings and cost structure.\n\nMarket Positioning Challenges: As the gaming industry evolves with the rise of digital distribution and streaming services, GameStop faces the challenge of redefining its value proposition to remain relevant. The company must navigate the shift away from physical game sales and adapt to the preferences of a consumer base increasingly inclined towards digital and mobile gaming experiences.\n\nOperational Efficiency: The reported decrease in SG&A expenses suggests ongoing efforts to streamline operations; however, the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 27.9% to 33.5% indicates that further optimization is needed. GameStop must continue to refine its cost containment strategies to improve operational efficiency and return to profitability.\n\nOpportunities\n\nStrategic Investments: The substantial capital raised through the ATM Offering provides GameStop with the opportunity to make strategic investments in growth areas. This could include acquisitions, expansion into new markets, or investments in technology to enhance the customer experience and operational capabilities.\n\nBrand Expansion: GameStop's strong brand equity presents an opportunity to diversify its product and service offerings. By leveraging its brand, the company could explore new revenue streams, such as exclusive merchandise, gaming events, or partnerships with game developers and publishers.\n\nE-commerce Growth: The ongoing shift towards online shopping presents an opportunity for GameStop to further strengthen its e-commerce platforms. By enhancing the online customer experience and integrating innovative technologies, GameStop can capture a larger share of the growing online retail market.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Pressures: GameStop operates in a highly competitive retail environment, facing competition from both physical and online retailers. The company must contend with aggressive pricing, promotional strategies, and the growing presence of direct-to-consumer offerings from game publishers and console manufacturers.\n\nConsumer Behavior Shifts: The gaming industry is rapidly changing, with new technologies and platforms emerging. GameStop must stay ahead of trends such as cloud gaming, virtual reality, and mobile gaming to meet the evolving demands of consumers and avoid obsolescence.\n\nEconomic Uncertainty: Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending patterns, can significantly impact GameStop's business. Economic downturns or shifts in discretionary spending could adversely affect sales and profitability.\n\nIn conclusion, GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) possesses a strong brand and a diversified omnichannel presence, which are key assets in the competitive retail landscape. However, the company faces challenges in reversing declining sales trends and adapting to a rapidly evolving gaming industry. The capital raised through recent offerings provides opportunities for strategic investments and growth, but GameStop must navigate external threats and internal inefficiencies to capitalize on these prospects and secure its future success.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "(Reuters) - GameStop said on Tuesday it had completed an \"at-the-market\" equity offering of its shares to raise roughly $2.14 billion in gross proceeds, days after meme stock influencer Keith Gill's first livestream in three years.\n\nShares of the videogame retailer, which has been at the center of the meme stock frenzy, rose more than 5% on the news before reversing course to fall 1.6% in volatile extended trading.\n\nOn a livestream on Friday with more than 600,000 viewers, Gill, the key figure behind an eye-popping rally in the struggling company's stock in 2021, joked about memes and interspersed his discussion of GameStop with various disclaimers. The stock closed the session down nearly 40%.\n\nGameStop said it sold the maximum amount of 75 million shares registered under the program.\n\nAccording to Reuters' calculations, the average sales price of each GameStop share came at around $28.50. The company's shares closed at $30.49 after Tuesday's trade.\n\nThe company said it intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\n\nGameStop last week surprised investors by releasing its first-quarter results ahead of schedule where it showed a 28.7% slide in revenues to $881.8 million, and announcing the stock sale.\n\nCEO Ryan Cohen held an 8.6% stake in the videogame retailer as of June 10, as per a regulatory filing on Tuesday, down from 10.5% as of May 22.\n\nIn May, the company raised another $933.4 million by selling 45 million shares. It had disclosed its share sale plan earlier that month amid a retail buying frenzy sparked by the return of Gill on social media.\n\nBullish calls by Gill, known on YouTube as \"Roaring Kitty\", on GameStop were a reason for the 2021 meme stocks frenzy.\n\nGill has helped attract a flood of retail cash to the beleaguered bricks-and-mortar retailer with his bullish case on Reddit posts and YouTube streams.\n\n(Reporting by Manya Saini, Sourasis Bose and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar and Vijay Kishore)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Robinhood Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Finding the most undervalued Robinhood stocks isn\u2019t as difficult a task as you might expect. The trading platform is often thought of as a place for traders to buy meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). And to be clear, both stocks are among the 100 most popular stocks on the platform. However, a look at the most popular stocks on Robinhood shows a much more conventional group of equities.\n\nThis is significant because according to data from finder.com, Robinhood (NYSE:HOOD) had over 23.6 million funded customers globally as of February 2024. Of those, the company reported 10.9 million monthly active users at the end of 2023. That\u2019s significantly higher than its nearest competitor, even if the average account value is only around $4,000.\n\nThe takeaway is that many Robinhood investors are far more conventional in their taste for stocks than you might think. And that means looking for stocks trading at a discount. Here are three undervalued Robinhood stocks that have been poor performers in the last year but offer significant upside for the rest of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has been a lackluster performer for several years. In the last five years, the total return on JNJ stock is 29%. And in the last 12 months, the stock\u2019s total return is loss of 4.3%. Some of the lack of interest is because the company spun off its consumer products division into Kenvue (NYSE:VUE).\n\nWhat\u2019s left deserves a closer look. The streamlined JNJ consists of two business units: Innovative Medicines and Medtech. In both areas, the company has significant announcements that could drive the business higher.\n\nOn May 31, Johnson & Johnson completed its acquisition of Shockwave Medical. This gives JNJ access to Shockwave\u2019s exclusive intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) platform that is approved for coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD).\n\nOn the Innovative Medicines front, Johnson & Johnson completed its $2 billion acquisition of Ambrx in March. This increases its exposure to antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) which are an area of heavy investment in the pharmaceutical space.\n\nJNJ stock has a consensus \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a price target of $171.77, a gain of approximately 16%. And that goes along with a dividend that yields 3.4% and has been increasing for 62 consecutive years.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been another difficult hold over the last few years. The total return for SBUX in the last five years is 9.5%. And in the past 12 months, it\u2019s been one of the worst-performing stocks with a total loss of 14.8%. But in the last month, the stock is bouncing higher which may signal that it\u2019s reached the \u201cso bad it\u2019s good stage.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would make investors believe that? First, look at China. In December 2023, the company projected double-digit revenue growth in the country in 2024. This was fueled by new store expansion and strong comparable sales. This is contradicted a little bit by the company\u2019s latest earnings report in which it forecast a full-year single-digit revenue decline in China. The truth may wind up being somewhere in between.\n\nHowever, a much simpler look may come from the company\u2019s revenue and earnings. In the first two quarters of the 2024 fiscal year were on par, if not slightly better than 2023. That could be why SBUX stock gets a \u201cstrong buy\u201d rating from eight out of 32 analysts.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Let Shopify Stock Finish Cooling off Before You Invest\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP) is last on this list of undervalued Robinhood stocks. The stock is down more than 20% in 2024, and retail investors are polarized about its future.\n\nThe bulls point to the company\u2019s investment in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) tools as e-commerce moves into the metaverse. They also see the company\u2019s year-over-year revenue and earnings growth as a bullish sign. On the other hand, naysayers will point out that year-over-year revenue is slowing. That wouldn\u2019t be what you want to see from a growing tech stock.\n\nHowever, analysts seem to be much less ambivalent about SHOP stock. Out of 47 analysts, 25 give the stock either a \u201cstrong buy\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d and there\u2019s no rating lower than \u201chold.\u201d They also are forecasting earnings growth of over 50%, which would support a higher stock price. That means investors may want to view the recent bounce off of a level around $56 as a signal to catch a rally in this undervalued stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you\u2019re Roaring Kitty, alias Keith Gill, the answer is yes.\n\nAfter GameStop shares closed 12% lower for the session, the YOLO king of the WallStreetBets community posted a screenshot showing his risky bet on the meme stock suffered another hefty drop in value.\n\nThe $17 million he lost on his 5 million shares in the company\u2014according to his Reddit post, where he\u2019s known as DeepFuckingValue\u2014were the least of his concerns. The drop in the underlying asset triggered an even larger swing in the value of his derivatives position, which fell an additional $34.5 million.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why his dated GameStop posts are all titled \u201cYOLO update,\u201d short for You Only Live Once, the credo of meme-stock speculators who emphasize a get-rich-or-die-trying mentality.\n\nThat\u2019s because Gill already watched on Friday as the grand total of $300 million went up in smoke before him, right when he was on the cusp of becoming a billionaire on paper.\n\nGameStop foils short squeeze with share issue\n\nHis apparent attempt to trigger a massive short squeeze in GameStop and catapult the value of his holdings into the 10-digits was foiled after the company launched a surprise stock offer that flooded the market with as many as 75 million newly issued shares. The news sent the GameStop price tumbling 40% on Friday, leaving it well below the threshold needed by Gill.\n\npic.twitter.com/wGdvs6xF7w\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) June 10, 2024\n\nFortunately, he seems to take it all with humor. \u201cYou\u00a0were a billionaire,\u201d Gill wrote on Monday in a self-deprecating post seen by over 5 million users on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the next move is for the 38-year-old, whose 2021 battle with GameStop short-sellers like hedge fund\u00a0Melvin Capital was immortalized last year on the silver screen in Dumb Money.\n\nAfter a three-year-long absence, Gill burst back onto the scene on May 13th with a series of memes on social media, effectively announcing the fight wasn\u2019t over until he said so.\n\nOn June 2, he then revealed he had amassed a GameStop position in stock and call options worth over $181 million.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop, Dogecoin, and the male identity crisis",
        "content": "In the last few years, two assets\u2014GameStop shares and Dogecoin on the crypto side\u2014have come to symbolize a reckless new form of investing. Both have had multiple weeks where their price has soared 100% or more based on no fundamental value proposition. Sure, there have been catalysts for various GME and DOGE rallies\u2014typically a pump signal from Roaring Kitty or Elon Musk\u2014but there is also a deeper, and somewhat troubling, explanation for what's going on: a crisis of male identity.\n\nI've weighed similar thoughts over the decade I've covered crypto, but the new book The Trolls of Wall Street makes the case explicitly. The book is primarily about the guys behind r/WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum where a community of primarily young men came together to share research and stock tips and, in time, stoked some of the craziest rallies in history.\n\nThe book is about the equities market, but its insights apply equally to crypto, which is fitting since the author, Nathaniel Popper, is a former Bitcoin reporter. Popper is sympathetic to his subjects and is quick to point out that, in many cases, the r/WallStreetBets crowd was more informed than the hedge fund barons who belittled them. In exploring their lives and motivations, however, Popper also identifies a common thread that led many of the participants to lean into nihilistic financial wagers and, in some cases, an embrace of some of the worst sexist and racist banter on the internet.\n\nThat common thread is the very human one of needing a place to belong and feel valued. The Trolls of Wall Street describes how many of the young men in the r/WallStreetBets forum\u2014as is the case in any given crypto one\u2014lived unsatisfying lives, and instead of launching a career or a family or doing the other things that come with being an adult, remained stalled and unable to flourish in the broader world. At the same time, young women have been faring better than ever in terms of education, income, and professional advancement.\n\nIn this context, Reddit and crypto forums offered young men a chance to engage in inappropriate jokes, and express the sort of competitive and aggressive behavior that felt natural\u2014even if the outside world wanted no part of it. It was also in these forums that great achievements such as outtrading billion-dollar hedge funds and building successful blockchains took place. They provided communities where men\u2014and, of course, some women\u2014could build something, for bad or for good.\n\nWhich brings us back to GameStop and Dogecoin. Both of these are a terrible place to put your money because they are building very little of value\u2014yet they still have legions of mostly young men who will back them anyway out of loyalty to their online community. That's fine, but it's hard to shake the feeling that most would be happier by seeking out more traditional forms of male validation instead. You may have a different opinion. If you want a longer take on the book, check out my review and Leo's Q&A with Popper.\n\nStory continues\n\nJeff John Roberts\r\njeff.roberts@fortune.com\r\n@jeffjohnroberts\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Michal Burry stocks have a certain cache. Most people know Burry as the investor who correctly saw the housing market crash of 2007 to 2008. He understood that the government\u2019s subprime mortgage policies would collapse the housing market. Scion Capital profited nearly $1 billion by betting against the housing market.\n\nThe events were chronicled in the book, \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which was subsequently made into a movie of the same name that spread Burry\u2019s fame even wider.\n\nBut Burry is a smart investor beyond his housing market call. His investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) in 2019 unwittingly led to the meme stock frenzy surrounding the video game retailer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough he was not an \u201cape\u201d who held on for dear life during its momentous ride in 2021, he reportedly made $250 million on his original $14 million investment.\n\nWhile he closed Scion Capital in 2008, he now runs Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund that has over $103 million in assets under management.\n\nAlthough subprime mortgages are making a comeback today under a new name, Burry isn\u2019t betting against housing today, at least not yet. Instead, 26% of Scion\u2019s portfolio is invested in the three Michael Burry stocks below. Let\u2019s see if they should be in your portfolio, too.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen everyone was fleeing Chinese stocks due to geopolitical tensions, Burry was rushing in. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, as shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) began their descent from $41 per share, Burry began buying them, scooping up 125,000 shares.\n\nHe added another 75,000 shares in the fourth quarter and bought 160,000 more in the first quarter of 2024, for a total of 360,000 shares.\n\nWhile JD.com stock would end up falling as low as $22 a stub in mid-January, they soon began marching higher and hit $35 last month.\n\nThey\u2019ve since fallen back to around $29 a share, which is in line with Burry\u2019s average buy-in price of $29.53, putting him essentially at break-even.\n\nJD.com is Burry\u2019s biggest holding, accounting for 9.5% of Scion\u2019s portfolio.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce platform is in turnaround mode. JD.com was caught flat-footed by a sluggish economy and not focusing on its online retail business while upstarts like PDD Holdings\u2018 (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu took share with deep discount pricing.\n\nJD responded with its own aggressive pricing and by dropping minimum order requirements for free delivery. The moves paid off. Its fourth-quarter earnings report easily beat analyst expectations as it drove tremendous traffic to its site again.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce site also kicked off its annual 618 shopping extravaganza on May 31 with a theme of \u201cquality and affordability.\u201d It is the equivalent of Amazon\u2018s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Day event but on steroids.\n\nAnalysts estimate JD sold around $60 billion worth of merchandise last year. Look for JD stock to rebound going forward.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com\u2019s peer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is Burry\u2019s second largest holding at $9 million, or 8.7% of Scion\u2019s portfolio. It is clear the hedge fund operator sees a lot of opportunity from China\u2019s biggest retailers.\n\nBurry began buying BABA stock at the same time he picked up shares of its rival and he now owns 125,000 shares worth $9 million.\n\nThe stock has undergone a similar journey to JD.com and Burry\u2019s average buy price is $80. Alibaba currently trades around $78 per share.\n\nFor many of the same reasons as JD.com, the outlook for Alibaba stock is just as bright. The Chinese government is supporting both consumers with new stimulus programs and companies by acting as a buyer of last resort for their stock.\n\nBecause China\u2019s stock market doesn\u2019t have circuit breakers like U.S. markets to minimize volatility, the government will step in and buy shares if they fall too hard too fast. It provides a floor of sorts for the stock, not that they can\u2019t fall through it though.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s improved operations while also focusing again on its core e-commerce business, provides plenty of runway for future growth.\n\nHCA Healthcare (HCA) a hand holding an iPhon with an HCA logo on the screen\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) is one of the largest hospital chains in the U.S., with facilities all across the country, but with a special focus on New York and Florida.\n\nRevenue and profits are moving higher for the hospital operator. First-quarter revenue jumped 11% to $17.3 billion while profits of $1.6 billion or $5.93 per share, were 22% higher. \u200b\u200b\n\nSame facility admissions increased 6.2% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 5.2%. Equally important, revenue per equivalent admissions was up 4% from the year ago period. Emergency room visits were 7% higher.\n\nBurry established a new position in HCA Healthcare in the fourth quarter last year buying 20,000 shares and adding 5,000 more in the first quarter. The 25,000 total is worth $8.3 million, making it Burry\u2019s third-largest holding at 8.1% of the portfolio\u2019s total.\n\nHis average buy-in price is $267 per share, giving Burry gains of 26% on HCA Healthcare\u2019s current price of $337 per share. There is no reason it can\u2019t go higher as health care, especially hospital care, remains an essential service few will go without.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Roaring Kitty's GameStop options bet briefly underwater as shares extend fall",
        "content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -The clock is ticking for Keith Gill, the stock influencer known on YouTube as \"Roaring Kitty,\" to lock in gains on his options position in GameStop as the company\u2019s share price wobbles and the expiration date for the contracts draws closer.\n\nGill helped launch the meme-stock phenomenon in 2021. His GameStop options holdings briefly slipped into the red on Tuesday as the company's shares fell 8% to a low of $22.79 before paring losses. The stock has lost nearly 50% since Friday's high of $48, when Gill\u2019s first livestream in three years failed to turn the shares around after the company announced a more than $3 billion stock offering.\n\nThe sharp declines have pressured the large options position that Gill disclosed earlier this month. A screen shot posted on June 2 showed Gill held 120,000 GameStop June 21 call options at a strike price of $20, bought at $5.6754 per contract or $68.1 million in all. The screen shot also showed he owned 5 million GameStop shares worth $115.7 million on June 2.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe price of the options contracts soared as high as $28.41 on Friday - putting their value at $340.9 million - before Gill conducted the livestream during which he reiterated his rationale for being bullish on GameStop.\n\nOn Tuesday, the options contracts briefly changed hands at an average price of $5.50 a contract, putting the value of Gill's position at about $66 million, down about $2 million from their purchase price, according to Trade Alert data. With the shares last at $24.60, the contracts were trading at $6.65.\n\n\"He had a chance to do something,\" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, referring to the rise in the value of Gill\u2019s options position during Friday\u2019s livestream. \"But at the end of the day, you know, he kind of blew it.\"\n\nGill has said he is a long-term investor in GameStop and that he is confident in the company\u2019s CEO, billionaire Ryan Cohen.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the nature of short-dated options contracts may mean Gill would have to make moves in the short term, especially if the stock continues to fall.\n\nThe calls expire on June 21, and lose value at an accelerated pace as that date approaches in a process known as time decay. Additionally, contracts with strike prices that are close to where the underlying stock is trading become even more susceptible to price swings.\n\nGill can also exercise his options and take delivery of the stock, meaning he would have to put up $240 million for 12 million GameStop shares.\n\n\"The guy is in a race against time decay,\" said Henry Schwartz, global head of client engagement at Cboe Global Markets.\n\nSo far, nothing in the listed options market indicates that Gill has been able to take profit or set up an offsetting position, Schwartz said.\n\n\"I think everybody's watching those contracts like a hawk,\" he said.\n\nMARKET MAKERS\n\nAnother factor that could influence GameStop\u2019s near-term share price is how market makers - typically big financial institutions that facilitate options trading but seek to remain market-neutral - will react if the shares continue sliding.\n\nMarket makers who sold Gill his call contracts would have likely squared the risk on their books by buying GameStop shares.\n\nIf the stock price slips below the contracts\u2019 strike price, market makers would have less need to remain hedged and could be in a position to sell shares, potentially exacerbating weakness in the stock.\n\n\"Traders will be anticipating this potential for the stock to accelerate towards $20 if it starts to move that way,\" Cboe's Schwartz said, noting market positioning ahead of such a move would inject more volatility into the stock.\n\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "GameStop shares fell for the second straight session Monday, down over 49%, notching the worst two-day stretch since February 3, 2001, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nStill, \"Roaring Kitty,\" also known as Keith Gill, is in the money with his GameStop holdings.\n\nGill, via his Reddit handle, Superstonk/Deep F-ing Value, posted his latest account performance on Monday. FOX Business, in coordination with Dow Jones Market Data Group, crunched the numbers.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT 'ROARING KITTY'\n\nFive million shares are worth $124.15 million as of today's close, up $17.78 million from the $106.37 he purchased them for.\n\nAs for his $20 call options that he purchased\u00a0for $5.67, each are currently trading at $6.81. The value of those options contracts are $81.72 million, up $13.62 million from the $68.10 million he purchased them for.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n'ROARING KITTY' BETS BIG ON GAMESTOP MANAGEMENT TEAM\n\nWith the call options, if he exercises them, Gill will have the ability to purchase 12 million shares at $20 a share, 120,000 contracts with each contract worth 100 shares, as detailed by Dow Jones Market Data Group. FOX Business is unable to independently confirm the accuracy of Gill's posts.\n\nGill\u2019s update follows his YouTube live stream on Friday, his first return to the social media broadcaster in about three years. Keith Gill, a Reddit user credited with inspiring GameStop's rally, is shown during a YouTube livestream on a laptop at the New York Stock Exchange on June 7, 2024.\n\nThe livestream, watched by around 600,000, had Gill reiterating his belief in the video game retailer with little new detail.\n\n\"It becomes a bet on the management\" of GameStop \u2014 particularly on CEO Ryan Cohen \"and his crew\" \u2014 during the \"transformation stage\" that he believes the\u00a0video game retailer has entered.\u00a0\"That\u2019s probably going to be an ongoing debate as to how people feel about him, whether he can successfully transform that business,\" the meme stock retail trader said, cracking jokes here and there. He also reminded his viewers to \"make your own decisions.\"\n\nCohen founded Chewey.com and attempted a failed turnaround of Bed Bath & Beyond, which filed for bankruptcy and is now part of Overstock.com.\n\nOn Friday, ahead of the livestream, GameStop reported a\u00a0net loss of $32.2 million compared to a loss of $50.5 million in the year-ago period. Sales fell 28% to $881 million, down from $1.2 billion. The company also plans to sell up to another 75,000,000 shares on top of the 45,000,000 already sold.\n\nGameStop shares have gained 98% this quarter, largely driven by Gill\u2019s return.\n\nOriginal article source:\u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019s GameStop position is in the money\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares of GameStop tumbled for a second consecutive session on Monday, extending deep losses after stock influencer Keith Gill's return to YouTube last week failed to spark fresh investor enthusiasm for the struggling shopping mall retailer.\n\nGill, known on YouTube as \"Roaring Kitty,\" held his first livestream in three years on Friday, the same day that GameStop unveiled its second share sale in days.\n\nA key figure behind an eye-popping rally in GameStop in 2021, Gill joked about memes and interspersed his discussion of GameStop with several disclaimers in a livestream that by Monday had over 2.4 million views on YouTube.\n\nOn Monday, GameStop shares sank about 15% to $24.06, adding to a nearly 40% slump on Friday after the company reported a drop in quarterly sales.\n\nAlso on Friday, GameStop said it would sell up to 75 million shares, days after it made $933 million by selling 45 million shares.\n\nOther so-called meme stocks also gave back recent gains on Monday, with AMC Entertainment losing nearly 7% and headphone seller Koss down about 4%.\n\nShares of GameStop nearly tripled in value over two days through May 14 after an account associated with Gill returned to X.com, formerly called Twitter. Since then, GameStop shares have given up most of those gains, and the stock remains up about 37% so far in 2024.\n\nThe videogame retailer has been losing money for years as customers shift to online purchases, and its latest quarter was no different.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop's Dismal Results Fail To Show Signs Of A Turnaround\n\nOn Friday, GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) failed to show signs of an operational turnaround as it delivered its fiscal first quarter results earlier than expected, previously saying they will be issued on June 11thafter market close. The unexpected and dismal results only hours before meme-stock influencer Keith Gill, better known under an alias\u00a0\u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d, held its\u00a0first livestream in three years after helping ignite a meme stock rally, to which\u00a0more than half a million viewers tuned in. But even Roaring Kitty's return couldn't\u00a0help GameStop's game with its stock plunging 40%.\n\nDismal first quarter results\n\nFor the period ended on May 4th, GameStop reported net sales dropped 29% to\u00a0$881.8 million, while FactSet estimates were between\u00a0$900 million\u00a0and\u00a0$1.09 billion. But GameStop did narrow its loss to\u00a0$32.3 million\u00a0after losing\u00a0$50.5 million\u00a0in last year\u2019s comparable quarter.\u00a0An adjusted loss of $0.12 per share\u00a0was also worse than Wall Street\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$0.09.\n\nGameStop has scary competitors.\n\nBeing\u00a0a one-stop-shop for video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise\u00a0places the\u00a0videogame retailer against the mighty Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Nintendo Co Ltd (OTC: NTDOY) and Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY). Amazon has an extensive delivery network and gets delivery orders quickly. Unsurprisingly, Amazon reported its revenue more than tripled over the past five years while GameStop\u2019s was halved. When it comes to online game sales, even with its efforts to shorten delivery times, GameStop can hardly catch up to Amazon.\n\nAlthough Sony is GameStop\u2019s B2B partner, it is also its B2C competitor as it sells video games directly to consumers. Back in May,\u00a0Sony forecasted\u00a0lower sales\u00a0of its\u00a0PlayStation 5 console\u00a0that is in its fifth year. Moreover, Sony guided for lower overall revenue at its gaming unit, but hoping greater user engagement and\u00a0more efficient\u00a0cost control\u00a0could fuel the segment\u2019s profitability. Along with Microsoft, who is also both a partner and competitor to GameStop, Sony announced layoffs across its gaming business. Overall, Microsoft is fine but mostly thanks to its Activision Blizzard acquisition with which it ensured its leadership position in the gaming arena. On Sunday, Microsoft will hold its annual video-game showcase with Xbox Game Pass taking center stage. Reuters reported that the\u00a0software giant prepares to roll out the latest installment in its best-selling \"Call of Duty\" franchise on the subscription service\u00a0in response to heavy competition from Sony and its consoles. With this move, Microsoft expects to boost the growth of its subscription service. Back in February, Microsoft reported its subscription service\u00a0had 34 million subscribers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is certain is that even the video game industry is changing.\n\nBut the video game industry that blends the tech and media industries is seeing sales going down with lowered usage and layoffs increasing in response to the looming AI automation. Back in 2021, GameStop was a struggling video game retailer in an environment where\u00a0digital downloads quickly started replacing discs. Three years later, it\u2019s seeing lower sales for hardware, accessories, software and collectibles, again being a struggling brick and mortar video game retailer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for\u00a0informational purposes only.

        "title": "Q&amp;A with the author of \u2018The Trolls of Wall Street\u2019: Gambling, conspiracies, and the return of Roaring Kitty",
        "content": "If Keith Gill, the stock-picking influencer known as Roaring Kitty, isn\u2019t the luckiest man in the world right now, then it\u2019s certainly Nathaniel Popper. A former reporter for the New York Times who covered the rise of crypto and retail trading, Popper has a new book out this week, The Trolls of Wall Street, which chronicles the history of the Wall Street Bets movement and meme stock craze that burned bright during the pandemic\u2014and then seemed to fizzle out.\n\nWhen Popper and I spoke in late May, it seemed that the once omnipresent stocks popularized by online communities, such as GameStop and AMC, were a distant memory, save for a few enigmatic memes posted on Twitter by Gill, the most prominent GameStop evangelist. Then Gill made his triumphant return as Roaring Kitty on YouTube, posting his first livestream in three years.\n\nWith meme stocks back in the headlines, now is the perfect time to read Trolls of Wall Street, which details the complex brew of variables behind the people-powered movement that brought some of the world\u2019s most powerful financial institutions to their knees. But Popper\u2019s book goes much deeper, detailing why the internet\u2019s fascination around trading dovetails with other phenomena defining our current culture, from Donald Trump to sports gambling. And amid the toxic memes, alienation, and abuse of communities like Wall Street Bets, he even finds some optimism in our new economic reality.\n\nThe following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYour first book, Digital Gold, is a definitive guide for anyone trying to understand how crypto emerged, along with its promises and failures. Why did you decide on Wall Street Bets as the next subject you wanted to explore in book form?\n\nI realized over time that crypto had become part of something much bigger than just crypto. In America, at least, you had this young generation of mostly men who had really gotten into money and trading. Crypto was often the gateway drug, but often people moved from there into all these interesting directions as they started to understand the financial system and how it worked, and all the different interlocking components. It became the new sort of sport that people were talking about and spending their free time on. And I wanted to understand where that came from and what it meant.\n\nOne of the more surprising parts of the book was that much of the Wall Street Bets community, or the moderators at least, really viewed themselves as separate from crypto and were even disdainful. But a lot of the mechanisms for why people are interested in day trading and crypto are the same, which is that dopamine rush. Where do you see the similarities and differences between the two?\n\nIt\u2019s really useful to remember that this all came out of the financial crisis when young people had distanced themselves from the whole world of money. Wall Street Bets was founded when Occupy Wall Street was happening. You had this alienation and disenchantment with the financial world, and people had largely pulled out of stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrypto was really important because it was the first time after the financial crisis that people saw other ordinary people getting rich. And that just hadn\u2019t happened in a while. But then pretty quickly, Robinhood came around, and you had social media to amplify it. When people did well, suddenly they saw their friends trading and making money. It\u2019s the old envy that sneaks in. And then you had the fact that Robinhood made this feel like a video game. You had this whole generation of young men who had gotten into video games, and now here was this real-world place where you could apply some of those skills and potentially make money at a moment when people were feeling sort of economically hopeless.\n\nIt was very easy for the crypto and Wall Street Bets trading cultures to become intertwined. Also because the physical, adrenaline junkie aspect of it was just there in both of them. If the crypto market starts going down, you just shift your money over to the stock market or the options market and you can have the same kind of fun there.\n\nDumb Money, the movie that just came out about meme stocks, tried to portray GameStop as a political movement similar to Occupy Wall Street, where people were fighting the short sellers and hedge funds\u2014the little guy versus the big guy. But your book is much more nuanced. People\u2019s motivations seemed to range from chasing dopamine rushes to combating male loneliness to developing actual trading strategies. Do you think there was an actual, coherent movement?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s too simple to call it a political movement, but there was an ideological or almost emotional sentiment underneath a lot of this. It still is this alienation and distrust towards people in power. And that grew out of the financial crisis. And social media amplified that and created this hothouse atmosphere online that has given us all of these different things including crypto and including day trading, but also Donald Trump. It was this trolling attitude that's just a middle finger to the world. It\u2019s almost more deeply seated than a political movement, and I think you can see it running across all these different parts of American life.\n\nAnd that's part of what got people going on GameStop. As you noted, there was a lot more there than just, \"It's a funny meme stock.\" There was this crowd-sourced research effort to understand the stock and the company. And they really found interesting stuff. And even that was about people looking to social community to fill something that was missing from their lives otherwise.\n\nIt seems like two constants in our culture now are gambling and conspiracies, and they do seem to converge in a lot of ways. If anything, that seems like one of the biggest impacts from the meme stock movement.\n\nGambling and conspiracies have joined together in a lot of this retail trading that's happened. After the GameStop took off in 2021, this whole sort of world of conspiracies about how Wall Street was controlling GameStop\u2014it really became this QAnon-like movement. You\u2019ve seen that elsewhere, and you certainly see it with crypto. It\u2019s partly because they come out of the same source, which is this pervasive distrust that we have in our society.\n\nWhen you were reporting this, what did you think was misunderstood?\n\nThe biggest thing is the idea that these guys are all just a bunch of idiots. What you've seen over time is that at many points, this crowd has ended up being much smarter than anyone assumed they would be. The clearest example came after COVID, when retail traders really dived into the markets. At that point, Wall Street was incredibly bearish and assuming that we were heading for a huge recession. Retail traders were sort of the only group that was betting on the economic recovery, and in some way, they did that because of the old Wall Street adage, you buy when there's blood in the streets. They seemed to do a lot better than hedge funds and institutions.\n\nWe have this idea that retail traders are the dumb money, but what we often miss is that retail traders are learning when they start, but if they spend enough time in the markets, they learn how the markets work. Sometimes what they learn is they're not good traders. But that's not always the lesson. In tracking this community over 10 years, what I saw, again and again, was that you have moments where everybody gets excited and dives in for the first time, and they often do it in a kind of stupid way, but they catch the fever and then spend time learning about it and they get better over time. There\u2019s just a lot of interesting data that's been coming out about how retail traders actually do a lot better than we have traditionally assumed.\n\nYou cite data at the end that seems almost an optimistic takeaway, which is that the advent of retail trading over the past few years has reduced the wealth gap. But it does seem like, at least over the past couple of years, there's been some receding of retail interest. What do you think has been the lasting impact of Wall Street Bets?\n\nMeme stocks have receded. Options trading, which is the riskiest side of this retail trading movement, has receded a little bit. But what's been really interesting is that the amount of stocks purchased by retail traders has really remained at this elevated level that we first saw during the pandemic. There is an ongoing and enduring interest in the markets, particularly among young retail investors. These online communities have made the markets feel approachable. It\u2019s made stocks seem like something that ordinary people can take part in. And I think that's a big change.\n\nAt the broadest level, the fact that young people own stocks has been increasing their wealth. It's been a good thing for young Americans to have more money in the stock market. It was considered this thing for old people. So that's a big change. It's starting to help eat away at that enormous inequality gap.\n\nIt seems that if you look at Wall Street Bets as a companion to Occupy Wall Street, it was similar in that it hasn\u2019t really changed the financial system at all, except that it had more people joining it. So rather than being disruptive, it created an \u2018If you can\u2019t beat them, join them\u2019 mentality. Do you think it did change the way the financial system operates, aside from retail traders becoming more active?\n\nThe fact that people are taking part changes things on a wider, cultural level. For the markets themselves, the retail crowd has tended to make more bets on speculative, future-leaning stocks like Nvidia, or Tesla, when it seemed like electric cars were taking off. There are these changes in the way sectors are valued, and you're seeing that play out in what companies get funded in the economy. These kinds of decisions end up reverberating through the economy.\n\nAnd you hear hedge funders complaining about how it's impossible to short stocks anymore.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m not sure if AMC and GameStop are future-leaning.\n\nI wouldn't argue that AMC and GameStop are the companies of the future. What's interesting to me is that we've focused so much on meme stocks that we've missed the broader change that's happened here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The S&P 500 ended Friday flat, despite hitting a record-high intraday, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected jobs report.\n\nThe broad market index dipped 0.11% to close at 5,346.99, after reaching an all-time high earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 87 points to 38,798.99, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.23% to end at 17,133.13.\n\nDespite the slight declines, all three major indices recorded gains for the week. The Dow rose 0.29%, the S&P 500 gained nearly 1.32%, and the Nasdaq advanced 2.38%.\n\nStocks initially faced pressure following the release of robust May jobs data, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury up by more than 15 basis points.\n\nMarkets will now shift their focus to the several key economic data releases due this week, most notably the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) report on Thursday.\n\nMoreover, the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is also scheduled for Wednesday, followed by a post-meeting statement and Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cAs discussed in our FOMC preview, we continue to expect the first rate cut in September, by which point we expect to have seen five straight months of better inflation news,\u201d Goldman said in a Sunday note.\n\n\u201cAfter September, we expect quarterly rate cuts to a terminal rate of 3.25-3.5%. This implies a second cut in December for a total of two cuts in 2024, four more in 2025, and two more in 2026,\u201d they added.\n\nOracle, Broadcom, Adobe due to report earnings\n\nThe Q1 reporting season is nearly over, but there are several important reports due for release, especially this week.\n\nThe three most anticipated earnings reports in the coming days are from Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE). Beyond their individual performances, these reports will provide further insights into the broader AI sector, which remains the single most important driver of US equities.\n\nFor Broadcom, a key semiconductor player, analysts at Susquehanna project \u201cn-line to slightly better results as continued AI growth, optimization of the VMware (NYSE:VMW) portfolio, and perhaps improving Storage should be offset by ongoing softness in Broadband and Enterprise Networking.\u201d\n\nTwo other reports that will likely draw attention this week are from GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG).\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBank of America: \u201cStronger growth is better as long as inflation remains in check, and we expect a strong 2H acceleration in EPS \u2013 see the Earnings Tracker report. The worst case of weak NFP and hot CPI has also been avoided, at least for now. And despite some concerns, recent macro weakness suggests that growth is simply \u201cnormalizing\u201d \u2013 see our Mid-year outlook report. If macro starts to improve, equities should be able to withstand higher levels of inflation. If NFP was just a head-fake and macro slows, inflation would have to come down to support stocks, and it likely will. If CPI cools despite hot NFP, it\u2019s risk on.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cWith macro data still mixed on both growth and inflation, a quality bias should continue to do well, in our view. We continue to fade small caps and lower quality stocks, which both underperformed late last week. EPS growth for the S&P 500 is beginning to pick up, in line with our base case view.\u201d\n\nGoldman Sachs: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the 2nd largest stock in the S&P 500 this week, with its share price surpassing $1,200. The company recently announced a 10-for-1 stock split set to take effect after today\u2019s close. Many equity investors have inquired about the impact of corporate stock splits. Based on 45 Russell 1000 stock splits since 2019, share prices typically rose by 4% in the week after the announcement, but prices did not evidence a clear reaction in subsequent weeks or around the effective date. One theory for the announcement effect is increased liquidity. However, we find that liquidity showed little change after the split took effect. Retail trading activity increased only slightly, though there were notable exceptions.\u201d\n\nRBC Capital Markets: \u201cThe S&P 500 could move to the 5,100 level at year-end 2024 if our 2024 EPS forecast of $237 proves accurate, or nearly 5,300 using bottom-up consensus EPS (which was $244.90 as of early June). This output reflects the idea that moderating inflation and a bit of interest rate relief can keep the P/E multiple of the stock market higher than many investors have believed is possible.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush: Tomorrow a new AI era for Apple begins at WWDC\n\nMorgan Stanley says a quality bias should continue to do well\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Despite the challenging macroeconomic landscape, investors are buying meme stocks as companies gain popularity again through social media and online communities. May was a particularly interesting month for meme maniacs following \u201cRoaring Kitty\u2019s\u201d return after over three years. Gains were small compared to 2021, but this may change soon.\n\nEarlier this week, the short-squeeze influencer Keith Gill scheduled a live stream for Friday, June 7, for the first time since 2021. The announcement sent GameStop (NYSE:GME) soaring. Then, an unconfirmed X post revealed Gill\u2019s stake in GME stock valued at $586 million, which added to momentum.\n\nGameStop will report its earnings on Tuesday, June 12. If it beats estimates, which seem more important than in 2021, it could act as a positive catalyst for other meme stocks. If played with caution, this may offer meme maniacs opportunities to squeeze out profits from the market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne way to identify which meme stocks may benefit is to look back at those impacted in 2021. However, this is a rather risky endeavor. Based on historical precedent, meme stocks with the highest short-squeeze potential have a better chance of soaring.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three meme stocks combining short-squeeze potential and other factors, like institutional holdings or positive news, that are ready to join the rally.\n\nMedical Properties Trust (MPW) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) has an exceptionally high short interest, at 35% of its total shares and float. Covering all short positions would require ten days, representing a risk for short sellers in case of a positive catalyst. With a substantial number of 206 million shares shorted, the MPW stock may be the next meme stock sensation.\n\nA few days ago, Medical Properties Trust announced a dividend yield of 11.19%. Despite being marginally lower than before, it is still nearly twice the industry average of 6.96%. This positive catalyst could present a significant upside as the stock price has gained over 60% since its low in January. While trading 77% below its all-time high, this signals a potential turnaround.\n\nDespite being involved in Steward\u2019s bankruptcy and rent collection issues, the company holds a niche position as a healthcare REIT that may offer stability and growth. It recently secured an $800 million loan backed by U.K. hospital properties to extend debt maturities and nourish more financial flexibility going forward. But investors may not have caught up on all that just as yet.\n\nStory continues\n\nCinemark (CNK) Cinemark movie theatre location in the Louis Joliet Mall in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nSource: LukeandKarla.Travel / Shutterstock.com\n\nCinema operator Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) has seen its stock price perform much better than meme stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). CNK stock appears to have over 24.8% of its float shorted and just nine days to cover. Despite short interest dropping 6.8% in the prior month to 27 million shares, high institutional ownership of 131% of its float presents conditions for a potentially severe short squeeze.\n\nOn the plus side, the company recently reported a net income of $25 million and adjusted EBITDA of $71 million with a healthy 12.2% margin. It ended the quarter with $789 million in cash and commitments to open 36 new screens over the next two years while peers outperformed. Management\u2019s solid execution during a challenging environment impacted by strikes could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their positions.\n\nTrading at a 63% discount to its record high of $45 while putting in quite a performance 20% higher year-to-date (YTD) signals a potential turnaround. CNK\u2019s high beta of 2.25 and low P/E ratio of 11.79x compared to the industry\u2019s 18.74x make it one of the potentially undervalued meme stocks ready to get squeezed.\n\nKohl\u2019s Corp (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nKohl\u2019s Corp (NYSE:KSS) presents a strong case for being one of the next meme stocks susceptible to a short squeeze. It has a very high short interest of 23% of its total shares and 33.7% of its float shorted. In fact, 36.36 million of its shares are shorted, and this number may increase. With approximately 125% of its float held by institutions, it\u2019s prone to a conditional short squeeze.\n\nDespite reporting a net loss for the quarter, the company managed to grow gross margins and reduce inventory. This may improve investor confidence and attract more buyers. Moreover, Kohl\u2019s Corp redeemed $113 million in notes in May and plans to stay committed to returning shareholder value with a solid quarterly dividend of 8.40%.\n\nTrading 73% below its all-time high, KSS stock has significant upside potential if sentiment improves. Its P/E ratio of 9.62x is half the industry average of 18x, presenting undervaluation and an attractive play for speculative gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Hedge funds have become wary of retail investors and have incorporated more social listening to manage the risk associated with short positions. But there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity for meme stock rallies to emulate the success of old favorites. The following are likely to play a key role in a meme stock resurgence this year.\n\nGameStop (GME)\n\nSource: Urban Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany stocks have been the subject of meme investor interest. But none have managed to become so synonymous with the investment strategy quite as much as GameStop (NYSE:GME).\n\nMuch of GameStop\u2019s fame in recent years comes from its famous, or infamous depending on your stance, short squeeze in January 2021. That resulted in a seismic rally which saw the stock catapult over 1,500% in the span of three weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDriving this rally was Keith Gill, a stock market influencer who became a cheerleader for the stock. Despite its sharp 2021 rally and collapse from its peak market capitalization of around $28 billion, Gill has allegedly retained his stake in the video game retailer. And, he recently posted a screenshot that showed the investor held $116m worth of GME shares. In total, Gill holds around 2% of all GameStop shares.\n\nThe fame of the 2021 meme stock rally has sent Keith Gill\u2019s followers on X to 1.4 million, while the Reddit group r/WallStreetBets now has 16 million members. This stronger united front among retail investors could see future GameStop rallies command far more interest.\n\nWhat about the stock\u2019s fundamentals? GameStop\u2019s performance is a mixed bag. The retailer announced a 19.44% drop in revenue to $1.8 billion in its Q1 of 2024 earnings compared to the year prior but a 30.91% jump in profit to $63.1 million.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Person holding cellphone with website of US company AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. on screen in front of logo. AMC stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile GameStop commands most limelight when it comes to discussing meme stocks, it\u2019s actually AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) that underwent the strongest rally in 2021.\n\nDuring its peak in June 2021, AMC\u2019s year-to-date (YTD) growth surpassed 2,600% in a short squeeze that spanned more than a month.\n\nCrucially, we\u2019ve seen plenty of evidence that AMC Entertainment is strategic. The company knows how to cash in on retail interest and use it to generate a more sustainable business model.\n\nDuring its 2021 rally, AMC opted to use its growth to build a $2 billion war chest focused on cinema upgrades and new leases. Also, the company announced shareholder perks like free popcorn to encourage investors to hold the stock for longer.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, AMC Entertainment\u2019s 2024 rally has been no different. The cinema chain raised around $250 million of new equity capital through the sale of 72.5 million shares in an at-the-market equity offering launched in March.\n\nIn addition, AMC posted relatively resilient Q1 earnings for the year, with total revenues decreasing slightly by 0.3% to $951.4 million. Also standing out was a significant improvement in net loss to $163.5 million, a reduction of $72 million over the previous year.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnlike the other stocks on this list, BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) has so far failed to ignite retail interest in 2024. The stock experienced a weaker 2021 rally and suffered losses of almost 20% over the first two quarters of this year.\n\nBlackBerry\u2019s fall from grace has also been the most jarring. The mobile phone manufacturer had a strong market presence until it failed to adapt to the age of the smartphone and Apple\u2019s iPhone dominance. This has made the stock a popular choice among meme investors for its nostalgic qualities.\n\nHowever, BlackBerry may be an example of a meme stock that can double up as an innovative tech firm once again. June 2024 saw BlackBerry announce a partnership with Databricks to deliver strong AI and data-focused solutions in the world of cybersecurity.\n\nAlso, the firm\u2019s Q1 revenue of $373 million points to a stock that has plenty of room for growth should it begin to enter the artificial intelligence (AI) market with next-generation solutions across different industries.\n\nTherefore, BlackBerry may have long been the meme stock that\u2019s lacking the same level of retail love shown to the likes of GameStop and AMC Entertainment. However, its commitment to embracing emerging technology could add more value as a buy option for retail investors ahead of a prospective 2024 market rally.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nSometimes there is no middle ground in the cutthroat world of business.\n\nYou are either a winner.\n\nOr you are a loser.\n\nA winner wins because they are doing something better than everyone else, usually over a long stretch of time. Through a mixture of perseverance, creativity, and executional excellence, the winner builds on their success and widens their lead.\n\nThere is a dose of luck to this too.\n\nA loser, well, does the complete opposite of this playbook.\n\nI return with this simple message following another wild week of trading in shares of GameStop (GME) \u2014 one dominated by an unverified social media account allegedly led by a guy known for a red headband, lame T-shirts, and a penchant for flexing his alleged dollars in a trading account.\n\nGameStop stinks. It's 100% going to be a long-term loser. Maybe 110%.\n\nAnd you know what, friends?\n\nTo reiterate this point, I'm not going to use a lick of the sophisticated analysis I taught myself while covering 55 retail companies as an independent stock analyst. I will do two things.\n\nFirst, point out that the company's first quarter sales cratered 29% year over year. The company lost $32.3 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $50.5 million a year earlier.\n\nThe business trends are getting WORSE!\n\nHere are those numbers via the company's laughably brief earnings release Friday morning.\n\nSecond, I'm going to link to the company's latest annual report here, then add these rapid-fire observations:\n\nThe company refuses to aggressively shrink a store base that numbers 4,169 locations worldwide. Shops that sell similar products such as Walmart (WMT) are aggressively investing in AI and same-day delivery services \u2014 practically making visits to competing stores a waste of time. The company is losing gobs of money amid a persistent, structural downtrend in sales. Margins are under pressure, and have been. The company is overly reliant on consoles \u2014 56.8% of sales came from hardware and accessories last year. But console sales face an increasingly grim outlook as PCs and smartphones compete for market share. The three objectives listed under the \"business strategy\" section \u2014 establish retail excellence, achieve profitability, and leverage brand value \u2014 aren't being consistently executed on.\n\nYou GME fans may not want to admit this, but fundamentally analyzing a company still matters. That's how the mechanisms of the market work. That's how true wealth is built.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You can never lose sight of the fundamentals,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on my \"Opening Bid\" podcast (video above), adding that GameStop's top and bottom lines will likely stay under pressure. Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill toils away on a Yahoo Finance GameStop chart on Friday, making his return to streaming about stocks on his YouTube channel. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nIt's why this stock has gone from a high of $66 when \"activist investor\" turned CEO Ryan Cohen joined the board in January 2021 to a low of $9.95 in mid-April, before the latest bout of Keith Gill shenanigans. Shares closed at $28.22 on Friday.\n\nCohen has done squat to reverse the company's future trajectory. In the meantime, the performance of the company has been terrible. I stand by everything I wrote in my open letter to Cohen on June 9, 2023, when the stock was trading at $23.\n\nIn fact, I'll take this a step further \u2014 I personally invite Cohen to Yahoo Finance's big fall Invest conference (distinguished speaker list from 2023 here) to debate me on the main stage about what in the world he is doing with GameStop.\n\nRyan, the event is Nov. 12 in New York City. My email is below.\n\nYou owe it to your legion of supporters to discuss what you are doing with their public support and dollars.\n\nAnd don't message me that Cohen has saved the company with its recent $933.4 million cash grab via a share offering and another $75 million planned offering disclosed on Friday. All this does is ensure the company could keep buying inventory for a few years while also exiting a plethora of leases for stores that most of America doesn't visit.\n\nWhat does winning look like in the consumer space?

        "title": "Inflation reading and a Fed meeting: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks closed another week near record highs as the latest jobs report showed a US labor market that's cooling, but not at a pace that economists find concerning.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up about 2.3%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.3%.\n\nNext week's highlights include the June Federal Reserve meeting and a key inflation reading on Wednesday. The first reading of consumer sentiment for June is also expected on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, Big Tech will kick off the week with Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split and Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developer's Conference both set for Monday. A vote on Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package is expected on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, chaotic moves in GameStop stock (GME) have continued to garner investor attention as the return of Keith Gill, a popular leader of the 2021 meme stock frenzy, has reignited interest.\n\nThe Fed, inflation, and the path for interest rates\n\nFriday's May jobs report showed more job additions than expected, adding fuel to a common narrative from Federal Reserve officials that the labor market remains on solid enough footing to keep interest rates at their current restrictive levels. And to economists, the latest data just emphasizes that the Fed needs to see inflation decline further before cutting rates.\n\n\"Policymakers will need to see a few slower inflation reports over the summer in order to start cutting rates by the fall,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a research note on Friday.\n\nThe next update on inflation is expected on Wednesday morning with the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street expects an annual gain of 3.4% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, unchanged from April. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, down from 0.3% in April.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.5% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.6% increase seen in April. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, unchanged from the prior month.\n\nThe release will come just hours before the Fed's latest policy decision, where markets largely expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged. This pushes the main focus to the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) \u2014 including its \"dot plot,\" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future \u2014 as well as commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli expects the Fed to project a median of two interest rate cuts this year in its dot plot, down from three in March. As far as Powell's commentary is concerned, Feroli believes Powell's presser will be perceived \"dovish.\"\n\n\"At the press conference, we expect Chair Powell will express confidence that the economy is still on the right path and that the FOMC can be patient in gaining confidence that inflation is heading toward two percent,\" Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nFewer cuts, no problem\n\nPrior to Friday's jobs report, the market was pricing in two rate cuts this year. After the release, that number teetered between one and two, per Bloomberg data.\n\nNotably, though, that shift and a 15-basis-point jump in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) to 4.43% did little to deter investor optimism as the S&P 500 closed near a record high on Friday.\n\nNew York Life Investments economist and chief market strategist Lauren Goodwin told Yahoo Finance this could be because the stronger-than-expected jobs report is good news for the economy, and \"markets have been very focused on growth.\"\n\nShe added that, given the solid earnings backdrop expected for the rest of this year and a solid growth trajectory for the economy, markets can take the Fed repricing \"in stride.\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell listens at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the Treasury Department on May 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) (Kent Nishimura via Getty Images)\n\nApple's WWDC\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to kick off on Monday, with investors expecting more details to be released on the tech giant's push into generative AI.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the year, the stock has rallied more than 7% over the past month leading into the event and recently turned positive for the year.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has a full preview of the event.\n\nMore Nvidia stock\n\nNvidia shares are set to begin trading on Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock price from its Friday close of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nTypically, stock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.\n\nMusk's money\n\nTesla's annual shareholder meeting is slated for after the market close on Thursday, and the most pressing issue will be the shareholder vote on a potential $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he's advised investors to pay close attention to the vote, as it will have \"significance to the long-term strategic direction of the company.\"\n\nHe added, \"While impossible to predict the outcome, we expect the event could potentially drive material volatility in TSLA shares.\"\n\nIn a survey of 109 investors, Morgan Stanley found most investors feel that approving Musk's pay package would send Tesla shares higher, while a vote not to approve would weigh on the stock. Entering the meeting, Tesla shares are down nearly 30% this year.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, May (3.26% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, May (89.5 expected, 89.7 previously)\n\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Casey's (CASY), Oracle (ORCL)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.3% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, May (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, May (+3.4% expected, +3.4% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, May (+3.5% expected, +3.6% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, May (+0.5% previously); MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending June 7 (-5.2% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change to range of 5.25% to 5.5% expected)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), Vera Bradley (VRA)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending June 8 (223,000 expected, 229,000 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.5% previously); PPI, year-over-year, May (+2.5% expected, 2.2% previously);\n\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Lovesac (LOVE), RH (RH), Signet Jewelers (SIG)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: University of Michigan consumer sentiment, June preliminary (72.8 expected, 69.1 prior) Import prices, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.9% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, May (+0.2% expected, +0.5% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Ready for Quick Gains? 7 Top Short-Squeeze Stocks to Watch Now",
        "content": "Retail investor interest in short squeeze stocks has grown considerably since the \u201cmeme stock\u201d phenomenon of 2021. However, a stock doesn\u2019t need to gain the \u201cmeme king\u201d popularity of a GameStop (NYSE:GME) or an AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) to become a profitable squeeze trade for investors.\n\nIn many situations, all it takes is two things. First, a high level of short interest. What constitutes high short interest? Think 20%, 30%, 40%, or more of outstanding float sold short.\n\nSecond, to trigger a squeeze, typically what\u2019s required is the announcement of unforeseen positive news about the heavily-shorted stock in question. Why? As a sweeping development changes the story behind a stock, the crowded short-side scrambles to cover positions, causing the \u201csqueeze\u201d to occur.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are seven stocks that currently have a high level of short interest, and that based on various factors, could become short squeeze stocks in the near-future.\n\nArbor Realty Trust (ABR) the Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) logo on a web browser, magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nArbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership of commercial and residential mortgages. REITs like Arbor are often referred to as mortgage REITs (mREITs). With the surge in interest rates putting the squeeze on mREIT net interest margins, Wall Street\u2019s \u201csmart money\u201d has been betting against many major names in the space.\n\nABR stock is no exception. Far from it, in fact. Short interest currently totals 41% of outstanding float. A big reason why Arbor Realty Trust in particular has been a short-seller target may have to do with the myriad of allegations laid against the mREIT, by vocal short seller Viceroy Research. However, Arbor\u2019s management has refuted these allegations. Not only that, Arbor has clearly been successful in navigating sector challenges.\n\nAs Seeking Alpha commentator Larry Hall noted last month, the mREIT\u2019s management has been successful at mitigating risk, maintaining Arbor\u2019s profitability, and more importantly, its dividend. While not certain, a continuation of this resilience could prove Viceroy and the rest of the shorts wrong, perhaps turning ABR into one of the short squeeze stocks. In the meantime, contrarians can sit back and collect ABR\u2019s 12.13% dividend.\n\nKohl\u2019s (KSS) Image of Kohl's logo on a Kohl's store\n\nSource: Sundry Photography/Shutterstock.com\n\nIn prior coverage of Kohl\u2019s (NYSE:KSS), I\u2019ve taken a bearish stance on the department store chain\u2019s shares. Largely, due to the risk of a posssible dividend cut down the road. At current prices, KSS sports a forward dividend yield of 8.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, as inflation and soft demand decimate bricks and mortar retail profitability, it may prove challenging to sustain this high level of payout. I\u2019m clearly not the only one leaning bearish about the future prospect of KSS stock. Shares are among the most heavily-shorted, with short interest totaling 33.58% of outstanding float. Having said all of this, with shares back down near pandemic-era levels, the worst may just well now be fully priced into KSS, and then some.\n\nThe latest plunge for Kohl\u2019s shares happened late last month, following the company\u2019s latest earnings release. The retailer reported an unexpected loss, and provided weak guidance for the full year. However, if next quarter or a few quarters from now, Kohl\u2019s reports \u201cbetter than feared\u201d numbers, or if an improving macro backdrop leads to an upward revision to forecasts? It\u2019s easy to see KSS getting squeezed back to higher prices.\n\nMedical Properties Trust (MPW) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nSource: venusvi / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) is a stock that in hindsight I was overly bearish about. While the healthcare-focused REIT had its share of big issues and risks, looking back it\u2019s clear that said issues were more than accounted for, with MPW is stuck in \u201cpenny stock territory,\u201d or at prices below $5 per share.\n\nAlthough playing out gradually, one can say that the MPW stock has been one of the short squeeze stocks this year. Promising news regarding a problem tenant, along with other positive developments has helped to boost bullishness and increase confidence that Medical Properties Trust can maintain its current dividend. At today\u2019s prices, MPW\u2019s quarterly dividend gives the stock a forward yield of 10.66%.\n\nBut even after benefiting from a slow-and-steady squeeze, additional spikes could be in the cards for MPW. Short interest remains very high, at 35.07% of outstanding float. Tenant issues could continue to enter the rearview mirror. The REIT could also make further progress assuaging concerns about debt, through efforts like its recent $800 million refinancing. In the next earnings release, stronger-than-expected results and upbeat guidance may result in yet another squeeze for shares.\n\nPhathom Pharmaceuticals (PHAT) Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.\n\nSource: Billion Photos / Shutterstock\n\nBiotech firm Phathom Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:PHAT) develops and commercializes treatment for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The key candidate in Phathom\u2019s pipeline is Voquenza. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Larry Ramer noted last month, the company has already obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Voquenza\u2019s use as a treatment for erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nHowever, as Ramer also noted, obtaining approval for Voquenza as a treatment for non-erosive GERD will be the real needle-moving catalyst for PHAT stock, if it happens. The short-side clearly does not think it will happen. That\u2019s why short interest for PHAT currently stands at 28.21% of outstanding float. Yet while this skepticism may suggest high uncertainty over FDA approval, the risk could be far outweighed by the upside if Voquenza gets the non-erosive GERD green light.\n\nPHAT has cratered in price since 2021, when it traded for prices north of $45 per share. With millions of Americans being treated for acid-related stomach issues, label expansion for Voquenza, selling for $650 per 30-dose bottle, could make it a blockbuster drug. This, coupled with the short squeezing that\u2019s likely to occur upon gaining non-erosive GERD regulatory approval, could send PHAT back toward prior price levels.\n\nChildren\u2019s Place (PLCE) Outside view of a the Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE) storefront\n\nSource: rblfmr/Shutterstock.com\n\nChildren\u2019s Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) is a stock that I have previously noted as having high squeeze potential. Last August, I argued that stronger results could send PLCE, then trading at around $27 per share, back up to triple-digit price levels. Unfortunately, better results have thus far failed to arrive.\n\nInstead of rising fourfold, PLCE stock has instead fallen by around 57.4%. Yet while I clearly made the wrong call, it may have just been a case of taking a bullish stance way too early. It\u2019s important to note that, while down considerably from last year, PLCE stock has bounced back strongly from its 52-week low of $6.58 per share. Mostly, due to Mithaq Capital, PLCE\u2019s majority shareholder, providing the company with more liquidity to fund its e-commerce transformation.\n\nThe short side may stay crowded for now, with nearly a quarter of PLCE\u2019s outstanding float sold short. However, much like the aforementioned Mithaq news caused an extended squeeze during April and May, similarly-positive developments may results in similarly outsized moves higher for hard-hit PLCE shares.\n\nB Riley (RILY) a magnifying glass enlarges the B. Riley (RILY) logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nB. Riley (NASDAQ:RILY) is another name better described as one of the short squeeze stocks, rather than a short squeeze stock in the making. Back in late April, shares in this heavily-shorted investment bank and holding company went to the moon, thanks to a legal-related announcement.\n\nThe reason why so many investors were betting against RILY stock, had to do with B. Riley\u2019s association with a financier currently facing allegations of securities fraud. To address and remedy this issue, B. Riley initiated an independent investigation. On April 24, this investigation concluded that there was no involvement or knowledge on B. Riley\u2019s part, in the financier\u2019s alleged activities. As a result, shares surged, as the long side squeezed the short side out of positions.\n\nShort interest with RILY has come down since then, but remains at very elevated levels. Currently, short interest totals 51.8% of outstanding float. B. Riley has also given back much of its short squeeze gains, yet I wouldn\u2019t rule out a possible further squeezing down the road. Back in April, InvestorPlace\u2019s Steve Booyens noted many potential growth opportunities for B. Riley\u2019s investment banking unit. Fiscal results for the company could improve, sparking additional squeezes higher.\n\nVital Energy (VTLE) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy. Oil & Gas Stocks to Avoid\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nVital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) is an independent energy exploration and production (E&P) company. Vital\u2019s focus is mainly on oil and gas projects located in the Permian Basin region of the southwestern United States.\n\nThe Permian of course contains one of the richest deposits of fossil fuels in the U.S., and Vital is generating significant cash flow from its operations. Even so, this hasn\u2019t stopped VTLE stock from having a crowded short side. Short interest currently totals 31.97% of outstanding float. One reason as to why the shorts are betting against Vital may have to do with the E&P\u2019s highly-leveraged balance sheet. The company has around $2.24 billion in outstanding long-term debt.\n\nHowever, with Vital increasing production, organically and through acquisitions, it\u2019s not just wishful thinking that\u2019s driving sell-side forecasts calling for major earnings growth next year. If it becomes more clear that results will live up to these forecasts, which call for 31.6% earnings growth next year, VTLE could soon become one of the short squeeze stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meme stock trader Keith Gill, aka \"Roaring Kitty,\" failed to rally investors around GameStop with his first livestream in three years on Friday as the stock slumped 40%.\n\nGameStop shares plummeted after the video game retailer unveiled a share sale to raise up to $3 billion. Gill, meanwhile, told nearly 600,000 viewers on his YouTube livestream to bet on CEO Ryan Cohen \"and his crew\" while joking about memes and issuing disclaimers that retail traders could \"lose it all.\"\n\nGill said his \"aggressive style of investing, it is almost certainly not suitable for you all.\"\n\nGameStop reported its quarterly results four days ahead of schedule on Friday, which sent the stock shooting up 50% before Gill posted about his upcoming livestream.\n\n\u2018ROARING KITTY\u2019 SAYS GAMESTOP TO BENEFIT FROM \u2018RYAN COHEN AND CREW\u2019 Traders work under signage for GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, on Aug. 8, 2022.\n\nThe volatile movement in GameStop, AMC Entertainment and other stocks popular on Reddit show retail traders still have a big appetite for taking risks on struggling companies \u2014 investments inspired by nostalgia and internet jokes rather than good business sense.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"You post a couple of memes, you post a couple of screenshots, and everyone loses their minds,\" Gill said on the livestream, wearing a headband and white sunglasses.\n\nGameStop finished trading at $28.22 after it was halted several times ahead of and during the much-anticipated livestream.\n\nInvestors exchanged $10 billion worth of GameStop shares, more than any other stock on Wall Street except Nvidia and Apple, according to LSEG data reported by Reuters.\n\nGAMESTOP SHARES VOLATILE AFTER EARNINGS AND AHEAD OF \u2018ROARING KITTY\u2019 LIVE STREAM GameStop logo is seen in front of the displayed Reddit logo in this illustration taken Feb. 2, 2021.\n\nGill expressed confidence in Cohen's ability to pull GameStop through the \"transformation stage\" he believes the company has entered.\n\n\"I\u2019m not promising anything, but over the long term here, I think he seems like the type of guy,\" he said. \"He seems like he has those characteristics in the way he approaches this, seems like he might be able to do this but, again, that\u2019s not a guarantee.\"\n\nIN 2021, Gill's advocacy for GameStop sent its shares soaring by as much as 1,600% before they came crashing back to earth. He became an internet hero to some and an annoyance for others on Wall Street.\n\n\"This is what he does. He discusses the fundamentals, he likes the stock, he memes, he drinks, he rambles,\" user SteveRogers 7 commented on Reddit after Gill's livestream. \"You want him to tell you to go and pump GME? That is not gonna happen, stay disappointed.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGAMESTOP SHARES SURGE AFTER 'ROARING KITTY' POST Keith Gill, known on Reddit under the pseudonym DeepFuckingValue and as Roaring Kitty, is seen on a fragment of a youtube video displayed on a smartphone screen in front of GameStop logo.\n\nIn Friday's report, GameStop said it saw net sales of $881.8 million and a net loss of $32.3 million for the first quarter. The former represented a year-over-year decline of 28.7%, while the latter was an improvement.\n\nThe retailer reported $1.083 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\nThe company also said it would sell up to 75 million shares to raise capital, but did not say when it would do so.\n\nLast month, GameStop said it made more than $900 million by selling 45 million shares after meme-stocks rallied thanks to investor enthusiasm.\n\n\"Retail traders are growing in force and inserting themselves into the conversation like never before. These investors truly have a seat at the table now and need to be paid their due attention by public companies for their influence,\" Don Montanaro, president of discount brokerage Firstrade, told Reuters.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:'Roaring Kitty' could not save GameStop as meme stock tanks\n\nView comments",

        "content": "No matter which side you were on during the initial meme stock mania in 2021, we can all agree that the market felt like the Wild West.\n\nOut of the bunch, GameStop GME was the most popular, shaking the market violently with a short squeeze of a magnitude rarely seen.\n\nOf course, other meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment AMC, also became a nightmare for short-sellers, causing violent price swings.\n\nAnd as we\u2019re all aware, they\u2019re back. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the mania.\n\nRoaring Kitty Returns\n\nRoaring Kitty (Keith Gill) was the prominent figure in the initial 2021 meme craze, helping kick off the period by shifting attention toward short sellers. An epic short squeeze ensued in GameStop shares, with other heavily-shorted stocks, such as AMC Entertainment, also causing pain for short sellers.\n\nThe excitement subsided over the years until \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 made a social media post some time back, breaking years of silence. Meme-stock traders clearly heard the call, with GME shares seeing extreme volatility.\n\nGameStop\u2019s Current Standing\n\nGameStop reported quarterly results this morning, with sales down considerably from the year-ago period. Shares faced pressure following the release, with GME also announcing a $75 million at-the-market offering. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company\u2019s outlook has shifted lower, with the stock presently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A short squeeze has fueled the recent action, certainly not reflective of the company\u2019s current earnings outlook.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOnce heavily-shorted stocks begin rising, it kicks off a vicious cycle for shorts, who are forced to cover their positions and buy back the shares they borrowed. This leads to massive losses for shorts that cannot cover their positions, while traders enjoy the rollercoaster.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what happened in 2021 with meme stocks such as GameStop GME and AMC Entertainment AMC.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Memestock ringleader Keith Gill, known online as Roaring Kitty, made his first on-camera appearance in over three years in a livestream midday on Friday, sending GameStop stock down over 40% from this morning\u2019s peak and forcing exchanges to halt trading eight times in a single hour for volatility as traders sent shares up and down over the course of the nearly hour-long stream.\n\nOver the course of the rambling, 50-minute call, Gill expounded on his faith in GameStop\u2019s corporate strategy and its new CEO, Ryan Cohen, and confirmed that screenshots posted to his Reddit account earlier this week displaying a brokerage account with over 5 million GameStop call options were indeed his.\n\n\u201c[GameStop] becomes a bet on the veterans, you know\u2014in particular, of course, Ryan Cohen,\u201d Gill said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen enough from him to think he\u2019s got a good head on his shoulders.\u201d\n\nGill was instrumental in GameStop\u2019s initial surge in January 2021, when his Reddit posts and livestreams helped generate enough interest from memestock traders to push the ailing video-game retailer\u2019s stock price up well over 1,000%. After disappearing for three years, Gill\u2019s Twitter account began posting cryptic images and movie stills earlier this month, igniting another rally that more than doubled GameStop\u2019s share price at its peak.\n\nWhen Gill announced that he would be appearing on a livestream this morning, GameStop\u2019s share price jumped nearly 30%\u2014making Gill a billionaire on paper based on the value of his call options. However, the stock retreated by 25% by the time the stream began, and fell a further 12% during the stream, erasing his prior gains.\n\nGill commented on reports that brokerage platform E*Trade was considering banning him from the platform, using his browser\u2019s HTML function to remove the E*Trade logo from his account\u2019s dashboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen those headlines, E*Trade,\u201d Gill said. \u201cI\u2019m checking in every day.

        "content": "Keith Gill, the financial influencer known as Roaring Kitty, made his first appearance on a YouTube live stream in three years on Friday, and he had a bone to pick with his brokerage firm. During his session, Gill called out E-Trade, which reportedly considered banning him from trading earlier this week after he revealed positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the meme stock GameStop.\n\n\"I've seen those headlines,\" joked Gill, pulling up a webpage showing his portfolio and deleting the E-Trade logo using his browser's developer tools. \"Don't make me remove it.\"\n\nGill's nearly one-hour stream came a few weeks after his X account posted a GameStop-related meme, driving speculation about whether the vaunted internet figure had really returned after years of speculation, and kicking off a rally in GameStop prices. Without any verbal confirmation from Gill himself, who would communicate through often absurdist YouTube livestreams during the peak of the meme-stock trading mania in 2021, some wondered whether he had sold his social media accounts or been hacked.\n\nThat changed on Sunday, after Gill posted his positions using his signature Reddit account, DeepFuckingValue, revealing that he was holding positions in GameStop shares and call options that, at their peak, had him worth over half a billion dollars. After market close on Thursday, he posted a new screenshot of his positions and added a live stream scheduled for Friday afternoon to his YouTube channel\u2014his first since the pandemic era.\n\nIn the money\n\nHundreds of thousands of people piled into the stream on Friday, with the sidebar chat flying with new comments. After a 20-minute wait, a sizzle reel of cat clips aired, followed by a long scroll of financial disclosure text. Roaring Kitty was back.\n\nInternet culture around meme stocks has receded from the boom days of the pandemic, with stimulus checks long spent and the economy in a precarious state. But Gill's return has breathed new life into the strange nooks of social media platforms like Discord, Reddit, and YouTube, where amateur investors trade memes and financial advice, often with the spirit of sticking it to institutional traders like large hedge funds.\n\nDuring Friday's livestream, Gill claimed that he was not working with anybody on his new, massive position, with some skeptics accusing him of partnering with GameStop or hedge funds. \"What weirdo spends their free time working on memes\u2014is someone else doing that?\" Gill said. \"This is me, I'm the one active on my accounts.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring his often rambling one-man show, in which Gill doubled down on his support for GameStop due to his belief in its CEO Ryan Cohen, interest seemed to wane among his audience\u2014and other investors. Despite the stock halting in trading because of volatility, its price still slumped, in part impacted by the company's early reporting of its quarterly results on Friday. At the time of publication, shares are trading around $28 after reaching a high of nearly $50 this morning.\n\nWhile Gill may not yet be a millionaire, he still has reason to celebrate\u2014his call options have a strike price of $20, meaning he is still \"in the money.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

However, as of late, gamma squeezes are occurring more often than ever on Wall Street, so investors should educate themselves on the term.\n\nWhat is a Gamma Squeeze?\n\nIn options markets, a gamma squeeze occurs when a stock swiftly rallies due to market maker hedging.\n\nOptions 101\n\nTo clearly understand gamma squeezes, investors must first have a handle on the inner workings of the options market. Options are financial derivatives that provide the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call options) or sell (put options) of an underlying asset at a specified price before the expiration date.\n\nOptions Greeks\n\nThough options are roughly correlated to the underlying asset\u2019s price movements, options pricing is a bit more complex than equity pricing, for example. Option Greeks are a group of gauges that allow traders to understand how an option price is expected to change. However, it is critical for investors to understand that equities can impact options pricing and vice versa.\n\nDelta\n\nDelta measures how much an option price will change with every $1 move in the stock. Envision delta as the speedometer on your car. If your speedometer displays 40 miles per hour, that would be akin to your delta.\n\nGamma\n\nGamma is a metric that gauges the rate of change in the delta relative to every $1 move in the stock. For example, 100 shares of stock would have a 0 gamma and a 100 delta. Using the same example from earlier, if you speed up from 40 to 50 MPH, your gamma is 10. Gamma represents the change in delta.\n\nAnatomy of a Gamma Squeeze: The GameStop Example\n\nTo explain a gamma squeeze, I will use the most famous example, GameStop (GME). I will also use metaphors to make the concept easy to understand. \u00a0A gamma squeeze has four ingredients:\n\n1. A Flurry of Call Buying: Traders buy a plethora of out-of-the-money call options. In the case of GameStop, the call buying was largely attributed to speculative retail investors who were members of the Reddit (RDDT) \u201csubreddit\u201d community called \u201cr/WallStreetBets.\u201d Community members coalesced to take advantage of the high short squeeze in GME and orchestrate a short squeeze.\n\n2. Hedging Market Makers: Market makers are mostly Wall Street firms that provide liquidity to various markets, including the options market. In the options market, these entities provide liquidity by allowing traders to buy and sell options. They continuously quote buy and sell prices for options, better known as the bid-ask spread. Market makers implement historical stats and probability to profit from the difference between the bid and ask.\n\nStory continues\n\nFuel added to the Fire: When a market maker sells call options, they need to hedge by purchasing underlying shares because if the stock rises, they must deliver stock to option buyers. In other words, the more call options market makers sell, the more stock they need to buy. In the case of GME, the number of shares market makers needed to purchase was dramatically increased due to the increased popularity of 0DTE (zero days until expiration) options and far out-of-the-money calls.\n\n3. Price Momentum and Feedback Loop: The shares purchased by market makers drive the stock higher. A rising stock price leads to a higher delta, forcing market makers to buy even more stock to manage risk through hedging. The chain of events sparks a feedback loop that includes:\n\nA. Heavy Call Buying\n\nB. Rapidly Increasing Delta\n\nC. Stock Purchases by Market Makers to Hedge Positions and Manage Risk\n\nBeyond the feedback loop mentioned, GameStop\u2019s gamma squeeze in late 2020 was particularly extreme. Short sellers were forced to cover as the stock rose, and retail investors jumped on board to take speculative bets. Remember, at the time, many people were confined to their homes and flush with cash thanks to stimulus checks handed out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, discount broker Robinhood (HOOD) had just become the first stock broker to employ zero-commission equities trading. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGamma Squeezes: A Word of Caution\n\nInvestors who decide to trade a gamma squeeze should be extremely careful. In fact, for most investors, spectating is the best course of action because:\n\nHyper Volatility: Gamma squeezes result in massive price ranges and overnight gaps.\n\nTraders are not in Control: GME and other gamma squeezes like AMC (AMC) add risk to the equation that is impossible for traders to account for. For instance, Keith Gill, known in online trading circles as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d rose to fame on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit. Social media posts by Gill can often move a stock like GME by 20% or more. Furthermore, stock exchanges and regulators can halt stock for various reasons\n\nGamma Squeezes are Not Sustainable: Gamma squeezes are unsustainable because they are a phenomenon that is detached from fundamentals. Like a game of musical chairs, latecomers bear the brunt of the pain when the stock crashes downward.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA gamma squeeze occurs when heavy call buying sparks a feedback loop in a stock, causing a rapid price advance. Though gamma squeezes cause rapid price advances, they are very risky to navigate.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "GameStop (GME) stock fell as much as 17% in early trading Friday after the video game retailer reported quarterly results that missed analyst estimates and announced a stock sale just hours before a highly anticipated livestream from \"Roaring Kitty,\" an alias used in the past by bullish retail investor Keith Gill.\n\nFor the first quarter, GameStop posted an adjusted loss of $0.12 per share versus estimates of a loss of $0.09. Net sales dropped 29% to $882 million versus analyst estimates of $995.5 million. Wall Street was expecting the quarterly results later this month.\n\nThe company also filed to sell up to 75 million additional shares. Last month, GameStop sold 45 million shares, bringing in about $930 million in proceeds.\n\nThe announcements came on the heels of the stock's 47% surge in the prior session after \"Roaring Kitty\" scheduled a YouTube live stream for noon Eastern Time on Friday.\n\nThis would mark Gill's first live appearance on the channel since the investor helped ignite the meme stock rally in 2021 via his bullish videos and posts about the video game retailer.\n\nAfter the market close on Thursday, \"DeepF***ingValue,\" a Reddit handle also previously associated with Gill, posted a screenshot purportedly showing the user's portfolio ballooning to $586 million, including GameStop stock holdings and unexercised options positions.\n\nEarlier this week, the same user revealed a $175 million bet on GameStop. Shares surged following that post too.\n\nGameStop shares have been on a rollercoaster over the past month as Gill reemerged across social media, prompting some calls that Gill should be investigated.\n\n\"The fact that this individual bought short dated call options on GameStop and then tweeted for the first time in forever \u2014knowing full well that these Reddit WallStreetBets folks would then drive the stock price up... it is shady,\" Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba told Yahoo Finance on Thursday afternoon.\n\nEarlier this week, the office of the top securities regulator in Massachusetts confirmed to Reuters it has opened a probe into \"Roaring Kitty\u2019s\" GameStop trades.\n\nLate Monday, following the user's emergence over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported that executives at Morgan Stanley's (MS) E-Trade platform were considering kicking off an account tied to the screenshot. Shares of GameStop fell roughly 5% the next day.\n\nGameStop rallied 180% over a span of two days in mid-May after \"Roaring Kitty\" posted for the first time on X, formerly known as Twitter, since 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast month's rally was short-lived, and analysts have warned that the meme action this time around is a far cry from the level of retail inflows seen three years ago.

        "title": "Who is Keith Gill, the online influencer sending GameStop shares soaring again?",
        "content": "By Michelle Price\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Keith Gill, the office worker who shot to notoriety after his online personas and bullish bets on GameStop sparked a retail trading frenzy, appears to be re-emerging from obscurity.\n\nKnown as \"Roaring Kitty\" on YouTube and \"DeepF***ingValue\" on Reddit's popular WallStreetBets, Gill was a key figure in the so-called \"Reddit rally\" in which shares of GameStop surged 1600% at one point in Jan. 2021, crushing hedge funds that had bet against the videogame retailer.\n\nBut after drawing congressional and regulatory scrutiny for his role in the extraordinary saga, Gill quickly disappeared, albeit much richer thanks to his GameStop investment which at one point reached $48 million in value.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor three years, Gill's accounts on YouTube, X, and Reddit lay dormant. He did no media interviews and when film-makers came knocking he declined to participate in their projects.\n\nThen out of the blue Gill appeared in recent weeks to resurface online, sending GameStop's shares soaring once again.\n\nOn Monday, they rose 21% after Gill\u2019s Reddit account posted a screenshot showing a $116 million bet on the stock. On Thursday, they surged almost 50% after Gill's YouTube account scheduled a livestream for 12 p.m. ET (1600 GMT) on Friday.\n\nThe post, featuring Gill's trademark cat, sparked a deluge of excited messages from his followers, many of whom have likened the social media phenomenon to a David who took on Wall Street's Goliaths and won.\n\n\"I will watch this screen without blinking all night,\" a user with the handle Clay DeNicola posted on Gill's YouTube channel on Thursday.\n\nGill has not responded to multiple attempts by Reuters to contact him.\n\nBorn in 1986 to a truck driver and nurse, Gill grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts. \"I grew up playing videogames and shopping at GameStop,\" he told lawmakers during a 2021 hearing.\n\nHe graduated from Stonehill College in 2009 and between 2010 and 2014 worked at a start-up where he tried to build software to help investors analyze shares, according to his testimony.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"My salary never exceeded $40,000, but I did learn something about investing. I learned how to do the tedious work of digging through a company's financials and focusing on its real long-term value,\" he said.\n\n\"TOO LATE TO BUY?\"\n\nWhile unemployed in 2017 Gill, a husband and father, began analyzing stocks and investing his savings, an interest he \"pursued passionately\" even after taking on a marketing and financial education job at MassMutual in April 2019.\n\nWhen in early June GameStop's shares fell on worse-than-expected earnings, Gill spied an opportunity. Believing the stock was trading below its fair value, he bought GME options and from there continued to add to his position, he said.\n\nGill began sharing his positions on WallStreetBets in September 2019, posting a screenshot indicating he had invested $53,000 in GameStop.\n\nWith exuberant YouTube streams in which Gill frequently wore a bright red pirate bandana as he made the bull case for GameStop, and Reddit posts touting his positions, Gill helped to attract a flood of retail cash into the beleaguered bricks-and-mortar retailer.\n\nBy late Jan. 2021, Gill was up over 4,000% on stock and options in the company, with his GameStop position plus cash worth nearly $48 million, according to his posts.\n\nIn an April 16, 2021 WallStreetBets post, which would be his last for three years, Gill shared screen shots showing he had exercised call options on GameStop to acquire 50,000 more shares in the retailer, sparking thousands of comments lauding the punchy move.\n\nNow that Gill is back in the limelight, he is also back in the crosshairs. The Massachusetts securities regulator, which had opened and closed a probe into Gill, has said it is again reviewing his activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also reviewing his trades, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe agency has declined to comment.\n\nSome have accused Gill of causing huge losses for investors who followed him into GameStop, a claim he has long denied.\n\n\"I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks,\" he told lawmakers, adding his investment thesis focused purely on GameStop's fundamentals.\n\nStill, on Thursday many of his followers were contemplating buying more GameStop shares, with one handle George Black asking the group: \"Is it too late to buy?\"\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",

        "content": "GameStop managed to narrow its losses in the first quarter, but the video game retailer's revenue fell as sales weakened for hardware and accessories, software and collectibles.\n\nThe results were released shortly after the man at the center of the pandemic meme stock craze, who is known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d on social media platforms YouTube and X, disclosed that he'll be hosting a YouTube livestream on Friday.\n\nGameStop Corp. lost $32.3 million, or 11 cents per share, for the period ended May 4. A year earlier, it lost $50.5 million, or 17 cents per share. Its adjusted loss was 12 cents per share.\n\nQuarterly sales dropped to $881.8 million from $1.24 billion a year ago.\n\nThe company, which was anticipated to release its quarterly results on Tuesday, said that it would not be holding a conference call on Friday to discuss its financial performance.\n\nGameStop also filed paperwork with securities regulators to sell up to 75 million shares of stock. In the filing GameStop noted that between Feb. 4 and June 6, the closing price of its stock has ranged between $10.01 and $48.75, and daily trading volume ranged from 1.7 million shares to nearly 207 million shares. \u201cDuring such period, we did not experience any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.\u201d Going back to January 2021, \u201cthe market price of our common stock has seen extreme price fluctuations that do not appear to be based on the underlying fundamentals of our business or results of operations.\u201d\n\nIn premarket trading, GameStop shares swung from a hefty gain to losses of about 7% at $43.10 after the earnings report.\n\nGameStop's disclosures of its first-quarter financials and stock sale come after Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d announced that he'd be hosting a YouTube livestream at noon ET on Friday. Investors that follow the company's stock will be looking to see if Gill talks about his position in GameStop's shares, as earlier this week there was speculation that he may own a large number of shares of the video game retailer that may be worth millions.\n\nGill also goes by the name Deep F- - - - - - Value on Reddit. Late Sunday, the Reddit account shared a screenshot in the r/SuperStonk forum that people are speculating could be an image of the shares and call options Gill holds in GameStop. The image showed that Gill may hold 5 million shares of GameStop that were worth $115.7 million as of the closing price on Friday. The screenshot also showed 120,000 call options in GameStop with a $20 strike price that expires on June 21. The call options were bought at around $5.68 a piece.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Gill\u2019s account on X posted a picture of a reverse card from the popular game Uno on Sunday night. There was no text accompanying the image.\n\nThat activity came about three weeks after Gill appeared online for the first time in three years, spiking the price of GameStop at the time. In May, the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d account posted an image on X of a man sitting forward in his chair, a meme used by gamers when things are getting serious.\n\nThe post on X was followed with a YouTube video from years before when Gill championed the beleaguered company GameStop saying, \u201cThat\u2019s all for now cuz I\u2019m out of breath. FYI here\u2019s a quick 4min video I put together to summarize the $GME bull case.\u201d\n\nGameStop in 2021 was a video game retailer that was struggling to survive as consumers switched rapidly from discs to digital downloads. Big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock, believing that its shares would continue on a drastically downward trend.\n\nGill and those who agreed with him changed the trajectory of a company that appeared to be headed for bankruptcy by buying up thousands of GameStop shares in the face of almost any accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble.\n\nThat began what is known as a \u201cshort squeeze,\u201d when those big investors that had bet against GameStop were forced to buy its rapidly rising stock to offset their massive losses.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop (GME) Reports Q1 Loss, Misses Revenue Estimates",
        "content": "GameStop (GME) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.12 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.10. This compares to loss of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -20%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this video game retailer would post earnings of $0.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.22, delivering a surprise of -12%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nGameStop , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Consumer Electronics industry, posted revenues of $881.8 million for the quarter ended April 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.02%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.24 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nGameStop shares have added about 165.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 12.2%.\n\nWhat's Next for GameStop?\n\nWhile GameStop has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for GameStop: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.05 on $1 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.01 on $4.5 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Consumer Electronics is currently in the bottom 7% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nTorrid Holdings (CURV), another stock in the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on June 12.\n\nThis women's apparel retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -36.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nTorrid Holdings' revenues are expected to be $280.21 million, down 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Keith Gill\u2019s highly anticipated return to YouTube could take GameStop Corp. speculators on a wild ride Friday as the man who has helped drive recent multi-billion dollar swings in the stock price commands investors\u2019 attention.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBehind \u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 the Year\u2019s Biggest Video-Game Flop Real Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans Vietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media Billionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day A Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions\n\nShares of the video-game retailer rose as much as 37% in early premarket trading on the day of Gill\u2019s first livestream in more than three years. Overall, the stock has soared 167% since Gill returned to X with a cryptic meme on May 12, adding $11 billion to GameStop\u2019s market value over that stretch.\n\nThe surge has bolstered Gill\u2019s apparent position in the company to more than $500 million, when accounting for common stock and call options, according to a Reddit post on June 6. Now, the video could serve as yet another catalyst for the meme stock darling, as more than 12,000 YouTube users have asked to be notified when the stream starts at noon in New York.\n\n\u201cI have no choice, do I?\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, when asked if he\u2019ll be watching. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mystery here, and until it\u2019s like Scooby-Doo where they take the mask off the guy, we don\u2019t know really what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nCryptic posts from Gill\u2019s Roaring Kitty X account combined with portfolio checks on his DeepF\u2014-ingValue handle on Reddit, sent investors piling into GameStop shares over the past four weeks. The stock\u2019s surge over that stretch comes despite the video-game retailer selling nearly $1 billion in equity and providing preliminary sales numbers that showed declining revenue.\n\nBullish Speculation\n\nGill\u2019s return to YouTube sparked further speculation that he\u2019s bullish on GameStop, even though his post contained no information on what he plans to discuss or whether he\u2019ll disclose new positions. However, the YouTube post did include a disclaimer warning that the video would be opinion-based, along with familiar equity legalese saying past performance is not indicative of future results \u2014 something that hadn\u2019t appeared in prior posts from the account.\n\n\u201cThis YouTube channel is not under any obligation to update or correct any information provided in these videos,\u201d the disclaimer read in part. \u201cStatements and opinions are subject to change without notice. No compensation is received by this YouTube channel for the opinions expressed.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead of investors buying shares of the company on fundamentals, Gill\u2019s influence has been enough to set chatrooms and social media platforms on fire with chatter around the stock.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the shaman for this group,\u201d Sosnick said. \u201cAnd if he is really involved and orchestrating this thing then that\u2019s what his followers would want it to be.\u201d\n\nGameStop\u2019s stock price \u201cis completely divorced from its business,\u201d said Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, who added that she won\u2019t be among the thousands watching the \u201cspectacle\u201d of Gill\u2019s return.\n\nInvesting in meme stocks became a frenzy in 2021 as cash-rich retail investors cooped up during the height of the pandemic bet against short-selling hedge funds, sending equity markets soaring. The mania delivered huge losses to the likes of Gabe Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital Management, which was forced to shutter, and rich returns to those who placed bets early in the frenzy before stocks like GameStop came crashing down.\n\nThe latest rally in GameStop shares has also burned skeptical investors. Thursday\u2019s gain alone dealt short sellers nearly $1 billion in mark-to-market losses, according to data analytics firm S3 Partners. Those bearish investors are now down almost $1.4 billion this month, the firm\u2019s data show, despite shorts buying 2.2 million shares to cover the bearish bets over the past 30 days.\n\nBig Position\n\nEarlier this week, Gill shared a screenshot on Reddit that appeared to show him owning $116 million of GameStop shares. A position that large would make Gill one of the company\u2019s five biggest investors. It\u2019s also more than six times the number of shares his account showed in an April 2021 post, the last time it was active on Reddit, when accounting for a four-for-one stock split.\n\nGill profited handsomely from investing in the beleaguered video-game retailer through 2020 and 2021. His recent social media activity, beginning with a cryptic X post on May 12 of an image of a video gamer leaning in, fueled anticipation that he was returning to the market, driving the share price to more than triple in a matter of days.\n\nThis week, a Reddit post showing the massive stake paired with another X post sent shares higher, as Gill showed an image of a reverse card from the game UNO that allows a player to flip the direction of play.\n\nThe posts and the market\u2019s reaction to them have sparked conversations over whether Gill\u2019s social media actions could amount to market manipulation. Online brokerage E*Trade was considering banning Gill from its platform, in part due to his influence over the stock, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week.\n\n\u201cWhat the government would need to show to pursue a market manipulation theory is manipulative intent,\u201d said Pillsbury partner David Oliwenstein, a member of the firm\u2019s Corporate Investigations & White Collar Defense team and former senior counsel in the SEC\u2019s Market Abuse Unit.\n\nGill\u2019s apparent promotion on X using videos and memes that are seemingly unrelated to the company put his behavior in \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d Oliwenstein said. But \u201cthe elements of a market manipulation claim remain unchanged. It\u2019s a matter of taking the current fact pattern to prove manipulative intent,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to assume that the SEC will at least take a hard look at the trading,\u201d Oliwenstein said.\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

The net sales total missed a consensus estimate of $995.30 million.\n\nThe company reported an EPS loss of $(0.12), missing the estimate of $(0.09).\n\nThe performance reflects customer\u2019s transition to video games and collectibles online, while the retailer depended on brick-and-mortar stores, Reuters reports.\n\nThe gross margin improved by 450 bps to 27.7%. The quarter\u2019s net loss was $(32.3) million, down from $(50.5) million last year.\n\nThe company held $1.08 billion in cash and equivalents as of May 4, 2024.\n\nThe stock had already got a boost from the return of Keith Gill,\u00a0also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d to social media following three years of hush. Gill is known for spearheading the meme stock movement.\n\nGameStop will be the subject of a YouTube livestream by meme trader Gill later Friday, CNBC reports.\n\nGameStop also filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC regarding its \u201cat-the-market offering\u201d program, which allows the sale of up to 75 million shares.\n\nBefore this filing, GameStop sold 45 million shares on May 17, 2024, generating about $933.4 million in gross proceeds.\n\nThe company said it intends to use the net proceeds from the new offering for general corporate purposes, including mergers and acquisition activity.\n\nGameStop\u00a0stock gained over 78% in the last 12 months.

(SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nGameStop (GME)\n\nGameStop stock is on a tear again in premarket trade, with futures up 34% having risen 47.5% on Thursday, as memestock influencer dubbed 'Roaring Kitty' scheduled his return to YouTube.\n\nSocial media posts by Keith Gill spurred on the rally as the \"Roaring Kitty\" channel on YouTube showed a livestream scheduled for 12pm ET on Friday.\n\nGameStop's stock price has headed as high as $64.83 a share in previous weeks as Gill returned to X. At Thursday's close the price stood at $46.55, with futures contracts currently pointing to an open near $62 per share.\n\nThe last time GameStop reached those heights was November 2021 as Reddit fuelled speculation by retail investors.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock looks set for a calmer day of trade, after losing 1.2% of value on Thursday, ahead of its planned 10-for-one stock split.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe pullback came after the chip giant hit the coveted $3 trillion mark. Wednesday's move pushed the chip giant past Apple, making it the second-most-valuable company on the US stock market before the early retreat. Microsoft (MSFT) currently holds the top spot.\n\nThe rally came amid a broader gain in tech stocks, with softer US economic data and a decline in Treasury yields boosting markets on hopes the Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as July.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for investor enthusiasm in artificial intelligence, which accelerated with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nThe stock is up over 140% this year and 200% over the last year; Nvidia shares have gained more than 3,300% in the last five years. Over those same periods, the Nasdaq has gained a more modest 14%, 29%, and 126%, respectively.\n\nRead more: UK house prices stall amid high mortgages\n\nFresnillo (FRES.L)\n\nMiner Fresnillo was among the top fallers in the FTSE 100 on Friday, dipping around 2.3% after a rally into Thursday.\n\nThe declines track that of bellwether commodity copper (HG=F), which dipped below $10,000 per metric ton amid growing global inventories and sluggish US job openings data.\n\nStory continues\n\nCopper prices had been on the up since February.\n\nBellway (BWY.L)\n\nUK housebuilder Bellway increased the average house sale price forecast on Friday, as better customer affordability improved its outlook.\n\nIts stock rose 0.9% in London on the report, despite data from Halifax which suggests house prices are cooling due to high mortgage rates.\n\n\"Bellway has delivered a solid trading performance supported by improved affordability and a seasonal uplift through the spring,\" CEO Jason Honeyman said.\n\nWatch: GameStop surges. shorting Nvidia: Market Domination<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI\\\">^DJI</a>,<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC\\\">^GSPC</a>,<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC\\\"> ^IXIC</a>) little changed ahead of the May jobs report.</p>\\n<p>One of the biggest movers of the day was GameStop (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME\\\">GME</a>).

Find out in our full research report.\n\nGameStop (GME) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $881.8 million vs analyst estimates of $995.3 million (11.4% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): -$0.12 vs analyst expectations of -$0.09 (33.3% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 27.7%, up from 23.2% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$114.7 million compared to -$111.8 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $16.35 billion\n\nDrawing gaming fans with demo units set up with the latest releases, GameStop (NYSE:GME) sells new and used video games, consoles, and accessories, as well as pop culture merchandise.\n\nElectronics & Gaming Retailer\n\nAfter a long day, some of us want to just watch TV, play video games, listen to music, or scroll through our phones; electronics and gaming retailers sell the technology that makes this possible, plus more. Shoppers can find everything from surround-sound speakers to gaming controllers to home appliances in their stores. Competitive prices and helpful store associates that can talk through topics like the latest technology in gaming and installation keep customers coming back. This is a category that has moved rapidly online over the last few decades, so these electronics and gaming retailers have needed to be nimble and aggressive with their e-commerce and omnichannel investments.\n\nSales Growth\n\nGameStop is a mid-sized retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better economies of scale. On the other hand, it has an edge over smaller competitors with fewer resources and can still flex high growth rates because it's growing off a smaller base than its larger counterparts.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's revenue has declined over the last four years, dropping 9.4% annually as its store count and sales at existing, established stores have both shrunk. GameStop Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, GameStop missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 28.7% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $881.8 million in revenue. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to decline 3.7% over the next 12 months.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nStory continues\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is an important metric that tracks demand for a retailer's established brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce platform.\n\nGameStop's demand has been shrinking over the last eight quarters, and on average, its same-store sales have declined by 5.1% year on year. The company has been reducing its store count as fewer locations sometimes lead to higher same-store sales, but that hasn't been the case here. GameStop Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nKey Takeaways from GameStop's Q1 Results\n\nThis was an interesting quarter for GameStop. It was initially slated to report earnings on June 11 but pre-announced the results, likely in an attempt to capitalize on the hype generated by Reddit star Roaring Kitty's return. It certainly worked, and the stock is up huge in pre-market trading.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, however, this was a bad quarter for GameStop. Its revenue and EPS missed analysts' expectations, and it didn't share an outlook for the rest of the year. It also announced a stock sale plan to take advantage of the run-up in its shares, a potentially dilutive event for shareholders.\n\nInvestors unsurprisingly didn't seem to care, and the stock is up 22.8% after reporting. It currently trades at $57.16 per share, and Roaring Kitty's position is likely now in the upper hundreds of millions of dollars. His call options on the company are rumored to expire on June 21, which will be a big catalyst for its share price.\n\nSo should you invest in GameStop right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

        "title": "Nonfarm payrolls, Nvidia, GameStop - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The monthly payrolls report is the highlight of the day's activity, as investors look for more clues as to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Nvidia remains in the spotlight, although short positions in the AI giant are rising, while volatility in meme stock GameStop is set to continue. .\n\n1. Nonfarm payrolls in spotlight\n\nThe day\u2019s highlight will be the closely watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues on the timing of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nExpectations are for the world's largest economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month - slightly more than April's 175,000, which was the smallest gain in half a year. The unemployment rate is expected to have remained below 4% for the 28th straight month.\n\nThat said, a slew of economic data this week have pointed to an easing of labor market conditions, creating the possibility of a downside surprise.\n\nInvestors had been worried that an overly strong economy might prevent the U.S. Federal Reserve from lowering rates this year at all. But those concerns have been, at least partly, alleviated by data showing slowing inflation as well as a cooling labor market.\n\nThe employment report could prove the economy is losing steam if it shows the slowdown in job creation has continued, but an upside surprise could deliver a nasty shock to markets.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee meets next week, but is not expected to cut interest rates at that point. Markets currently price in 50 basis points of cuts by end-December, with the first cut most likely coming in September.\n\n2. Futures just higher ahead of jobs report\n\nU.S. stock futures traded marginally higher Friday, with investors wary of taking hefty positions ahead of the release of the key monthly jobs report.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 35 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 3 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 23 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices are all on course for a winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stands 0.5% higher, the S&P 500 is gaining 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a 2.6% advance.\n\nThe main focus will be the nonfarm payrolls report [see above], as investors look for further evidence of a slowing economy that may support interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets next week to discuss monetary policy, and this report comes a day after the European Central Bank cut rates for the first time since 2019.\n\n3. Short positions on Nvidia soar\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI, with its stock more than trebling over the last year, culminating in its market capitalization surging past $3 trillion on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for its AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nHowever, there has also been a sharp rise in short positions on Nvidia\u2019s stock as it overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-most valuable company on Wall Street.\n\nData from S3 Partners showed the notional value of short positions on Nvidia rose to $34.4 billion this week, representing about 1% of the firm\u2019s overall market capitalization.\n\nNvidia is the \u201clargest short in the U.S. market,\u201d S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n4. GameStop volatility to continue\n\nThe volatility in GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading is set to continue Friday, after the online stock influencer known as \"Roaring Kitty\" posted on YouTube that he would host a livestream later in the session.\n\nThe struggling videogame retailer surged 20% on Monday after the influencer\u2019s - Keith Gill is his real name - Reddit profile returned with a post showing a $116 million bet on the stock after a three-year gap.\n\nGill was a key player in the 2021 rally of so-called meme stocks, including GameStop, that was fueled by individual investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets forum.\n\nGameStop stock surged nearly 50% on Thursday, and gained a further 30% in after hours trading.\n\n5. Crude set for hefty weekly losses\n\nCrude prices traded largely flat Friday, and are on course for a third straight week of declines on concerns over rising supply.\n\nBy 03:55 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded largely unchanged at $75.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $79.84 per barrel.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman tried on Thursday to address concerns that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, could lift output levels later this year.\n\nHe said the group can pause or reverse voluntary output increases if it decides the market is not strong enough.\n\nHowever, the crude benchmarks are still on track for weekly losses of around 2% in the wake of last weekend\u2019s OPEC+ meeting.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNonfarm payrolls, Nvidia, GameStop - what's moving markets\n\nStock market rally pauses as US jobs data looms\n\nTake Five: Which way to look first?\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Thursday, tracking a muted session on Wall Street as investors hunkered down before key payrolls data that is likely to factor into interest rates.\n\nMeme stock GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) was an exception, extending strong gains into aftermarket trade after influencer Keith Gill said he will hold a livestream on Friday.\n\nStill, Wall Street indexes remained close to record highs this week as soft economic readings in the lead-up to Friday all pushed up bets that the Federal Reserve will have more confidence to begin cutting interest rates soon.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,364.0 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 19,076.25 points by 19:06 ET (23:06 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 38,970.0 points.\n\nNonfarm payrolls to cap off week of weak data\n\nNonfarm payrolls data for May is due on Friday, and is expected to show payrolls increased slightly in the month, reflecting sustained strength in the labor market.\n\nBut a string of other readings this week suggested that the labor market was cooling. Job openings fell, while ADP employment data also read lower than expected.\n\nBeyond inflation, the labor market is also a key consideration for the Fed in cutting interest rates.\n\nInvestors were seen rapidly ramping up bets that the Fed will begin trimming interest rates in September, following the weak data.\n\nThe Fed is set to meet next week, and is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. But anticipation of the meeting is also expected to factor into market caution.\n\nWall St near record highs, heads for weekly gains\n\nWall Street indexes saw a middling close on Thursday amid some profit-taking in market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and as investors awaited more definitive cues on interest rates.\n\nThe S&P 500 steadied at 5,352.96 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.1% to 17,170.64 points. Both indexes were up 1.4% and 2.6% for the week, respectively, after hitting record highs on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to finish at 38,886.17 points on Friday, but lagged its peers this week with a 0.5% gain. It also remained well below record highs hit earlier in May.\n\nAftermarket movers: Gamestop extends gains, Docusign falls\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, meme stock Gamestop surged about 26% after rallying over 47% during the session. Influencer Keith Gill, or \u201cRoaringKitty,\u201d who had helped spark the memestock mania of 2021, said he will host a livestream on Youtube this Friday- his first in almost four years.\n\nGill had last sunday revealed he held about 5 million shares and 120,000 call options in the videogame retailer- a position worth at least $200 million now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoftware firm DocuSign Inc (NASDAQ:DOCU) fell 6% after its second quarter guidance disappointed, even as it beat expectations with its first quarter earnings.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady with nonfarm payrolls in focus, Gamestop surges\n\nNovo Nordisk braces for generic challenge to Ozempic, Wegovy in China\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq close slightly down ahead of US payrolls data\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Maybe I Will' Roaring Kitty's Last Comment On Reddit 3 Years Ago Foreshadowed 2024\n\nKeith Gill, popularly known as Roaring Kitty, has amassed a substantial position in GameStop Corp. After over three years, on June 2, 2024, he posted a snapshot of his portfolio on Reddit\u2019s r/superstonk message board. The snapshot revealed significant holdings in GameStop \u2014 5 million shares, 120,000 call options and $29 million cash.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where things become interesting. If Gill exercises his 120,000 GameStop $20 call options, his stake will increase from 5 million to 17 million shares, substantially boosting his investment in the company.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cubanand opens a round for regular investors at $250. Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.\n\nGME shares spiked from $17.46 on May 10th to $55.69 on May 14th before retracing those gains. At Monday's (June 3rd) closing price of $28, the stake would be worth $476 million, per CNBC. But at the most recent peak of $64.83 on May 14, it would be worth more than double that \u2014 $1.1 billion.\n\nKeith Gill\u2019s Last Reddit Comment\n\nKeith Gill, known for his significant role in sparking r/WallStreetBets\u2019 interest in GameStop just before its legendary short squeeze in late 2020 and early 2021, undeniably reaped substantial financial gains from his investments.\n\nTrending: A groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\n\nHis last comment on Reddit was on January 5, 2021, when he cryptically replied, \u201cMaybe I will\u201d to a user's suggestion that he invest his $1.1 million in additional GameStop shares. In hindsight, this seemingly casual response now appears prescient, hinting at his strategic thinking and potential commitment to further GameStop investment.\n\nFast-forward to 2024, and Gill's recent activities mirror his bold investment approach. Breaking his silence after a prolonged period, he returned to social media, posting a significant update on his portfolio. This substantial commitment to GameStop suggests that Gill followed through on his hinted intention to double down on the stock.\n\nGill\u2019s return and portfolio update have intensified speculation about his investment tactics. Investors and the broader financial community closely watch his potential next steps, including whether he will hold, sell, or invest in GameStop.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Carvana, Nvidia, GameStop and Netflix",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 6, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Carvana CVNA, Nvidia NVDA, GameStop GME and Netflix NFLX.\n\n10 Principles to Fast-Track Profitable Investing\n\nIn today's piece, I am going to break down ten market lessons that I wish I learned earlier. Market participants who thoroughly understand these principles will be on the fast track to profitability. Let's jump straight into it:\n\n1. Markets Discount the Future\n\nWall Street and financial markets are master manipulators because they often bottom on poor news and vice versa. For example, Bitcoin bottomed within days of the FTX crypto exchange collapse, and hasn't looked back since.\n\nFor equity markets, the psychology is the same. The S&P 500and the other major indices bottomed the day inflation hit 40-year highs in the U.S in late 2022.\n\n2. Fundamentals Mean Little in a Vacuum\n\nTo successfully analyze fundamentals, investors must account for the context of said fundamentals. The struggling e-commerce firm Carvana has soared more than 500% over the past year and provides a perfect fundamental lesson for investors. Why has the stock run so much? In late 2022, Carvana was on the brink of collapse. However, the company secured funding to keep the company in business. Later, it turned its earnings from awful to less bad.\n\n3. Valuations are Not a Timing Device\n\nAn important lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are not a valid timing tool \u2013 especially for innovative growth stocks. While the numerator (price) is known, the denominator (sales) is not known (moving forward). Because of this misconception, Zacks Investment Research heavily weights its analysis and ratings based on forward EPS expectations. Amateur investors would probably be surprised to find that Nvidia's P/S ratio has actually fallen since mid-2023 despite the massive bull move in the stock.\n\n4. Strive to Trade Like a Casino (Edge)\n\nLike life, nothing on Wall Street or investing is ever obvious or certain, which is why most active retail investors lose money or underperform. Fortunately, perfection or a very high trade success rate is not necessary to achieve investment success. Think of a casino. Casinos don't make money on every hand. However, casinos enjoy an edge that, when played out over a large series of hands, pays the bills (and then some). Similarly, investors pay \"tuition\" to the stock market through stop losses and risk management.\n\nAmateur investors suffer from inconsistent returns because they tend to rely on gut feel and make emotional trades. Conversely, savvy investors leverage historical precedent, data sets, fundamentals and charts to gain an edge.\n\nStory continues\n\n5. Take Asymmetric Bets\n\nAmateur investors apply more emphasis to stock picking when they should focus more time and energy on sound money management principles. Fortunately, the math is simple to understand. If an investor risks $1 to make $5 on each trade, they can be wrong 80% of the time and still break even. Using these same numbers, an investor who achieves a 40% hit rate with this reward-to-risk ratio will be highly profitable over a large enough series of trades. Don't overthink investing; let the math work in your favor.\n\n6. Fundamentals Are But One Piece of the Puzzle\n\nThough fundamentals are integral to a stock's long-run performance, other factors, such as changes in share supply, play a role in direction. For example, \"animal spirits\" and hype have largely driven GameStop's super performance over the past few years, whereas earnings for more profitably sound companies have largely stagnated recently, record share buybacks have decreased supply and increased demand, driving the stock higher.\n\n7. U.S. Markets Rise in Time\n\nDespite war, recession, and countless \"Black Swan\" events, U.S. equities tend to rise in the long run due to America's innovative nature. The S&P 500 Index has averaged returns ~100% over the past century. While the market suffers corrections in the short term, understanding the long-term picture pays long-term dividends.\n\n8. Innovation Breeds True Market Leaders\n\nThe best-performing growth stocks are driven by growing earnings, which are sparked by innovation and disruption. For example, Blockbuster was once far larger than Netflix. However, Blockbuster failed to recognize that technology was changing and the brick-and-mortar approach to movies would no longer be relevant. Conversely, NFLX pounced on the emerging DVD-by-mail trend, and later, the streaming trend, leading to a life-changing move for its investors.\n\n9. Forward EPS Estimates & The Zacks Rank\n\nInvestors can screen a large database of stocks by sorting by the Zacks Rank. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks signify that Wall Street analysts are becoming increasingly bullish on a company's fundamentals ahead. Our extensive in-house studies show that Zacks Rank #1 stocks tend to outperform dramatically, all else equal.\n\n10. Market Direction is King\n\nApproximately 75% of a stock's move can be attributed to the general market's direction. The most straightforward way to size up the long-term trend is to plot the 200-day moving average over the major indices like the Nasdaq 100 ETF.\n\nWhen price is above the 200-day moving average, the market is in a bull phase, and vice versa. Never fight the trend.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInstead of \"trial by fire,\" investors can circumvent years of frustration by understanding ten essential principles.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Five Below (FIVE) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -3.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of $3.78 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.65, delivering a surprise of -3.44%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nFive Below , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $811.86 million for the quarter ended April 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.36%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $726.25 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nFive Below shares have lost about 35.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Five Below?\n\nWhile Five Below has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Five Below: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.01 on $884.25 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.01 on $4.03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAnother stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, GameStop (GME), has yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024. The results are expected to be released on June 11.\n\nThis video game retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 16.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nGameStop's revenues are expected to be $900 million, down 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Citron Research founder Andrew Left is shorting GameStop again, arguing the stock is \u201cextremely overvalued\u201d after its latest meteoric rise. The veteran short seller was burned on his first bet against meme-stock traders\u2019 favorite company in 2021, eventually closing out his short position at a 100% loss and halting the publication of short reports after he said an \u201cangry mob\u201d of fanatical GameStop shareholders harassed him.\n\nBut Left, who made his name with big bets against the pharmaceutical giant Valeant and China\u2019s now-defunct property giant Evergrande, told the Wall Street Journal that he made a profit when he bet against GameStop again last month.\n\nThe video game retailer saw its shares surge from just over $10 at the start of May to an intraday peak of $64.83 by May 14 after Keith Gill\u2014the trader, and de facto meme-stock leader, who goes by Roaring Kitty\u2014referenced the company in social media posts, leading retail investors to pile in. After that initial surge, GameStop stock eventually fell to a low of $18.93 on May 23, and Left says he was able to close out his short position for a profit during this period, he says.\n\nOn Monday, the Citron Research founder doubled down on his bearish bet against GameStop after Gill posted a screenshot on Reddit that implied he owns over $100 million of the retailer\u2019s stock. \u201cWhen I saw it, I shorted it,\u201d Left told Bloomberg of the Reddit post.\n\nThe surge in GameStop shares simply \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and shows the U.S. has become a \u201cnation of gamblers,\u201d he said in his Wall Street Journal interview.\n\nGameStop stock has risen more than 33% from its opening price on Monday, but fallen over 23% from that day\u2019s intraday high. That means the potential profitability of Left\u2019s current short position, at least at the moment, depends on the price at which he was able to secure shares for the bet.\n\nEither way, the veteran short-seller said that he did learn not to make large bets against \u201ccult\u201d stocks when he was burned shorting GameStop back in 2021, and his latest short compromises a small portion of his portfolio. \u201cIt\u2019s a cult stock. You don\u2019t do that on cult stocks,\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Sorry Video Game Stocks to Sell Now While You Still Can: Summer Edition",
        "content": "The video gaming industry, while robust, is facing some serious challenges. The slowdown in consumer spending, market saturation, and uninspiring video game titles have dampened the industry\u2019s position. Moreover, though it\u2019s one of the fastest-growing segments in entertainment, video gaming isn\u2019t immune to market saturation and fierce competition. Hence, it\u2019s probably time to think about the right video game stocks to sell.\n\nRecent data shows a concerning trend, with U.S. video game sales dipping 3% year-over-year (YOY) in April, totaling $4.1 billion. This decline was led by a 43% drop in hardware sales, which fell to $208 million. Meanwhile, video game content sales were up just a modest 2% to $3.74 billion. The gaming hardware sector overall has plummeted at least 26% on a YOY basis. With these concerning stats, here are three video game stocks to offload now.\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) investors are reeling following upwards of a $6.4 billion loss in market cap since the peak of the latest meme stock rally. Fueled by the re-emergence of the social media influencer, \u2018Roaring Kitty, \u2018 GME stock witnessed a sharp rise in value along with other meme stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, the temporary buzz around GME stock has done little to mask the underlying problems of its business. Online gaming sales have risen at a breathtaking pace, outpacing growth in physical sales. Though GameStop has looked to reinvent its business in line with industry trends, its efforts so far haven\u2019t borne much fruit.\n\nAs a result, revenue change is firmly in the negative at -11%, behind its 5-year average loss of -7%.\u00a0 Hence, the outlook remains remarkably bleak, with social media hype as its only lifeline. Therefore, serious investors should avoid GME stock at all costs to lower their downside risk.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) EA games logo on a black brick background. EA stock.\n\nSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock\n\nElectronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) is a popular video game publisher known for its array of classic titles, which have garnered a massive following. Despite operating a consistent business over the years, it is now in unfamiliar territory. The transition from legacy titles to new endeavors poses serious questions about its future growth trajectory.\n\nThough its popular franchises, such as EA Sports FC (formerly FIFA) and Apex Legends, remain profitable, their aging appeal presses the need for fresh intellectual properties. The shift to EA Sports FC, in particular, poses long-term uncertainties, especially once FIFA aligns with a new partner.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the meantime, EA\u2019s investors are facing the brunt of the company\u2019s testing transition phase. Its fourth-quarter report showed sales of $1.67 billion, down roughly 14.4% YOY, while messing estimates by a whopping $104.9 million. In addition, a lackluster fiscal 2025 forecast and broader market challenges are causing this stock to be poised to diminish shareholder value in the foreseeable future.\n\nCorsair Gaming (CRSR) A photo of the Corsair (CRSR) logo on the front of a building in California.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nCorsair Gaming (NASDAQ:CRSR) is a commanding player in the gaming and streaming component industry. With a dominant position in its niche, it operates a relatively consistent business, posting healthy top-line growth. However, the recent market headwinds have led to a marked slowdown in its operational results.\n\nIts recently released Q1 results showed a 4.7% dip in revenues to $337.3 million on a YOY basis while missing estimates by $25.5 million. This represents another quarter where it handily missed estimates on both lines. Moreover, it posted an earnings-per-share of nine cents in Q1, missing estimates by five cents.\n\nLooking ahead, Corsair\u2019s outlook for the rest of the year is that it will bank heavily on the success of its peripheral sales and upcoming product launches.

        "title": "Factbox-How the SEC has bolstered the US market since the 2021 GameStop frenzy",
        "content": "By Michelle Price\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest resurgence of retail trading in GameStop follows major changes aimed at boosting the resilience and transparency of the market following the 2021 \"meme stock\" saga.\n\nGameStop shares surged on Monday after the stocks influencer \"Roaring Kitty\" returned to Reddit with a post showing a $116 million bet on the embattled videogame retailer.\n\nIt was the first post from the account since 2021 when a meteoric rally in GameStop and other \"meme stocks\" partly stoked by \"Roaring Kitty\" caused intense volatility, prompting brokers to restrict trading in some shares and causing massive losses for hedge funds that had bet against them.\n\nSince then, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted or proposed broad changes to fix structural problems highlighted by that extraordinary episode. Here are the key ones:\n\nT+1 SETTLEMENT\n\nThe 2021 meme stock volatility prompted the post-trade clearing house to call on retail brokerages including Robinhood to post billions of dollars in extra collateral to guarantee their retail clients' trades. In response, several brokers restricted trading in the affected stocks.\n\nRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the time that the problem was largely due the two days it takes trades to settle, and if settlements were in real time so much collateral would not be necessary.\n\nPartly in response to that episode, the SEC has moved U.S. equities, corporate and municipal bonds and other securities, to a one business day settlement cycle, known as T+1 settlement.\n\nThat market overhaul went into effect last week.\n\nSHORT SELLING, HEDGE FUND DISCLOSURES\n\nMost of the stocks in the 2021 meme saga were heavily shorted by hedge funds - a strategy used to bet a stock price will fall. While the SEC said in its October 2021 post-mortem that the available data did not suggest foul play when it came to such short sales, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said greater transparency of short selling may be warranted.\n\nThe SEC has since adopted new rules to boost hedge fund disclosures around their investment exposures, counterparty exposure and other risks, as well as short selling positions.\n\nSome of its changes are being challenged by the industry in court.\n\nMARKET STRUCTURE\n\n2021 shone a spotlight on what Gensler has said are problems in the retail trading market. Rather than sending customer orders to exchanges, most retail brokers send them to wholesale market makers in return for a fee, a practice known as payment for order flow.\n\nCritics say the practice creates conflicts of interest by incentivizing brokers to encourage customers to trade more frequently. Studies show retail investors generally lose money when they churn their portfolio. The small number of market makers also limits competition, critics argue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, the SEC proposed sweeping changes that aim to address these issues, in part by creating more incentives to send retail orders to exchanges. The agency expects to finalize that rule sometime this year, according to its public agenda.\n\nDIGITAL TRADING PROMPTS\n\nGensler has criticized the \"gamification of trading\" in which brokerages encourage excessive trading using lights, noises, notifications and other gimmicks to generate more payment for order flow.\n\nHe has also highlighted the use of artificial intelligence, predictive data analytics and machine learning to push products.\n\nLast year, the SEC proposed rules requiring broker-dealers to \"eliminate or neutralize\" any conflict of interest that occurs if a trading platform's predictive data analytics puts the broker's financial interest ahead of clients'.\n\nThat rule has run into intense opposition and Gensler last month told reporters he was considering re-proposing it.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Price; additional reporting by Douglas Gillison; Editing by Marguerita Choy)\n\nView comments",

Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the screenshots and the posters did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"If they're gonna ban the kitty, all of retail should leave their platform,\" proclaimed Reddit user FalseDifficulty2340.\n\nPosters also suggested the firm's rivals likely would welcome Gill as a client if E*Trade removed Gill from its platform.\n\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; editing by Megan Davies and Josie Kao)",

The market dynamics have changed and I'm not as exposed as I was,\" Left told Reuters on his current position in GameStop.\n\n\"The first time, three-and-a-half-years ago, (GameStop) was a cultural phenomenon, and that's played out by now. The company has deteriorating financials and is a good short.\"\n\nLeft did not disclose the size of his GameStop position but said it was \"significantly lower\" from last time. Bloomberg News on Monday reported Left's latest short position on the videogame retailer.\n\nGameStop did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.\n\nAfter getting squeezed by the GameStop surge in 2021, Left \u2014 who spent two decades building his brand as one of the world's best-known short sellers \u2014 had said he would turn his back on publicly detailing companies' shortcomings.\n\nSince then, Citron has published reports that are critical of companies and those that outline why the stock is worth buying.\n\n\"I've still been shorting stocks, I just haven't been as vocal,\" Left said.\n\n\"Short selling is a dying business. Before you could find a piece of information on the internet that maybe nobody else had, but now retail investors have become good gumshoes.\"\n\nShort sellers borrow stock and sell it in the market hoping that they can buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference.\n\nGameStop shares dropped 5.9% on Tuesday, a day after a surge as Gill, a key figure in the 2021 meme stocks frenzy, revealed a bet on the company in a Reddit post.\n\n(Reporting by Pranav Kashyap and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n\nView comments",

Regulatory inquiries and probes do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing and frequently do not result in any enforcement action.\n\nGalvin had probed Gill's 2021 activities but closed that matter after bringing a settlement with Gill's former employer MassMutual for failing to properly supervise his activities, the spokesperson told Reuters last month.\n\nIn 2021, screenshots on Reddit of his bullish GameStop trades triggered a rush of demand for \"meme stocks\" - often companies with weak fundamentals that gained a cult-like following through social media hype among retail traders.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the meme stock craze of 2021, ultimately finding that marketplace systems worked well and failing to find evidence that short sellers were behind the frenzy as retail investors had alleged.\n\nThe WSJ also reported that the SEC is looking at options trading in GameStop.

        "title": "3 WallStreetBets Stock Picks With Actual Potential for Massive Gains",
        "content": "If you\u2019re curious about the legitimacy of WallStreetBets stock picks, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Three of the worst WallStreetBets stock picks you can own are GameStop (NYSE:GME)., Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). The three meme stocks had 14, 14, and three mentions over the past 24 hours preceding June 1.\n\nWhile the WSB community discusses many poor-quality stocks, it also discusses a number of great companies. For example, the number one WSB stock by mentions in the past day at the time of writing is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), with 244 mentions, almost 100 more than the second-place stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThat\u2019s an excellent business, and if you hold it for 3-5 years or more, you\u2019ll likely make money on the AI game-changer. However, the WSB investor community has discussed other good businesses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three other WallStreetBets with excellent potential for massive gains. To keep it interesting, I\u2019ll keep my suggestions outside the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWallStreetBets Stock Picks: Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) had the third-highest mentions over the past 24 hours, with 82, which was 57% less than the previous day.\n\nThe company is one of the world\u2019s leaders in digital payments. You would have to live in a cave not to know its name. During fiscal year 2023 (September year-end), Visa processed 213 billion payments and cash transactions under its brand.\n\nIn Q2 2024, it generated $8.8 billion in revenue, 10% higher year-over-year, and $5.1 billion in non-GAAP earnings, 17% higher than Q2 2023. It processed 72.08 billion transactions during the quarter, with debit accounting for 66% and credit for 34%.\n\nThe company continues to be shareholder-friendly, returning $3.8 billion in capital to shareholders in 2023 through dividends and share repurchases. Over the past decade, it\u2019s reduced its share count by nearly one-fifth. As Warren Buffett often says about share repurchases, your ownership position grows without investing a single new dollar in the company.\n\nOver the past three years, Visa has grown its revenue and net income on an annualized basis by 14.34% and 16.71%, respectively. Despite a corporate history that dates back 66 years, it\u2019s still growing by double digits.\n\nWhile Visa only generated an annualized total return of 6.90% over the past three years, its return over the past 15 years is nearly three times higher. It\u2019s due for better returns.\n\nInvesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQM) wasn\u2019t mentioned, but its stablemate, the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ), was. QQQ had the fourth-highest mentions over the past 24 hours at the time of writing, with 64, 33% less than the previous day.\n\nI said I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t recommend one of the Mag 7. I didn\u2019t say I couldn\u2019t pick an ETF that holds one or more of them. QQQM tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index, a collection of 100 of the largest non-financial companies trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nAlthough QQQ has existed since March 1999, QQQM was only launched in October 2020 to allow buy-and-hold investors to own the index at a lower cost \u2014 5 basis points cheaper at 0.15%- and with an ETF structure rather than a unit trust. This allows QQQM to reinvest dividends and lend its stock to short sellers.\n\nAll seven of the Mag 7 are in the ETF\u2019s top 10 holdings, which account for 49% of its $26 billion in net assets. The two stocks not part of the Mag 7 and in the top 10 are Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST), my third pick.\n\nThere is no question that QQQM is a tech-focused fund, with nearly 59% of the net assets allocated to this sector. The next two sectors with the highest weight are consumer discretionary (17.9%) and health care (6.29%).\n\nThe downside of QQQM is that it\u2019s not nearly as liquid. However, its 30-day average daily volume of 1.58 million is plenty should you need to sell some shares quickly.\n\nIf you want Mag 7 stocks without as much risk, QQQM is a good option. Kudos to WSB members for understanding this.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco had the 19th-highest number of mentions over the past 24 hours, with 10, which was 85% less than the previous day.\n\nThe late Charlie Munger thought the membership-based warehouse discount retailer was the greatest business. Sure, he served on the board for 26 years, from 1997 until his death last November, but he believed in its business model.\n\n\u201c\u2018I love everything about Costco,\u2019 Munger said during The Daily Journal\u2019s annual shareholder meeting back in February, \u2018I\u2019m a total addict, and I\u2019m never going to sell a share,\u2019\u201d Yahoo Finance reported shortly after Munger\u2019s death.\n\nHow often do you hear a corporate director in an S&P 500 company talk that way about the company whose board he sits on? Very few, but Munger always spoke his mind, so when he said something, if you were smart, you listened and followed his lead.\n\nI\u2019ve been a big believer for years. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered a miserable Costco employee. They\u2019re always smiling as they go about their work days, which isn\u2019t easy given how many customers they check out daily. You can\u2019t fake that enthusiasm. It\u2019s contagious.\n\nOf course, there is the business model, which strives for the lowest prices possible while making most of its profit from annual membership fees.\n\nFurther, in 2023 (September year-end), its revenue from membership fees was $4.58 billion, or 73% of its $6.29 billion in net income. In 2013, its revenue from membership fees was $2.29 billion, or 112% of its net income. That\u2019s a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% over the past decade.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to love?\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Futures lower, JOLTS ahead, GameStop surges - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures slip following a volatile session on Monday. Traders are looking ahead to the release of key job openings data, which could provide a fresh glimpse into the state of the U.S. labor market. GameStop (NYSE:GME) shares move higher in after-hours trading, suggesting an extension in a Monday rally in the videogame retailer that was fueled by the return of stock influencer Keith Gill to social media website Reddit.\n\n1. U.S. futures dip\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered below the flatline on Tuesday following choppy trading in the previous session.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 76 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 14 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 69 points or 0.4%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street posted a mixed close on Monday, in a session marked by a glitch in the New York Stock Exchange that led to heavy volatility in the shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), miner Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), and the halting of trading in at least 60 stocks. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.6%.\n\nTech stocks delivered a late rally, while shares in energy firms faltered. U.S. Treasury yields touched two-week lows after manufacturing data showed activity in the sector had slowed for the second consecutive month, pointing to possible weakening in wider economic growth.\n\nTraders also increased their bets that the Federal Reserve will choose to begin ratcheting down interest rates from more than two-decade highs in September, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool. In a note, analysts at ING said the manufacturing figures, along with separate numbers suggesting a decline in construction industry spending, \"[indicate] that monetary policy is restrictive and is acting as a brake on economic activity.\"\n\n2. U.S. job openings data ahead\n\nInvestors will have the chance to parse through new U.S. job openings data on Tuesday, as they attempt to piece together the picture of labor demand in the world's largest economy.\n\nEconomists expect the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey -- also known as the JOLTS report -- to have slipped to 8.37 million in April, down from a three-year low of 8.488 million in the preceding month.\n\nA decline could be a sign of easing labor market conditions in the U.S. -- a trend that may boost hopes for Fed rate reductions later this year. In theory, a cooldown in demand for workers could defuse some upward pressure on wages and, by extension, inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nFed policymakers are tipped to keep borrowing costs on hold at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at a meeting next week. Several officials have said in a recent days they would like to see more evidence price gains are reliably decelerating to their target level before rolling out potential rate cuts.\n\n3. GameStop shares surge\n\nShares in GameStop rose by more than 8% in extended hours trading, as stock influencer Keith Gill appeared to hold on to gains in his holdings of the videogame retailer following a sharp rally on Monday.\n\nGameStop, which was the focal point of a rally in so-called \"meme stocks\" in 2021, advanced by 21% on Monday. The jump came after Gill, who is known online as \"DeepF-------Value\" and \"Roaring Kitty\", posted a screenshot on social media site Reddit which showed he had made a $116 million bet on the videogame retailer.\n\nAfter the closing bell on Monday, Gill posted another screenshot indicating that he held on to his stake of 5 million GameStop shares, or roughly 1.8% of its publicly available stock, and 120,000 call options.\n\nSeveral media sources have said they have been unable to independently verify the validity of the screenshots. Meanwhile, E-Trade, the investment platform Gill uses, is holding internal talks over whether to ban him from the service due to concerns over market manipulation, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n4. Illumina to spin off Grail cancer testing unit\n\nShares in Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) edged slightly higher in after-hours trading following a decision by the gene sequencing firm to spin off its Grail cancer testing division.\n\nCalifornia-based Illumina said its board had approved a spin out of Grail. The move is expected to take place on June 24, with the unit being listed on the Nasdaq as \"GRAL.\"\n\n\"Today's announcement marks a milestone for Illumina and signals an important step forward for the company, since the divestiture of Grail is one of our 2024 priorities,\" Illumina Chief Executive Jacob Thaysen said in a statement.\n\nLast year, U.S. trade regulators ordered Illumina to divest Grail, arguing its $8 billion purchase of the business would dent competition in the market for possibly life-saving cancer testing.\n\nEuropean Commission antitrust authorities had also previously slapped a 432 million euro fine on Illumina for implementing the Grail merger without the bloc's permission.\n\n5. Oil extends declines\n\nCrude prices fell Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session, after a group of major producers signaled an increase in supply later this year.\n\nBy 03:29 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1.6% lower at $73.03 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 1.4% to $77.27 per barrel. Both contracts slid over 3% on Monday, and were at their lowest level since early-February.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, on Sunday agreed to extend most of their oil output cuts into 2025 but left room for voluntary cuts from eight members to be gradually unwound.\n\nSentiment was also hit by weak purchasing managers' index data from both the U.S. and China, the two biggest economies in the world.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures lower, JOLTS ahead, GameStop surges - what's moving markets\n\nExclusive-Vietnam expands massive bank rescue effort on deposit exodus, document shows\n\nExplainer-Key features of China's affordable housing policy\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop Shares Surge as Gill\u2019s Reddit Return Shows Huge Bet",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. shares surged after the Reddit account that drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 posted what appeared to be a $116 million position in the video-game retailer on Sunday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKey Engines of US Consumer Spending Are Losing Steam All at Once GameStop Shares Surge as Gill\u2019s Reddit Return Shows Huge Bet Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money Homebuyers Are Starting to Revolt Over Steep Prices Across US AMLO Protege Sheinbaum Becomes First Female President in Mexico\n\nThe June 2 screenshot posted by Keith Gill, who goes by a profane handle involving the phrase Deep Value on Reddit, showed a stake of 5 million shares with an average cost basis of $21.27 apiece. A position that large would make Gill one of the company\u2019s five biggest investors and is more than six times the number of shares his account showed in an April 2021 post, the last time it was active on Reddit, when accounting for a four-for-one stock split.\n\nThe screenshot, which also included 120,000 call options worth $65.7 million due to expire on June 21, couldn\u2019t be verified. The options would allow him to buy the stock at $20 a share, but would cost him some $240 million to exercise. A follow-up post showed his shares are now worth $140 million and the options carry a $120 million value.\n\nDoing so would add 12 million shares to Gill\u2019s position. That would make him the fourth-largest shareholder, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The combined 17 million shares would be worth $476 million based on where GameStop closed on Monday.\n\nRead more: Gill\u2019s Purported GameStop Options Would Net Him $170 Million\n\nThe post was the account\u2019s first in more than three years, mirroring a return for Gill\u2019s X account just last month. The reappearance of Gill\u2019s \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d handle on social-media platform X jumpstarted a 271% two-day surge that was quickly reversed as the mania failed to retain investor interest.\n\nOn Monday, GameStop shares jumped 21%, adding some $1.7 billion to its market capitalization, as 164 million shares changed hands.\n\nOn X, Gill also posted an image of a reverse card from the game UNO that indicates a player is changing the card-pickup direction. The post had attracted more than 10 million views in the 21 hours since its publication at about 8 p.m. Sunday New York time.\n\nNever miss an episode. Follow The Big Take daily podcast today.\n\n\u201cRecent renewed interest in meme stocks, coming as the main US indices struggle to make new highs, is a sign of excessive over-exuberance and is more likely a negative portent given the rising headwinds in the markets,\u201d said Robert Lea, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore Roaring Kitty\u2019s return to X, Gill had been silent across social media platforms including Reddit and YouTube for more than three years. The first X post on May 12 with an image of a video gamer leaning in, fueled anticipation he\u2019d make a swift return to the market and drove shares to more than triple in days.\n\nIn turn, GameStop capitalized on the stock\u2019s jump, selling 45 million shares to raise roughly $933 million in a move that many industry watchers perceived as prudent while diluting the very investors that piled into the stock.\n\nThe company could execute the same strategy after Monday\u2019s rally, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \u201cThe lemmings who believe in Roaring Kitty might buy more stock at these prices, but there is nothing fundamental to support a valuation at this level.\u201d\n\nRead this next: The Stock Market After GameStop (Again)\n\nOver the following week, Gill posted more than 100 times on X, mostly videos and GIFs that were unrelated to GameStop, in a move reminiscent of his activity in the lead up to the 2021 mania. In his initial foray as a meme-stock influencer, Gill rallied day-traders on Reddit in 2021 to buy the stock to push back on short sellers, arguing then that the company was poised to \u201creinvent\u201d itself as a premier gaming hub.\n\nThe strategy that Gill and the company\u2019s now-chief executive officer and largest investor Ryan Cohen had touted have mostly been unsuccessful. \u201cHere we are three years later and his strategy was a bust,\u201d Pachter said. \u201cThe company has seen further revenue declines, and the environment for its core business has deteriorated significantly.\u201d\n\nHis posts fueled a rise in GameStop shares of more than 2,000% in early 2021, bringing the meme-stock frenzy into the broader public consciousness. Gill\u2019s recent X return triggered another GameStop rally, with the stock hitting a nearly $65 intraday peak in mid-May, only to have shares then fall more than 50% through Friday\u2019s close.\n\nOn Monday, other stocks favored by retail traders also got a boost. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rose as much as 32%, while Beyond Meat Inc. and Reddit Inc. were also stronger.\n\nGameStop is down 77% from a 2021 intraday peak even after a surge on Monday. Fellow meme-stock darling and movie-theater chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings is down 99% from a high. The massive paper losses have driven many of the investors who embraced the \u201cHODL\u201d motto, short for \u201chold on for dear life,\u201d to bail on trading the stocks.\n\nIn an April 16, 2021 Reddit post \u2014 his last until recently \u2014 Gill posted a screenshot that showed he held 200,000 GameStop shares, worth about $30.9 million at the time. Since then, the value of his position has more than tripled, despite the ups and downs.\n\nGill\u2019s latest Reddit post appeared on the r/Superstonk subforum, which is \u201ca place for theoretical discussions about GameStop stock.\u201d Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets, which catapulted the meme stock frenzy to capture international attention, has been more heavily moderated since the 2021 craze.\n\n--With assistance from Farah Elbahrawy.\n\n(Updates share movement throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Israel Seeks Underground Secrets by Tracking Cosmic Particles How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cash Out Before They Crash Out: 7 Stocks About to Drop Quickly",
        "content": "Stocks decline for any number of reasons. It\u2019s impossible to predict those declines all the time but relatively easy most of the time. Avoid investing in stocks that represent weak companies. Anytime a business\u2019s prospects are weak, the stock should also be weak.\n\nThat\u2019s obvious advice but advice that has proven unreliable of late. Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), meme stocks and others have soared despite poor underlying business fundamentals.\n\nThat makes such stocks especially dangerous. Investors see meme stocks jump by double digits overnight and suddenly decide to pull the trigger and buy. Then the investment sharply crashes in value days later. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that repeats over and over and is increasing in frequency as social media influences the stock market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe best thing to do is to cash out your investment in the stocks discussed below. That\u2019s true whether you\u2019re currently in a winning position or losing because they\u2019re almost guaranteed to fall further.\n\nNikola (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) Tre BEV electric truck at the Hannover IAA Transportation Motor Show. Germany\n\nSource: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) has long been a stock to avoid. It was supposed to be one of the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer challengers to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) when it emerged back in 2020. The company IPO\u2019d via a SPAC and was flying high.\n\nThose hopes were dashed just as quickly by beginning with a report from Hindenburg Research levying strong allegations towards CEO Trevor Milton.\n\nThat saga has been told and retold. The company has since pivoted into hydrogen-powered EV drivetrains. Some want you to believe the company has course corrected and it has to some degree. The company delivered 40 of its hydrogen-powered EV semi trucks during the last quarter, up from 31 a year earlier. The problem, though, is the company continues to lose mountains of money. The prospect of profitability is not even a consideration at the moment. Shares trade for 50 cents and offer almost no stability. The potential for them to crash out is very high and they should be avoided.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nRealistically speaking, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock has already crashed out. It isn\u2019t about to drop quickly; it already has.\n\nShares fell off a cliff on May 8 when the company issued a terrible earnings report. The primary driver sending share prices from $77 to $58 was a surprise first-quarter loss. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 9 cents per share so when the company reported a 21-cent loss, shares plummeted. The company blamed the loss on fees incurred from the sale of its logistics business.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhatever the cause, the markets continue to be forward-looking. Unfortunately, Shopify gave uninspiring guidance for the second quarter. Wall Street was looking for nearly 20% top-line growth in Q2 but Shopify is projecting mid- to high-teen percentage growth.\n\nShopify stock has been all over the place during 2024. It is very volatile overall. It peaked above $90 and is currently below $60. It is far too dangerous and the slightest bit of negative news moving forward promises to send it plummeting again.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is my pick for the most overhyped artificial intelligence (AI) stock of the last year and a half. The company continues to be mentioned with the ranks of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the true winners of the AI boom. However, the company\u2019s continued losses combined with recent earnings make it particularly dangerous at the moment.\n\nC3.ai is currently getting a lot of attention for its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that came out on May 29. It showed revenues grew by 20% during the period but also showed subscription revenue jumping by 41%, constituting 92% of overall revenues.\n\nI think the relatively strong report is going to cause some investors to overreact with bullishness. Those investors will continue to follow the narrative that C3.ai is amongst the very best enterprise AI stocks. Those same investors will also ignore the fact that C3.ai produced more than $72 million in net losses during the period, up by $6 million on a year-over-year basis.\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) most recent resurgence should serve as proof to investors that the company doesn\u2019t care. The stock has again spiked in price following the return of Roaring Kitty to social media. The influencer was a central figure in the meme stock rally of 2021.\n\nWhile his influence remains very strong it\u2019s also clear that GameStop is entirely unpredictable. The company just completed an at-the-market offering worth $933.4 million. The news served to temporarily spike prices, which is highly unusual given that at-the-market offerings are not a good sign overall.\n\nGameStop executives must recognize that there is no logic behind all of the recent movements that have sent share prices higher. Those executives are simply looking to make money by any means possible. That\u2019s why the company issued all of those additional shares.\n\nThe company noted that the proceeds would go toward general corporate purposes. Of course, if you have a captive audience as uninterested in business fundamentals as GameStop investors, why not take advantage of it? More sensible investors will understand there is no real value in investing in the video game retailer.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Exterior of Lucid Motors (LCID) building\n\nSource: gg5795 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are many pieces of information on Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) that should serve as warnings to avoid the stock. Perhaps none is more jarring than the abrupt decline in delivery projections.\n\nNot long ago, the company projected that it would be delivering 90,000 vehicles in 2024. Today, the company has slashed that projection to 9,000.\n\nTo say that some manufacturers in the EV space have underdelivered would be a serious understatement. Lucid is chief among those firms. The company is staggeringly bad from a fundamental perspective.\n\nLucid produced a net loss in excess of $680 million in the first quarter. The company lost more than 3$ billion in 2023.\n\nThe losses per vehicle produced are truly staggering. Lucid loses hundreds of thousands of dollars on each vehicle manufactured because it simply doesn\u2019t sell at nearly the volume required to make the business succeed. There is no realistic reason to be optimistic about Lucid\u2019s prospects at the moment and for that reason, investors should be worried instead.\n\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) In this photo illustration the Upstart (UPST) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST) stock has been substantially devalued in 2024. While the company has shown some improvement, it remains very dangerous and has significant fundamental flaws.\n\nThe company is one of many aiming to revolutionize the personal lending space by leveraging advanced algorithms. It makes all the promises you would expect to hear out of a pitch from such a company. AI is going to make its lending practices fairer and more accessible.\n\nTo the company\u2019s credit, it grew the top line by 24% in the first quarter. And Upstart did manage to cut losses in half. However, losses remain large at $64.6 million.\n\nI seriously wonder what will happen to Upstart should anything go wrong. There\u2019s plenty of reason to believe that something could go wrong. Credit card debt is staggeringly high. Individual consumers believe they can simply borrow, borrow and borrow some more. Companies like Upstart are built on that premise. However, the company continues to lose money so despite growth and declining losses there is plenty of potential for something to go abruptly and seriously wrong.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) continues to head in the wrong direction. Any reasonable investor can see the stock represents substantial risk overall.\n\nAll one has to do is look at the most recent earnings report in order to come to that conclusion. Revenue fell by 18% during the first quarter while net losses remained very high at $54.4 million. The company didn\u2019t make any sort of positive progress that would suggest fundamental improvement at all.\n\nHowever, the stock benefited from the recent surge in meme stocks. It looked like the company might skyrocket higher on short squeeze hopes. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to predict whether or not a short squeeze will manifest itself. While investors can chase metrics like high percentages of float sold short, those same investors will readily admit such metrics can remain exceedingly high for long periods of time with no ensuing short squeeze.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how investors lose money time and time again. I can\u2019t predict whether that will happen for Beyond Meat but I can say investors should simply avoid it for its weak fundamentals and declining business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures tread water in evening deals on Monday as investors awaited upcoming interest rate cuts in Europe and Canada this week, while a slew of key readings on the U.S. labor market were also on tap.\n\nTrading on Monday was disrupted by a series of technical glitches on the New York Stock Exchange, which caused volatility and trading halts in several major stocks. But the issues were resolved towards the end of the session, and trading resumed as normal.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,300.25 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1 to 18,662.50 points by 19:23 ET (23:23 GMT). Dow Jones Futures steadied at 38,668.0 points.\n\nRate cut speculation increases amid weak economic data\n\nInvestors were seen ramping up bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September, as a swathe of recent readings showed the U.S. economy was cooling.\n\nThe CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in a 52.5% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September, up from a 47% chance seen yesterday.\n\nPurchasing managers index data for May showed manufacturing activity slowed for a second straight month, with the reading coming just days after U.S. gross domestic product data was revised lower in the first quarter.\n\nFocus this week is on key nonfarm payrolls data, with the labor market being another major consideration for the Fed in cutting rates. JOLTS job openings data is due on Tuesday.\n\nThe Fed is also set to meet next week and keep rates steady.\n\nBut before the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada are both widely expected to cut interest rates this week.\n\nWall Street buoyed by Nvidia on new AI chips\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% to finish at 5,283.40 points on Monday, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.6% to 16,828.63 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 38,71.03 points.\n\nTechnology stocks- chiefly NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), were the biggest supporter of Wall Street. The chipmaker surged nearly 5% on Monday and was close to record highs in aftermarket trade, after it unveiled a new line of processors for artificial intelligence.\n\nIts smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 2% even after it unveiled new AI chips aimed at competing with Nvidia.\n\nGameStop surges as influencer Roaring Kitty reveals $116 mln bet\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) closed 21% higher at $28.0 after surging as much as 78% on Monday.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- It was just a screenshot of a portfolio, posted without comment on Reddit by an account associated with Keith Gill.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKey Engines of US Consumer Spending Are Losing Steam All at Once GameStop Shares Surge as Gill\u2019s Reddit Return Shows Huge Bet Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money Homebuyers Are Starting to Revolt Over Steep Prices Across US AMLO Protege Sheinbaum Becomes First Female President in Mexico\n\nBut assuming the unverified image in fact reflects his actual holdings, it showed the man who goes by the monikers DeepF\u2014-ingValue and Roaring Kitty was worth as much as $485 million on Monday.\n\nGill \u2014 who played a starring role in 2021\u2019s meme-stock mania and inspired a legion of individual investors to prop up shares of GameStop Corp. \u2014 didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nA day after the image was posted, shares of the video game retailer surged by as much as 75% in New York. Ginning up euphoria over GameStop is familiar territory for Gill, who became a folk hero and Wall Street bete noire after a series of videos he posted about the company more than three years ago fueled a runaway rally in the stock, inflicting dramatic losses on hedge funds betting against it.\n\nRead More: GameStop Shares Surge as Gill\u2019s Reddit Return Shows Huge Bet\n\nGill testified about the episode before Congress in 2021, and his exploits served as grist for last year\u2019s film Dumb Money, where he was portrayed by actor Paul Dano.\n\nRegardless of the recent screenshot\u2019s provenance, the jolt to GameStop stock served as a reminder of the outsize impact Gill\u2019s well-known Reddit account still wields. The image shows 5 million shares of GameStop and 120,000 call options expiring June 21, as well as more than $29 million in cash.\n\nThe options would allow the purchase of an additional 12 million shares. The position could hypothetically make him the retailer\u2019s fourth-largest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nShares of GameStop retreated from their highs, but were still up 34% to $30.94 at 1:42 pm in New York, making the portfolio worth roughly $340 million.\n\nThe cryptic post bears a notable difference from the last time DeepF\u2014-kingValue shared a similar snapshot in April 2021, which showed a GameStop position worth just $31 million.\n\nGill\u2019s social media accounts had been dormant for more than three years until last month, when Roaring Kitty resurfaced on X, posting an image of a man leaning forward in a chair. Fans took the hieroglyph as an indication their beloved leader was back in action, and bid up the shares. Still, GameStop shares are trading almost 67% below their January 2021 peak.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track The Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Israel Seeks Underground Secrets by Tracking Cosmic Particles How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop (GME) stock surged on Monday after user \"DeepF***ingValue\" on Reddit, an account believed to be tied to individual investor Keith Gill \u2014 who ignited the meme stock rally back in 2021 \u2014 posted a screenshot on Reddit late Sunday that purported to show they paid nearly $175 million building a position in the video game retailer.\n\nGill is also known as Roaring Kitty on X and YouTube. The user posted the screenshot Sunday night on Reddit's Superstonk subreddit.\n\nGameStop gained as much as 75% at the market open after doubling at one point during premarket trading; near 10 a.m. ET, the stock was up closer to 35%.\n\nThe screenshot showed holdings of 5 million GameStop shares purchased at an average price of $21.274, a position worth $115.7 million as of Friday's closing price of $23.14. GameStop shares traded hands at $38 each in early trading Monday before they were temporarily halted for volatility.\n\nThe account also appears to own 120,000 options contracts that expire on June 21. These contracts confer the right to buy GameStop shares at $20 each, a position worth $65.7 million as of Friday's close.\n\nSteve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist, warned investors against chasing the rally.\n\n\"Is whoever controlling this account doing this in your best interest or in their best interest? And, really, you should think that one through because, to me, it [is] pretty obvious whose interest it's in,\" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance on Monday.\n\n\"If you're chasing the stock up here, you're more likely than not the source of liquidity for whoever is controlling this account to sell into your enthusiasm.\" A screenshot that appears to show GameStop holdings by \"DeepF***king Value\" was posted on Reddit late Sunday, June 2, 2024. (Source: Reddit)\n\nMonday's surge comes after GameStop rallied 180% over a span of two days back in mid-May after \"Roaring Kitty\" posted for the first time on X, formerly known as Twitter, since 2021.\n\nLast month's rally was short-lived, as analysts warned the meme action this time around was a far cry from the level of retail inflows seen in 2021.\n\nStill, GameStop capitalized on May's rally. Last month, the company sold 45 million shares, bringing in around $930 million in proceeds. The stock surged 25% on the news.\n\nTypically, investors would expect the stock price of a company issuing new shares \u2014 which dilute the value of current holdings \u2014 to decline after a stock sale.\n\nAMC (AMC) also capitalized on the meme frenzy, raising $250 million through the sale of 72.5 million shares last month. AMC shares were up about 10% on Monday.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Mid-May saw a round of meme stock rallies when Keith Gill, a.k.a Roaring Kitty, made a surprise return \u2014 in true meme fashion \u2014 on social media. Roaring Kitty is the trader from Massachusetts who instigated the infamous meme stock breakout in 2021 that pitted retail investors against Wall Street.\n\nHis reappearance signaled to retail investors that another meme rally was here and caused several stocks to rise by three-digit percentage points.\n\nBut these types of rallies tend not to be sustainable, which is why you might want to consider these meme stocks to sell while you still can.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is the quintessential meme stock, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s the first on this list. But the primary reason I\u2019m including it as a meme stock to sell is that GameStop\u2019s fundamentals and longevity prospects have been shaky for years now.\n\nGME share price increase nearly sixfold from late April through the start of trading on May 14 before sinking over 20% by market close.\n\nIt shot up again over 20% after the video-game store chain announced it had cashed in $933 million from the meme stock surge this month.\n\nHowever, this meme rally alone will not fix GameStop\u2019s.\n\nGameStop\u2019s business model involves\u00a0 customers walking into its brick-and-mortar stores to buy video games, gaming merchandise and consumer electronics.\n\nThe problem is customers are increasingly going online for those types of solutions \u2014 something that has proven detrimental to the firm\u2019s survivability prospects. Unless it goes back to the drawing board, GameStop has serious headwinds ahead. It makes GME stock some of the meme stocks to sell at the moment.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Theatres (NYSE:AMC) has been hanging on by a thread for years now.\n\nBetween the lingering effects of Covid-19 \u2014 when moviegoers stayed home to Hollywood\u2019s recent labor strikes and increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to being billions in debt, the movie theater chain is barely keeping above water.\n\nIts occasional savior has been retail investors, who heavily bought its stock in 2021 and this month after Roaring Kitty\u2019s re-emergence on X.\n\nAnother shot in its arm was singers Taylor Swift and Beyonce\u2019s concert films \u2014 whose direct distribution deals with the company last year padded its bottom line for the time being.\n\nBut the company has a long way to go before it can become profitable again, and these random lifelines will not suffice to keep it afloat in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC stock\u2019s over 100% climb on Roaring Kitty\u2019s return this month cemented its status as a meme stock and is one you want to sell ASAP.\n\nBlackberry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo.

BB stock. meme stocks to sell\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackberry (NYSE:BB) stock rose this month in tandem with other meme stocks, but it is a meme stock to sell while you still can.\n\nThe BlackBerry company is another casualty of being caught being on the wrong side of a fast-changing business environment \u2014 just like GamesStop and AMC in their respective niches.\n\nBlackBerry was once a roaring success as a phone maker but was edged out of the market by Alphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS.\n\nIt has since rebranded itself as a cybersecurity and IoT software developer and had some success. For instance, for the 2024 fiscal year, it declared $853 million in revenue, with its IoT business reporting a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue jump.\n\nBut the same can\u2019t be said for its stock. Its share price has declined 48% YOY and 50% from the same time two years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s clear BlackBerry has some work to do to win back investor confidence. Until then, it\u2019s right there with other meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Video games continue to be one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world. Nearly 50 years after the first video game consoles debuted, the industry is stronger and more diverse than ever. According to Midia Research, the video games industry will reach global annual revenues of more than $300 billion and a worldwide audience of 3.8 billion active players by 2030.\n\nConsumers today are spending more on video games than they are on going to the movies, streaming TV shows, and many other forms of entertainment. For companies operating in the sector, gaming continues to be very lucrative, especially as the industry migrates online and away from brick-and-mortar retail outlets such as GameStop (NYSE:GME).\n\nWith the industry showing no signs of slowing down, we look at three video game stocks better equipped to beat the market slump than GameStop.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is such a diversified company that people forget it\u2019s one of the biggest video game companies in the world. And Microsoft\u2019s position within the video game sector has gotten larger and more influential following its successful $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, which it completed last autumn. Today, Microsoft not only makes the Xbox console but also publishes popular video game such as \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush.\u201d\n\nIn its first-quarter financial results, Microsoft noted that revenue from the Xbox rose 62% year over year. This comes as it successfully integrates Activision Blizzard and benefits from sales of its games. Going forward, Microsoft says it is adding artificial intelligence (AI) to its video games to deepen the experience for users and make them more immersive. With MSFT stock, investors also get a leading AI, cloud computing and software company.\n\nMicrosoft stock is up 26% over the last 12 months.\n\nNintendo (NTDOY) A yellow Switch Lite from Nintendo (NTDOY) sits in front of a bright pink background.\n\nSource: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com\n\nJapanese video game company Nintendo (OTC:NTDOY) is one of the biggest and best-known video game companies in the world. Video game characters such as Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong are household names all over the world. The company had a great year in 2023 thanks to the release of the hugely successful animated \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Movie\u201d and the release of a blockbuster new Zelda video game.\n\nWhile NTDOY stock is up 26% over the last year, it has slumped in recent months on reports that the company is delaying the launch of its new Switch 2 game console. Nintendo has told game publishers that the next version of its flagship console will be delayed until 2025. The company initially planned to release a new version of the Switch this autumn in time for year-end holiday shopping.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first-generation Switch console is now seven years old and analysts say a new version is needed. Despite its age, the Switch continues to be a worldwide bestseller with Nintendo forecasting 2024 sales of 15.5 million units. This video game stock has gained 26% over the past year.\n\nTurtle Beach (HEAR) Image of a gamer with a headset facing a screen\n\nSource: Donna Lupgens / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking beyond console makers and game publishers, we have Turtle Beach (NASDAQ:HEAR), a gaming accessory manufacturer based in San Diego, California. In business since the dawn of the video game industry back in 1975, Turtle Beach today is primarily known for making headsets that gamers wear. Other products made by the company include controllers, joy sticks and even a mouse designed specifically for gaming.\n\nTurtle Beach has built a rabid fanbase among gamers and this has led to brisk sales and a lofty share price. HEAR stock has been on fire this year, rising 63% since January. Over the last five years, the share price has doubled. Analysts like this video game stock and see more gains ahead.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Shares in Gamestop surged by over 90% in premarket trading on Monday, after a weekend Reddit post from stocks influencer Keith Gill, known as \"Roaring Kitty,\" showed a $116 million bet on the gaming retailer.\n\nGameStop was the second-most actively traded stock, with 4.4 million shares changing hands by 4:30 a.m. ET.\n\nIt was the first post from Gill's Reddit account, which was central in fuelling a meme stock trading frenzy about three years ago by sharing screenshots of his bullish GameStop trades.\n\nThe screenshot posted on Sunday also showed $20 call options for GameStop expiring on June 21. The stock closed at $23 on Friday, up about 33% since Gill began sharing cryptic posts and memes on X.com in May, sparking speculation over whether he would resume sharing his trades online after a three-year hiatus.\n\nGill did not respond to a request for comment on Reddit or email.\n\nReddit shares jumped 7.5%, while retail trader-focused brokerage Robinhood gained 3.5%.\n\nAmong other meme stocks, AMC added 30%, Tupperware gained 12%, U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry rose 7.8%.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Amanda Cooper; Editing by Alun John and Varun H K)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop Memecoin Surges Over 300% After \"Roaring Kitty\" Reveals $181.4 Million Stake\n\nThe GameStop (GME) stock saw a dramatic surge of over 19% in overnight trading following a post by Keith Gill, famously known as \"Roaring Kitty\" on Reddit. Gill, a key figure in the 2021 GME short squeeze phenomenon, announced he holds $181.4 million worth of GameStop stock and call options. Following this news, the GameStop (GME) memecoin on Solana surged more than 300% to reach a market cap of $105 million. It is up an astonishing 2850% in the past month, since Roaring Kitty returned by posting on X.\n\nOn June 2, Gill made his first Reddit post since April 2021, using his \"DeepFuckingValue\" account. He shared a screenshot purportedly showing his acquisition of 5 million GME shares for $115.7 million, alongside a $65.7 million investment in call options, betting that the stock would hit at least $20 per share by June 21. The screenshot indicated that Gill has made a profit of over $9.3 million on his GME holdings while currently sitting on a loss of nearly $2.5 million from his call options.\n\nFollowing Gill's post, GameStop's stock price on Robinhood's overnight markets spiked by 19.19% within 20 minutes, reaching $27.58. This jump came after the stock closed at $23.14 on Friday, May 31. The shares have risen 38.8% this year, a gain seemingly driven by Gill's recent reappearance.\n\nGill's activity is not confined to Reddit. He has also been posting enigmatic content on X, including a cryptic green UNO reverse card, contributing to a series of mysterious posts and memes since his sudden return in mid-May. This return has evidently reinvigorated interest and speculation around GameStop.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Shop for Profits: 3 Retail Stocks That Are Adapting and Succeeding in 2024",
        "content": "Wall Street is watching the evolution of the retail landscape stateside as e-commerce continues to disrupt traditional retail models. In recent years, many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled to adapt, leading to store closures, layoffs and declining sales. However, some retailers have successfully become part of the new retail landscape. These players prioritize seamless omnichannel experiences, strategic diversification and exceptional customer service. The companies demonstrate an understanding of the modern consumer and are actively shaping the future of retail. For investors, identifying such robust retail stocks presents a significant opportunity.\n\nIn this article, we spotlight three retail stocks that are adapting and succeeding in 2024. These retailers stand as robust examples of resilience, innovation and strategic foresight, making them worthy additions to long-term portfolios.\n\nAutoZone (AZO) An AutoZone (AZO) storefront in Saint Augustine, Florida.\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of retail stocks is AutoZone (NYSE:AZO). It is a leading retailer and distributor of automotive aftermarket parts and accessories in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil. Beyond replacement parts, AutoZone also caters to the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional mechanic markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe automotive parts company reported positive financial results for the third quarter of 2024 in April. Net sales increased 3.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.2 billion. Net income for the quarter was $651.7 million compared to $647.7 million in the same period last year, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 7.5% to $36.69.\n\nWall Street noted that AutoZone expanded its retail footprint by 45 new stores in the quarter, reaching a total of 7,236 locations. Beyond physical expansion, management is focused on growing its domestic commercial business, which it believes is the key driver of future growth and profitability. In addition, AutoZone is implementing initiatives to improve customer service and expand parts availability through its hub network.\n\nAs a result, AZO stock has gained more than 7% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 16.8 times forward earnings and 2.8 times sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $3,250 for AZO, signaling more than a 17% upside.\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGeneral merchandise retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) is the next name among our retail stocks for today. The company offers a diverse range of products, including apparel, home goods, electronics, groceries, dairy, toys, beauty and more. In general, Target differentiates itself through its focus on curated product lines, exclusive brand partnerships and a robust digital presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Target reported revenue of $25.53 billion, marking a 3.1% decline compared to the year-ago period due to softer sales trends. Net earnings declined 0.8% YOY to $942 million. Diluted EPS also dropped 1% YOY to come in at $2.03.\n\nMeanwhile, in March, management announced a multi-faceted strategy to enhance the customer experience and fuel long-term growth. The plan centers on revamping its successful Target Circle loyalty program with a tiered membership structure and personalized features. Additionally, the company will focus on expanding its successful $30 billion-plus owned brand portfolio with new, on-trend items. Finally, Target plans to build hundreds of new stores and invest in existing locations, aiming to reach new customers.\n\nSo far in 2024, TGT stock has appreciated over 5%. The stock is currently trading at an attractive 16.1 times forward earnings and 0.65 times sales. Shares also have a robust dividend yield of 3.0%. And Wall Street remains optimistic about the prospects of TGT stock, with a 12-month median price forecast of $180. Such an increase in the price of Target shares would suggest a potential upside of 20%.\n\nSPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) a person carrying several shopping bags\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRounding out our discussion on retail stocks is the SPDR S&P Retail ETF(NYSEARCA:XRT). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracks the overall performance of the U.S. retail sector. These retailers come from a diverse set of sub-industries, including apparel, electronics, department stores and specialty stores.\n\nSince its inception in June 2006, net assets have grown close to $356 million. XRT currently has 79 holdings, while the top 10 names comprise about a fifth of the fund. The leading sectors in the fund include apparel retail (22.8%), automotive retail (20.5%), other specialty retail (20.3%) and broadline retail (13%). Warby Parker (NYSE:WRBY), Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ:SFM), GameStop (NYSE:GME), Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) and Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) are among the leading stocks.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, XRT has advanced close to 6%. Yet, the current valuation appears favorable, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 14.56 and 2.67, respectively. Given the importance of the retail sector for our economy, we\u2019re bullish on the XRT as the fund hovers around multi-year highs. Interested investors should also note the current dividend yield of 1.26% and annual expense ratio of 0.35%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Meme Stocks That Could Be Millionaire-Makers: May Edition",
        "content": "Meme stocks were big wealth creators for retail investors during the euphoric rally of 2021. Price-action in some stocks in the recent past might indicate that the meme stock season is returning. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock was trading at $10 in April. By the second week of May, GME stock had touched 52-week highs of $64.8. Similarly, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock has skyrocketed by 265% in the last month.\n\nOf course, these are selected instances of stock frenzy. I believe it\u2019s likely to be more widespread in the coming quarters. An important point to note is that the last meme stock euphoria was when interest rates were low. Easy money translates into higher speculative activity. With potential rate cuts in the coming quarters, there is a strong reason to believe that speculative activity will surge.\n\nThis column discusses three meme stocks to buy that have millionaire-make potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarathon Digital (MARA) In this photo illustration, the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is my first pick among meme stocks that can be millionaire-makers. MARA stock has surged by 115% in the last 12 months. However, considering the impending growth, a forward P/E of 38 looks attractive. I must add that valuations can go through the roof in a meme stock frenzy.\n\nThe first point to note is that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has been in a zone of consolidation above $60,000. With potential rate cuts and rising cryptocurrency adoption, I am bullish on a significant upside from current levels. As one of the largest Bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital is well-positioned to benefit from this.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Marathon reported an energized hash rate of 27.8EH/s, which was higher by 142% yearly. It\u2019s worth noting that the company is targeting to increase capacity to 50EH/s by the end of the year. This is likely to translate into stellar revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth adding that Marathon ended Q1 with a cash buffer of $1.6 billion. This provides ample flexibility for financing aggressive growth plans.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding cellphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has been a participant in the meme stock euphoria of 2021. However, PLUG stock has subsequently been in a downtrend. The reasons include cash burn and doubts about the execution capability of ambitious plans.\n\nWith the meme frenzy on the cards, I expect a big rally for PLUG stock from deeply oversold levels. I would not be surprised if the stock delivers 5x or 10x returns in quick time.\n\nSpecific to the company, the biggest upside catalyst is the conditional commitment for an up to $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy. The funds will be utilized to construct and own up to six green hydrogen production facilities. The backing of the U.S. DoE will likely instill some confidence in investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlug Power has also focused on international expansion. Recently, the company expanded cryogenic sales with multiple customer agreements in international markets. Plug Power also secured Korea\u2019s first international PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolyzer certification. These favorable business developments are likely to support a massive meme stock rally.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration, the Tilray Brands (TLRY) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Presidential elections due, it\u2019s a good time to buy cannabis stocks. When President Biden was elected in 2021, cannabis stocks had skyrocketed. With an overwhelming majority of Americans in favor of the legalization of cannabis, it\u2019s likely to be a topic of discussion during the election campaigns. This will trigger price action in some quality stocks.\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. I believe a big upside breakout is likely in the coming quarters. In recent news, Tilray has announced a $250 million at-the-market program. The proceeds will be used to fund potential acquisitions once cannabis is reclassified as a Schedule III drug in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Tilray reported healthy revenue growth of 30% on a year-on-year basis for Q3 2024. This momentum has been supported by healthy growth in international cannabis revenue. Further, with acquisitions in 2023, Tilray has diversified and positioned itself as the fifth-largest craft beer brewer in the United States. With all these developments, there are strong reasons to believe TLRY stock will go ballistic.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Best Buy (BBY) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12.15%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer electronics retailer would post earnings of $2.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.72, delivering a surprise of 8.37%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBest Buy , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Consumer Electronics industry, posted revenues of $8.85 billion for the quarter ended April 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $9.47 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nBest Buy shares have lost about 8.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.4%.\n\nWhat's Next for Best Buy?\n\nWhile Best Buy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Best Buy: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.21 on $9.3 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.02 on $42.02 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Consumer Electronics is currently in the bottom 5% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, GameStop (GME), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.\n\nThis video game retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 16.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nGameStop's revenues are expected to be $900 million, down 27.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A company that went along for the ride was CytomX Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CTMX), as CytomX Therapeutics stock took a round trip from $1.80 to $5.80 and back. Serious investors should consider buying shares of CytomX Therapeutics.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics develops cancer-treatment candidates through the company\u2019s PROBODY\u00a0therapeutic platform. This company is trying to save lives and is not a meme or a joke. In fact, CytomX Therapeutics is working diligently with a famous Big Pharma company on a crucial collaboration, so let\u2019s delve into the details right now.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics Partners With a Pharma Giant\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know. CytomX Therapeutics is teaming up withMerck (NYSE:MRK) on a clinical trial. Together, they\u2019ll assess CytomX Therapeutics\u2019 cytokine, CX-801, in a combination therapy with Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), to treat tumors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis is certainly exciting from a medical standpoint. Wayne Chu, chief medical officer of CytomX Therapeutics, emphasized that this proposed combination therapy is intended to treat \u201ca broad range of tumor types.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, CytomX Therapeutics CEO Sean McCarthy proposed that the combination therapy could be a \u201chighly effective regimen to significantly improve the outcomes of patients with cancer.\u201d\n\nThis could be a game changer and a life changer, since CytomX Therapeutics will have access to Merck\u2019s vast capital and human resources in this collaboration.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics Pivots to Profitability\n\nMerck wouldn\u2019t team up with a company that\u2019s falling apart at the seams. Granted, biotech businesses can be risky ventures. However, there\u2019s evidence that CytomX Therapeutics is in excellent fiscal condition.\n\nFor one thing, CytomX Therapeutics recorded revenue of $41.463 million in 2024\u2019s first quarter. That\u2019s up 76.4% year over year compared to the $23.499 million that CytomX Therapeutics generated in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nMoreover, CytomX Therapeutics reported Q1-2024 total comprehensive income of $13.686 million. This shows vast improvement over the company\u2019s total comprehensive loss of $3.295 million in 2023\u2019s first quarter.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics grew its revenue substantially and pivoted to profitability. Thus, CytomX Therapeutics is capable of firming up its financials even while tirelessly advancing potentially lifesaving treatments.\n\nCytomX Therapeutics Stock: No Need to Obsess Over Memes Now\n\nThere\u2019s no need to think about meme stocks when you\u2019re learning about CytomX Therapeutics. This company is serious and is doing important work with Merck now. Plus, CytomX Therapeutics is on solid ground from a financial standpoint.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, please don\u2019t put CytomX Therapeutics in the same category as GameStop. Instead, consider the medical progress that CytomX Therapeutics and Merck could make in 2024 and afterwards. With that in mind, serious investors should think about buying CytomX Therapeutics stock while it\u2019s below $2.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Tuesday after a rally in market darling Nvidia drove the Nasdaq to new highs, with focus remaining on upcoming inflation data and more cues on interest rates.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) extended some gains into aftermarket trade after surging some 7% during the session on hype over artificial intelligence. The stock was now nearing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-largest listed firm on Wall Street.\n\nBut this did not translate into strength in Wall Street futures, as broader stocks remained subdued on growing caution over U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.1% to 5,321.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at 18,939.75 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 39,898.0 points.\n\nNvidia drives Nasdaq to record highs, but broader sentiment subdued\n\nGains in Nvidia saw the NASDAQ Composite rise 0.6% to a record high of 17,019.88 points on Tuesday. The stock was boosted chiefly by hype over AI, especially after Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk raised $6 billion for his AI venture.\n\nNvidia is the third-largest stock on Wall Street, and also helped the S&P 500 close marginally higher, although the index remained well below recent peaks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average- which is more economically sensitive than its peers, fell 0.6% to 38,852.86 points.\n\nRate jitters mount amid hawkish Fedspeak, PCE watch\n\nBroader U.S. stocks were largely subdued in anticipation of key inflation data this week. PCE price index data, which is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, is due this Friday, and is likely to factor into the central bank\u2019s outlook on interest rates.\n\nBefore that, hawkish warnings from Fed officials continued to pour in. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned on Tuesday that the Fed had still not ruled out rate hikes, especially in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nMore Fed officials, including New York Fed President John Williams and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are set to speak before Friday\u2019s PCE reading.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Beige Book report is due on Wednesday, while a revised reading on first-quarter economic growth is also due on Thursday.\n\nAfterhours movers: American Airlines dips, Robinhood jumps\n\nAmong major aftermarket movers, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) sank over 6% after it cut its second-quarter earnings forecast on a more subdued outlook on travel demand.\n\nThis pulled down broader airline stocks, with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) and Spirit Airlines Inc (NYSE:SAVE) down between 0.8% to 2.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) rose 4.3% after it unveiled a stock buyback of $1 billion.\n\nMeme stock GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) fell 1.7% after surging 25% during the session on raising $933 million in share sales.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after Nvidia rally; Fed cues in focus\n\nUS judge rejects Amazon bid to get FTC lawsuit tossed over Prime program\n\nAmid merger speculation, Brazilian airline Gol parent talks with Azul\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Grab your Dramamine. GameStop stock is on the move again.\n\nShares of the video game retailer surged more than 25% in the pre-market Monday before losing some of those gains. As of 11:00 a.m. ET, the stock was still up more than 17%.\n\nThe surge follows the company\u2019s announcement that it had made $933 million in the sale of 45 million common shares of its stock. Ironically, the initial announcement of that stock sale earlier this month resulted in the share price falling.\n\nThe trampoline-like performance of the company is becoming something of a pattern as retail investors battle short sellers over the meme stock. For the latest round, the social media account Roaring Kitty, the nom de plume of investor Keith Gill, has been leading the charge.\n\nGill, though, is apparently sitting this round out. His meme-filled Twitter feed has been quiet since May 17, when he posted a meme indicating he was once again planning to go silent. (Before his post earlier this month, he had avoided social media for three years.)\n\nIn the past month, GameStop shares are up more than 98%\u2014and they\u2019re up 35% year to date.\n\nGameStop\u2019s problems have hardly vanished, though. When announcing the sale of the additional shares, the company also said it expects first-quarter sales to range between $872 million to $892 million, considerably lower than the $1.24 billion it made in the same quarter last year and below analyst estimates of $1 billion.\n\nAnalysts applauded the issuance of new shares, but weren\u2019t any more optimistic about the company\u2019s long-term health.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe GameStop can \u2018save its way to prosperity\u2019, and expect the mix of software sales to continue to shift to digital and away from physical,\u201d said Michael Pachter of Wedbush in a note to investors earlier this month. \u201cWhile there will likely be a new Nintendo console next year and an overall lift in software sales from GTA VI, we think GameStop will see continuing sales declines next year as well. Ultimately, the company must deploy its cash productively or continue to hope that it can issue more shares at elevated levels to forestall the inevitable.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop (GME) stock surged as much as 22% on Tuesday after the video game retailer said it raised almost $1 billion from its latest equity offering.\n\nGameStop shares opened at around $23, well below the near $65 level reached earlier this month during a short-lived meme rally.\n\nStill, Tuesday's stock action reflects investor exuberance when it comes to meme stocks, or those bid up through online buzz to the point that they become detached from fundamentals, according to one strategist.\n\n\u201cIf this were a normal market, people would be a little freaked out,\u201d Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \u201cYou don\u2019t sell stock into the market if you think your stock is undervalued. You do it when you think your stock is overvalued.\u201d\n\nGameStop is a heavily shorted stock, with short interest just above 21% of the float.\n\nThe company took advantage of mid-May's unexpected meme rally, selling 45 million shares to bring in about $933 million, according to a Friday statement.\n\nGameStop said it intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\n\nThe offering was first announced on May 17 along with the company\u2019s preliminary financial results, sending shares tanking as much as 30% that day.\n\nThe offering was seen as a smart move by some Wall Street analysts amid the video-game retailer\u2019s struggling financials. GameStop's quarterly sales fell sharply from the year earlier period, according to its most recent earnings report.\n\nGameStop's move to sell stock coincided with fellow meme stock play AMC Entertainment (AMC). The theater chain also capitalized on the meme frenzy by raising $250 million through the sale of 72.5 million shares, earlier this month.\n\nAMC shares rose more than 2% on Tuesday.\n\nGameStop soared over a two day span which started May 13 after the online reemergence of \"Roaring Kitty,\" the person who is seen as the kick-starter of the meme stock frenzy in 2021.

        "content": "Stock trading influencer Roaring Kitty \u2014 real name Keith Gill \u2014 made a sudden return on social media after a three-year silence.\n\nGill dropped from social media in the aftermath of 2021\u2019s GameStop (NYSE:GME) event, where institutional investors who shorted GME suffered major losses after retail investors bought it in droves.\n\nGME and other stocks that rallied in 2021 shot up again on his return, making it feel like 2021 all over again.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs of now, Roaring Kitty seems to have retreated from social media again. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t take advantage of the market excitement and snap up some stocks that have appreciated on his short-lived comeback.\n\nHere are three choice picks for speculative stocks to buy on the return of Roaring Kitty.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of a futuristic-looking silver airplane.\n\nVirgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is one of the companies that got caught up in that speculative stock buying in 2021.\n\nAnd on the return of Roaring Kitty, it reprised that role. Virgin Galactic stock added 19% on May 14 \u2014 although it dipped 33% at the close of Friday, May 24.\n\nBut SPCE isn\u2019t like other speculative stocks, such as GME, which has, in recent years, solely relied on social media sentiment for the occasional favorable performance.\n\nVirgin Galactic is part of a \u201cbillionaire space race,\u201d \u2014 with several ambitious companies trying to out-innovate each other. There is real potential for substantial growth return on investment (ROI) over the long term, which makes SPCE one of the best speculative stocks to buy.\n\nBut that\u2019s assuming, of course, it doesn\u2019t go bankrupt before actualizing its Delta Class passenger spacecraft launch in 2026. The company expects the new spaceships to rake in $450 million in revenue annually.\n\nSunPower (SPWR) In this photo illustration, the SunPower Corporation logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. SPWR stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn keeping with the meme stocks trend, SunPower\u2019s (NASDAQ:SPWR) shares appreciated over 100% on Roaring Kitty\u2019s re-emergence.\n\nBut that was a small reprieve for the California-based solar manufacturer, which has had a brutal one and half years thanks to broader industry problems and its own financial woes. Shares tanked 77% in 2023 before further shedding nearly 40% this year at the time of writing.\n\nHowever, it may not yet be time to write SunPower\u2019s obituary. Indeed, it may turn out to be one of the more promising stocks to buy. The solar energy sector is typically impacted by factors such as changes in government policy, partnerships or technological advancements.\n\nCase in point: SPWR stock climbed this month on the announcement that the firm had partnered with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to offer the Tesla Powerwall 3 storage battery.\n\nStory continues\n\nSunPower will also benefit from the Biden administration\u2019s rollout of tariffs on Chinese solar products and other goods.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is not strictly in the same bracket as the meme-driven GameStop. Still, the renewable energy company gained 8% amid retail investor interest on May 13 after Gill\u2019s post on X.\n\nBE share price further increased last week, following a price target hike by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) from $12 to $14 apiece.\n\nThe company has been witnessing increased demand from data centers that need its solid oxide fuel cells. The most notable of such interest is by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The two firms signed a power capacity agreement this month that will see \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s largest fuel cell-powered high-performance computing data center.\u201d\n\nIn its first quarter report, CEO KR Sridhar observed that in addition to data centers, the company views \u201cAI hardware supply-chain industries as a good growth opportunity for Bloom, both in the U.S. and in Asia.\u201d\n\nIn short, Bloom Energy\u2019s fundamentals look strong in the near future \u2014 at least. It may be a good fit for investors looking for speculative stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the coins mentioned in this article.

The moves come following an announcement on Friday that the company has completed a previously disclosed, roughly $933.4m (\u00a3730m) equity offering through the sale of 45 million shares.\n\nThe rally more than corrects losses of around 13% on Thursday last week.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed as UK shop price rises return to 'normal'\n\nGameStop's moves create something of a trend among memestocks in their equity strategy \u2014 they follow a $250m at-the-market equity offering by AMC earlier this month.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin hovered on a flat line against the dollar in London on Tuesday, as bitcoin and ethereum-backed exchange traded notes (ETNs) hit the London Stock Exchange for the first time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nETNs are traded and settled like regular shares and track the performance of underlying assets such as bitcoin or ether, similar to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January.\n\nRead more: Bitcoin ETNs debut on London Stock Exchange\n\nTheir launch comes after a price rally in recent weeks from around $59,000 to almost $68,500 on Tuesday.\n\nPrice spikes have been driven by ETF approvals for the likes of Blackrock and Fidelity and the bitcoin halving, which happens approximately every four years and involves a reduction in the number of bitcoins rewarded to miners.\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nIconic UK footwear brand Dr Martens is bracing for tough year ahead, as it warned last month that it's US business is going so badly it needs to extend paying for additional storage space. It also announced its chief executive's departure.\n\nHow the firm's future is set to become clearer when it reports results on Thursday.\n\nThe company has said pre-tax profits could fall by around two-thirds due to plunging US wholesale revenues and its decision not to hike prices to offset rising costs.

To provide insights into this trend, RapidRatings Executive Chair James Gellert joins Asking for a Trend.</p>\\n<p>The uptick in bankruptcies is not limited to the United States alone, as companies globally have been grappling with similar challenges, Gellert notes. He explains that the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 witnessed \\\"the highest incidence of Chapter 11 filings in a year.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Gellert attributes this surge in bankruptcies to the aftermath of a period characterized by cheap capital, low interest rates, and post-pandemic funding, which had previously allowed companies to stay afloat.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Meme stock GameStop soared nearly 20% in premarket trading on Tuesday after the struggling videogame retailer said it had raised over $900 million from selling its shares during the market rally earlier this month.\n\nGameStop surged as much as nearly six times its value in the first two weeks of May, partly fueled by the online return of \"Roaring Kitty\" Keith Gill, a key figure in the 2021 retail trading frenzy.\n\nThe stock has since lost 70% of its value up to Friday's close, taking GameStop's market value to $5.82 billion.\n\nThe company said it had raised $933.4 million after it completed its previously disclosed offering for 45 million shares. It intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\n\nThe brick-and-mortar retailer has been grappling with customers turning to e-commerce firms to buy video games and collectibles. It said earlier this month that it expected its first-quarter net sales to drop to between $872 million and $892 million, from $1.24 billion a year ago.\n\nTuesday's move could hurt short sellers of GameStop's shares, who bet on a stock's decline.\n\nAbout 20.5% of GameStop's publicly available shares were in a short position, data from analytics firm Ortex Technologies showed.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in GameStop (NYSE:GME) surged in premarket U.S. trading, extending gains made in extended hours on Friday after the video game retailer said it raked in more than $933 million from the sale of 45 million shares.\n\nThe company, a darling of retail investors that became a focal point of 2021's run up in so-called meme stocks, has been struggling to address competition to its brick-and-mortar stores from e-commerce rivals. GameStop warned last week that first-quarter net sales will likely drop to between $872 million and $892 million, down from $1.24 billion a year ago.\n\nBut, earlier this month, it disclosed plans to carry out a share sale following a renewed spike in its stock price that was spurred on by the return to social media of Keith Gill, who is known online as \"Roaring Kitty\" or \"DeepF------Value.\"\n\nGill, whose bullish outlook on GameStop helped propel the sharp increase in the firm's shares in 2021, posted a meme and several video clips. It was his first appearance on social media in about three years.\n\nGameStop's shares more than quadrupled from the end of April to May 14, but had given away about 60% of that uptick as of Friday's close.\n\nThe Texas-based group said it would use the proceeds from its most recent share sale for general corporate purposes. It did not disclose the price of the share sale, but the average price was estimated at $20.74 each, Reuters reported, citing its own calculations.\n\nBy 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT) on Tuesday, the stock was trading up 20% prior to the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGameStop shares surge premarket after raising $933 million from stock sale\n\nUBS: Foreign Investors Cautiously Optimistic Ahead of Indian Elections\n\nTesla shareholders advised to reject Musk's $56 billion pay\n\nView comments",

        "content": "'Let\u2019s punish predatory short selling': RFK Jr. invests $24,000 in GameStop, promises Wall Street reforms\n\nWhat do independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Keith Gill, a.k.a. Roaring Kitty, have in common?\n\nA passion for GameStop (GME) stock.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Cost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\nThe latter was a pivotal figure in the meme stock frenzy in early 2021. Through his YouTube videos and social media posts, Gill advocated for the potential of GameStop's undervalued shares, attracting a massive following of retail investors. This movement culminated in a dramatic short squeeze, where the stock price skyrocketed and short sellers betting against the stock were forced to buy it, sending it even higher.\n\nGameStop recently got back in the spotlight after Gill\u2019s return to social media. And now, Kennedy is in the game, too.\n\n\u201cI just invested $24,000 in GameStop from the fees I earned from suing Monsanto for their knowingly poisoning our soil and causing cancer,\u201d Kennedy wrote in a post on X.\n\n\u201cI love the idea of making Monsanto support $GME and the Apes. We need a free and fair market. Let\u2019s punish predatory short selling to the moon.\u201d\n\n\"Apes\" is a popular slang term for the retail investors who banded together to invest in GameStop and other stocks during the 2021 meme stock phonomenon. The term originated on social media and is a reference to the film series \"Planet of the Apes,\" symbolizing strength and unity among individual investors against the perceived dominance of hedge funds and institutional investors.\n\nKennedy tagged Gill in his post and used hashtags like #ApesNotLeaving and #ApesTogetherStrong to show his support for the movement. He also shared a presidential campaign poster depicting an ape and the words \u201cApes together strong\u201d in the same font as the film series\u2019 posters.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll ride with you\u2019\n\nKennedy\u2019s message seems to have struck a chord with X users. His post has received 4 million views, 20,000 likes and over 3,000 comments.\n\nWhile many are enthusiastic about GameStop\u2019s resurgence, it is important to remember that it remains a volatile stock.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop stock closed at $17.46 on Friday, May 10. On the evening of May 12, Gill posted a meme on X after a three-year hiatus on social media. This sparked a surge in GameStop\u2019s share price the next two days, closing at $48.75 on Tuesday, marking a remarkable gain of 179%.\n\nHowever, the stock has since pared most of those gains and is currently trading around $20. At the end of last week, the company revealed it had sold 45 million shares and made nearly $933.4 million as part of an \u201cat-the-market\u201d equity offering program disclosed earlier in the month.\n\nThis sent shares higher in extended trading.\n\nKennedy has expressed his intention to endure the volatility.\n\n\u201cI ride with you and I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile aligning with retail investors participating in the meme stock frenzy, Kennedy is challenging Wall Street\u2019s long-standing dominance in the investing world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware of what the average retail investor has been saying about the need for greater transparency in our markets, stronger regulatory oversight and tougher penalties for market manipulation and criminal behavior,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy administration will support the Ape retail rebellion and enact aggressive Wall Street reforms.\u201d\n\nWhat to read next\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse.

The stock jumped as much as 25% in extended trading to hit $23.80, however, it remains well below a peak of nearly $65 which it hit on May 14.\n\nThe move mirrored that of fellow meme-stock darling AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. which capitalized on share rallies earlier this month when both stocks saw spikes without fundamental updates. The movie theater shares gained alongside GameStop in late trading, rising 2.9% to $4.98 at 4:36 p.m. in New York.\n\nThe flash-in-the-pan flurries earlier this month were triggered by a post from the \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d account on X, the handle used by Keith Gill who operated under the moniker online and shot to fame in 2021 as he rallied traders on Reddit around GameStop.\n\nGameStop\u2019s so-called at-the-market program was announced earlier this month, a move that enabled its bank to create shares for sale, with the proceeds being added to its pile of cash that the company said would be around $1.1 billion prior to the funding. The company plans to use the haul for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments.\n\nThe video-game retailer\u2019s underlying business has struggled, with most gamers opting to download new titles in place of visiting brick-and-mortar stores.

What began as a fringe movement has now turned into a financial spectacle, catching the attention of institutional investors, regulators, and even the general public.\r\n\r\nKey question: are they the best form of investment for you? \r\n\r\nFirst, let's delve into the recent developments in the meme stock saga, analyze the forces at play, and provide insights on what this means for the broader market.\r\n\r\nThe Role of Social Media \r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the meme stock craze is the role of social media in driving market behavior. Platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok have become the battlegrounds where retail investors share ideas, strategies, and memes. The power of these communities was evident when a post on WallStreetBets could lead to a coordinated buying effort, sending a stock's price soaring.\r\n\r\nThe rise of meme stocks can be seen as a form of digital activism, where retail investors challenge the traditional power dynamics of Wall Street. By targeting heavily shorted stocks, these investors aim to inflict financial pain on hedge funds and other institutional players. It's a David vs. Goliath story that resonates with many who feel disenfranchised by the financial system.\r\n\r\nKeith Gill, known by his online moniker \"Roaring Kitty,\" has become an emblematic figure in the financial world, particularly during the GameStop (GME) rally. His unique blend of humor, insightful analysis, and unapologetic enthusiasm for GameStop made him a leader in the retail investor movement that shook Wall Street.\r\n\r\nGill's analysis was thorough and compelling. He identified GameStop as a deeply undervalued company with significant potential for turnaround, driven by its pivot to e-commerce and new leadership. His insights into the company\u2019s fundamentals, coupled with his entertaining delivery, garnered him a dedicated following.\r\n\r\nIn January 2021, Gill's investment thesis caught fire. Retail investors on WallStreetBets rallied behind his call, buying up shares and options on GameStop. This massive buying pressure triggered a short squeeze, forcing hedge funds with significant short positions to cover their bets, further driving up the stock price.\r\n\r\nGill's transparency about his own investments, including sharing screenshots of his trading account, added credibility and inspired confidence among fellow retail investors. As the stock soared, Roaring Kitty\u2019s fame grew, and he became a symbol of the power of collective action against institutional investors.\r\n\r\nThe Original Meme Stock\r\n\r\nGameStop (GME) \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at GameStop (GME), the original meme stock that ignited the frenzy. In early 2021, GME saw its stock price skyrocket from under $20 to nearly $500 in a matter of weeks. This surge was fueled by a massive short squeeze, where retail investors bought up shares to force short sellers to cover their positions, thereby driving the price even higher. Since that move, GameStop shares split 4-for-1. Adjusting for this split, we see January 2021 highs over $120.\r\n\r\nRecently, GME has experienced another wave of buying interest, pushing its stock back into the spotlight. The return of the famed Roaring Kitty on X, formerly known as Twitter, helped fuel the recent interest.\r\n\r\nContinued . . .\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSee ALL Zacks' Long-Term Picks for Only $1\r\n\r\nNow you can more confidently navigate the market with Zacks' private investment recommendations.

His tweet was cryptic yet characteristic, featuring a playful nod to his past videos and investment thesis on GameStop. The tweet quickly garnered thousands of likes and retweets, reflecting the lasting impact Gill has on the retail investor community.\r\n\r\nHe then followed this up with several video clips. These clips were from dozens of well-known movies like Braveheart and E.T. All of them shared a similar theme, referencing GameStop as well as the return of Roaring Kitty. In the days that followed the tweets, well-known meme stocks all came back to life.\r\n\r\nThe Impact on Market Dynamics \r\n\r\nThe meme stock craze has also had a significant impact on market dynamics. For one, it has increased market volatility, as seen in the wild price swings of stocks like AMC Entertainment (AMC), BlackBerry (BB), and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY). This heightened volatility has led to a surge in trading volumes, with retail investors accounting for a larger share of market activity.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the meme stock phenomenon has forced institutional investors to adapt their strategies. Hedge funds that were heavily shorting these stocks have faced massive losses, leading some to reevaluate their short-selling practices. On the flip side, some institutional players have started to capitalize on the meme stock movement by taking long positions in these stocks or using options to profit from the volatility.\r\n\r\nThe Regulatory Response\r\n\r\nWith the rise of meme stocks, regulators have been closely monitoring the situation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has expressed concerns about potential market manipulation and the risks posed to retail investors. In response, there have been calls for greater transparency and stricter regulations on short selling and social media-driven trading.\r\n\r\nHowever, regulating the meme stock phenomenon is no easy task. Social media platforms operate globally, making it challenging to enforce rules and monitor activity. Moreover, any attempts to curtail retail trading could be seen as favoring institutional investors, potentially undermining public trust in the financial system.\r\n\r\nThe Naked Short \r\n\r\nAt the center of the meme stock controversy has been naked short selling. Naked short selling occurs when an investor sells shares of a stock without first borrowing them or ensuring that they can be borrowed. This contrasts with traditional short selling, where the seller must borrow the shares before selling them, ensuring that the transaction can be settled.\r\n\r\nNaked short selling can lead to significant market distortions. Since the seller has not borrowed the shares, there is no limit to the number of shares they can sell short, potentially creating an artificially high supply of the stock. This can drive the stock price down, even if there is no fundamental reason for the decline.\r\n\r\nBefore the original GME surge, short interest on GME had reached above 100%, a clear indication that hedge funds had been engaging in the practice of naked short selling. The plan investors had was to buy up shares and force the hedge funds to cover their shorts, causing a short-squeeze which would take the stock higher.\r\n\r\nRegulation SHO\r\n\r\nThere are already regulations in place to mitigate naked short selling. The SEC introduced Regulation SHO to address concerns about naked short selling. This regulation includes provisions such as the \"locate\" requirement, which mandates that brokers must have reasonable grounds to believe that shares can be borrowed before executing a short sale. It also includes \"close-out\" requirements to address failures to deliver.\r\n\r\nIf a broker-dealer has a fail to deliver position in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, they are required to borrow or arrange to borrow the securities before accepting any further short sale orders in that security from any customer or effecting a short sale in that security for their own account.\r\n\r\nThere is a list published each day of stocks which have experienced failures to deliver. This is known as the Regulation SHO Threshold list. Persistent non-compliance with Rule 204(b) can result in regulatory actions from the SEC or the FINRA. These actions can include fines, censures, and other disciplinary measures. The aim of these rules and penalties is to ensure that broker-dealers settle their trades promptly and reduce the risk of persistent fails to deliver, thereby maintaining market integrity and investor confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Latest Meme Stock Madness \r\n\r\nThe knee-jerk reaction to the return of Roaring Kitty sent several meme stocks surging higher. GameStop saw its shares go from under $20 to $64.83 on Tuesday May 14th. AMC went from under $4 to $11.88. Other short-squeezes occurred in stocks like Faraday Future Intelligent Electric where shares went from 4 cents to nearly $4 in just a few days.\r\n\r\nThese meme stock investors have grown savvy. Their new targets are stocks with low floats where shorts are a large percentage of the float. Armed with Regulation SHO, they are on the hunt for the next big short squeeze to attack hedge funds with. The problem is, short-sale data is always delayed for the retail investor by two weeks making it impossible to know real-time. Also, with such a long window, 13 consecutive settlement days, before clear violations, shorts operated with virtually impunity. I have seen dozens of stocks pop up for a day or two, only for the shorts to stand on the offer and snuff out the rally.\r\n\r\nIt is important for investors to understand the risks and the odds that are stacked against them when fighting hedge funds. Simply put, institutional money has a different set of rules. Fighting them can lead to heart-breaking losses for investors. This is meant as a word to the wise. While these meme stocks can have incredible short-term payoffs when the timing is right, they are incredibly risky business.\r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nThe meme stock craze is far from over, and it continues to captivate the financial world. While the phenomenon has introduced a new level of volatility and unpredictability to the market, it has also democratized investing and empowered a new generation of retail investors.\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway for investors is to stay informed, remain adaptable, and be prepared for both the opportunities and risks that come with this new era of trading.\r\n\r\nBut if you'd rather not contend with constant uncertainty, watch for regulatory developments, and closely monitor social media trends and sentiment, there may be a better investment strategy for you.\r\n\r\nWhich Companies Are Most Likely To Produce Big Profits? \r\n\r\nToday, you have a chance to see the stocks we believe have the most promising upside for the months and years ahead.

        "content": "Meme stocks are back in the big leagues, spurred by the return of Keith Gill, known as \u2018Roaring Kitty.\u2019 Many of the original meme stock plays, like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC), which went parabolic in 2021, soared over 70%. Many would feel that renewed interest in meme stocks\u00a0to buy\u00a0echoes the 2021 frenzy when retail traders effectively reshaped markets.\n\nTo be fair, the current meme stock rally which started on Monday, has mostly fizzled out. Thus, equating the sustained impact of the original meme stock rally with the current surge misses the mark. However, the renewed enthusiasm in stocks with a strong online backing points to lucrative opportunities for savvy investors.\n\nIn this article, though, we\u2019ll be taking a different approach. The spotlight is on meme stocks to buy with real substance, drawing massive attention to Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) via the ApeWisdom tool.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech juggernaut\u00a0Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominated headlines leading up to its first-quarter (Q1) earnings print and didn\u2019t disappoint.\u00a0It delivered an eye-watering revenue of $26 billion, a 262.2% year-over-year (YOY) increase, beating estimates by $1.45 billion. Data center sales, in particular, surged 427% YOY and roughly 23% sequentially. Moreover, its non-GAAP EPS of $6.12 blew past estimates by 54 cents. Looking ahead, the firm expects to generate $28 billion in sales during the second-quarter (Q2), a 101% increase from the prior-year period.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, though, as the AI chip giant announced a massive 150% quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share.\u00a0Additionally, it announced a ten-for-one forward stock split, which would have NVDA stock trading at around $95 at current prices.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Nvidia\u2019s Q1 results provided plenty to unpack over its dominance in the AI chip market. It commands roughly 80% of the market, and its peers are merely contending for what remains. Moreover, with it expected to dish out new products like the Blackwell GPU, it would be rather foolish to bet against the stock.\n\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.\n\nSource: lentamart / Shutterstock\n\nLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a big-name retailer trading at a deep discount. LULU stock is trading roughly 42% behind its 52-week highs, buffeted by economic challenges dampening its domestic sales. Consequently, the stock trades around 4.25 times forward sales estimates, 45% higher than its 5-year average.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe athletic apparel and sneaker producer has witnessed a marked slowdown in U.S. sales, resulting in a lackluster full-year top-and-bottom-line projection. Moreover, it disclosed plans to close its Washington state distribution center while cutting 100 jobs. Despite its challenges, investors have gotten too spooked by its current woes.\n\nOn the bright side,\u00a0it beat estimates on both lines for the eighth-consecutive quarter, including its latest earnings print. Additionally, international sales jumped by 54% YOY, with sales in China alone climbing to 78%. Turning to analyst projections, Wall-Street analysts assign a \u2018moderate buy\u2019 rating to the stock, with more than a 54% upside from current prices.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood's mobile app logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. Robinhood stocks. HOOD stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of social trading platform\u00a0Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) have been on fire over the past year. HOOD stock surged more than 124% last year and an even better 139% in the past six months. A vibrant crypto rally and favorable stock market dynamics have propelled HOOD stock to multi-year highs. Moreover, given the likelihood of interest rate cuts later this year, expect more upside for HOOD stock.\n\nFurthermore, Robinhood is far from being just a one-trick pony. Though much of its success is linked to its strength in crypto markets, its expansion into other fintech verticals makes it a more comprehensive financial services provider. More specifically, it\u2019s looking to venture into retirement accounts, expand its trading options, and recently launched a Gold credit card. The card has attracted more than a million waitlist sign-ups, with a 42% YOY increase in subscribers.\n\nMoreover, following another blowout quarterly result, Bank of America Securities analyst Craig Siegenthaler upgraded HOOD stock to a \u2018buy\u2019 from \u2018underperform.\u2019 The notable double-upgrade was driven by heightened retail engagement, enhanced organic growth, and the platform\u2019s positive operational leverage following sizable cost reductions. It is one of the best meme stocks to buy, in my opinion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Is Most-Watched Stock GameStop Corp. (GME) Worth Betting on Now?",
        "content": "GameStop (GME) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this video game retailer have returned +63.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. The Zacks Retail - Consumer Electronics industry, to which GameStop belongs, has gained 6.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, GameStop is expected to post a loss of $0.10 per share, indicating a change of +28.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.01 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -83.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.09 indicates a change of +800% from what GameStop is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, GameStop is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GME _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of GameStop, the consensus sales estimate of $900 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -27.3%. The $4.5 billion and $4.15 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.7% and -7.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nGameStop reported revenues of $1.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.4%. EPS of $0.22 for the same period compares with $0.16 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -10.32%. The EPS surprise was -12%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, GameStop surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nGameStop is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about GameStop. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024",
        "content": "It is the unofficial kickoff to summer this weekend. Millions of Americans are expected to hit the road and fly the skies to enjoy warmer weather and get a break from the grind. We've seen just how popular many forms of in-person entertainment have been in the past year, so there's reason for optimism on the consumption front.\n\nRecall that about a year ago, the \"Taylor Swift Effect\" drove improved economic growth in certain regions (no joke, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said as much), and strong ratings and ticket sales have been seen for other artists and in live sports.[1] It doesn't hurt that, as of this writing, a pair of New York professional sports teams are making playoff runs too.\n\nBut not all entertainment venues have been welcoming boisterous crowds. So far in 2024, domestic gross box office sales are down 24% from year-ago levels through May 15, according to IMDbPro.[2] It comes as Hollywood struggles to put out popular blockbusters and as continued drama in the media-enterprise space casts a dark cloud over out-of-the-house entertainment.\n\nWeaker box office sales in 2024 Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro\n\nBundle-unbundle-rebundle\n\nInvestors and casual observers alike have surely read and heard about the ongoing drama at Disney (NYSE:DIS). All the while, families across the country have been forced to consider the steeply rising costs of subscription streaming services. Maybe just as frustrating for consumers, it seems the movies and entertainment industry is now pivoting from an a la carte sales model back to bundling, which has features of the old-school cable package.\n\nCorporate activity\n\nThere has been no break in the action this year with so many moving pieces and a reshuffling of the media playing field. It was just a handful of months ago when Lionsgate Studio spun off from Starz. The new entity, Lionsgate Studios Corp. (LFG.A), focuses on film and TV. Then in May, shares of Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) fell on a report that Sony was rethinking its $26 billion bid for the company.[3] The latest whisper is that Paramount and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may partner up.[4]\n\nNetflix pounces on new opportunities\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), meanwhile, continues to venture further into sports, inking a three-year deal with the NFL to stream a set of games each season.[5] It also plans to launch an in-house advertising technology platform to further diversify its revenue sources.[6] The Communication Services stalwart may not be grouped with the Magnificent Seven heavyweights, but shares are up more than 25% in 2024.[7] Boasting a highly profitable ad-supported tier, with a total subscriber base of 40 million customers, up five million from a year ago, consumers just keep chillin'.[8]\n\nStory continues\n\n2021 social media favorites come roaring back\n\nAnd how can we not offer a nod to meme-stock mania Part III? Shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) have gone bananas in recent weeks, all prompted by a single picture posted to X by @TheRoaringKitty earlier this month.[9] Of course, the social-trading frenzy has little to do with fundamentals in the movie market, but the saga is worthy of sitting back with a bowl of popcorn and seeing what unfolds.\n\nFeature films\n\nBut let's aim the spotlight at the movie scene as the summer months inch closer. Our data show that, as has become the norm, Netflix dominates the movie-release count from mid-May through the Labor Day weekend. Nineteen major motion pictures are slated to be released. Sony Pictures Studios is runner-up with 13 movies set to hit the domestic box office. Disney and Lionsgate also have several high-profile films in the cue.\n\nMajor movie release count through Labor Day weekend Summer Cinema Crunch: Box Office Sales Off to a Slow Start in 2024\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nConferences and shareholder meetings on tap\n\nOn the event watch, following the JP Morgan 52nd Annual TMT Global Technology Media and Communications Conference this week, be on the lookout for potential volatility in the media space on May 30 when the Bernstein 40th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference (SDC) begins. Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), Paramount Global, AMC and Netflix each hold annual shareholder meetings during the first full week of June. All eyes will then be on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when it holds its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\n\nGrab your popcorn What to watch this summer\n\nAs for the box office, much depends on how the summer lineup performs. Here are the key motion pictures that analysts will watch closely and movie-goers can look forward to:\n\nMay 24: The Garfield Movie, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, AtlasJune 7: The CrowJune 14: Inside Out 2, Bad Boys 4June 21: The BikeridersJune 28: A Quiet Place: Day One, Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 1)July 3: Despicable Me 4July 5: MaXXXineJuly 12: LonglegsJuly 19: TwistersJuly 26: Deadpool & WolverineAugust 9: BorderlandsAugust 16: Horizon: An American Saga (Chapter 2), Alien: RomulusAugust 30: Kraven the HunterSeptember 6: Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere's been more drama and action scenes in movie stocks than on the big screen so far in 2024. The media space continues to go through shakeups both in the boardroom and with broad strategies. All the while, consumers may be growing increasingly frustrated with TV options, but data suggests fewer folks are flocking to theaters for entertainment. All eyes will now be on Hollywood's summer lineup.\n\n1 Summary of Economic Activity, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, June 2023, https://www.philadelphiafed.org2 Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro, May 22, 2024, https://www.boxofficemojo.com/3 Paramount shares fall after CNBC reports Sony rethinking its bid, Reuters, May 14, 2024, https://www.reuters.com4 Paramount Holds Talks With Amazon About Expanded Partnership, Bloomberg, Thomas Buckley, Lucas Shaw, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com5 Netflix Nears Deal for NFL Games, Extending Push Into Sports, Bloomberg, Lucas Shaw, Randall Williams, May 15, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com6 Netflix To Launch In-House Advertising Tech Platform, Next TV, Jon Lafayette, May 15, 2024, https://www.nexttv.com7 NFLX, Stockcharts, May 17, 2024, http://stockcharts.com8 Netflix hits 40 million users for ad-supported plan, Reuters, May 16, 2024, https://www.reuters.com9 TheRoaringKitty, X, May 12, 2024, https://x.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 22, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase COIN, Robinhood Markets HOOD, Reddit RDDT, GameStop GME MicroStrategy MSTR.\n\nTap Into Bitcoin's Bull Market with These 3 Crypto Stocks\n\nBitcoin is the best performing asset over the past decade, and its performance has shown little signs of letting up -- and some top crypto stocks are on a tear, too.\n\nYear-to-date, the world\u2019s first and largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 60%, gaining almost 150% over the past twelve months. Despite regulatory hurdles, crypto exchange closures, and a brutal bear market, Bitcoin has climbed the proverbial \u201cWall of Worry\u201d and is only a few thousand off its all-time high of $73,798.\n\nLooking ahead to the second-half of 2024, Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies should benefit from two major bullish catalysts, including:\n\nThe Bitcoin Halving Fuels Record Gains\n\nThe Bitcoin \u201cHalving\u201d event occurs every four years and cuts the number of newly \u201cminted\u201d Bitcoin in half. Bitcoin\u2019s unique monetary policy separates it from central bank-issued currencies and makes it an attractive investment for so many. While central banks have no limit on how much they can inflate their currency, Bitcoin\u2019s supply is limited. Historical price moves illustrate the benefits of the halving. The first three halvings produced gains of 9,133%, 281%, and 562% one year later!\n\nInstitutional Adoption Grows with Bitcoin ETFs\n\nA 13F is a disclosure required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that companies with assets under management north of $100 million must present. This quarter, more than 600 institutions disclosed positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs, including a who\u2019s who of top-tier firms.\n\n3 Crypto-Related Stocks to Buy Now\n\nCoinbase\n\nCoinbase is the most prominent crypto exchange in the U.S., earning a best-possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) score.\n\nCash Cow\n\nSeth Klarman is a legendary value investor, billionaire, and one of the highest-earning money managers in the world. In an interview last year, Klarman stated that he avoids crypto but sees value in Coinbase, saying, \u201cCoinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things.\u201d Well, now that number has grown to more than 7 billion. I bring this to your attention because not many people trading a stock like COIN probably understand how sound the company is fundamentally.\n\nCoinbase Smashing the Street\u2019s Expectations\n\nOn May 3rd, the leading crypto exchange announced EPS of $4.4, smashing the Street\u2019s estimate of $1.07.Here is a snippet of the EPS transcript that stuck out to me:\u201cOur financial performance in Q1 reflects our focused execution on product expansion, ongoing operational discipline, and strong crypto market conditions. We generated $1.6 billion of total revenue and $1.2 billion of net income*. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 billion \u2013 more than we generated in all of 2023.\u201d Lastly, we continue to drive regulatory clarity for crypto through grassroots advocacy, pushing for legislation, and ongoing efforts to seek clarity through the courts.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nCOIN has beaten expectations for five straight quarters, and not only are they beating them, they are smashing them. Over the past five quarters the average EPS surprise is 364.63%!\n\nRobinhood Markets\n\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stockRobinhood is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to \u201cdemocratize\u201d trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platform Reddit and included meteoric moves in stocks like GameStop.\n\nBull Catalyst: Crypto\n\nHOOD recently added crypto-enabled trading. Though HOOD is late to the crypto game, the company has the perfect client base to take advantage of a Bitcoin bull market.\n\nConsistent Positive EPS Surprises\n\nHOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!\n\nRecord Net Deposits\n\nNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, CEO Vlad Tenev announced on May 14th that Robinhood hit $5B in equities trading volume.\n\nRobinhood Gold Is Growing\n\nRobinhood recently announced a new \u201cGold\u201d credit card. HOOD has already gained a healthy 260,000 new subscribers.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nMicroStrategy has been around for years and is a leading provider of business intelligence software.\n\nAdopting the Bitcoin Standard\n\nFormer CEO and billionaire Michael Saylor made waves on Wall Street a few years ago when he got MSTR on the \u201cBitcoin Standard.\u201d Instead of sitting in inflationary assets like U.S. dollars, Saylor realized MSTR would be better off on a \u201cBitcoin sail.\u201d Essentially, MSTR is a leveraged Bitcoin bet. The results speak for themselves \u2013 over the past five years, MicroStrategy is up more than 1,000%!\n\nConversely, a good option for investors who do not want a leveraged bet but want to tap into Bitcoin\u2019s potential upside is the IBIT ETF. IBIT has some of the lowest fees and the most liquidity out of all the Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "While everyone is talking about AMC (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME), the real story is copper. And if you haven\u2019t noticed, copper prices are currently shooting for the moon.\n\nCopper \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/kWahylTpPH\n\n\u2014 Michael A. Gayed, CFA (@leadlagreport) May 17, 2024\n\nOne of the biggest investment themes I have been following is the potential for China\u2019s economy to start showing signs of life. It\u2019s happening. Those markets have been on a tear, and the Chinese government is finally starting to take action.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter a prolonged bear market in the country\u2019s property sector, China is now taking some decisive steps to stabilize prices. Whether or not it will be successful is unclear, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\n\nI think the move in copper is partially based on that. As the largest importer of copper, China\u2019s economic policies and initiatives, such as the issuance of 1 trillion yuan in ultra-long bonds for infrastructure, have a substantial impact on copper prices and demand. Projections indicate that annual global copper demand will rise to 36.6 million metric tons by 2031, up from 25.3 million in 2021, with China playing a pivotal role in this increase due to its strategic investments and consumption patterns. A resurgent China means resurgent copper.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than China. It\u2019s also AI.\n\nAI and China Are Taking Copper Prices Higher\n\nThe rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence has significantly increased the demand for copper, primarily due to its extensive use in data centers. These data centers, essential for cloud computing, big data processing, and AI algorithms, require substantial amounts of copper for electrical wiring and infrastructure. Bank of America notes that the growing need for AI capabilities has shifted focus toward copper usage in data center buildouts, which has contributed to the recent rise in copper prices. This surge in demand for copper in AI data centers is a key factor driving the overall increase in global copper consumption. And that won\u2019t go away any time soon.\n\nWhat about new supply? Good luck. Mining new copper and bringing it to market is a complex and challenging process due to several factors.\n\nFirstly, the depletion of high-grade copper ores has necessitated mining lower-grade deposits, which are more costly and less efficient to extract. Additionally, environmental regulations and community opposition often delay or halt new mining projects. The capital-intensive nature of developing new mines, which can take over a decade from discovery to production, further complicates the process. Lastly, geopolitical risks and fluctuating market prices add layers of uncertainty, making the availability of new copper to the market a formidable challenge.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rally in copper prices looks real, as does the demand. The supply constraints are also real, however. And it could get really interesting really soon.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Gayed did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK Invest funds were unstoppable in 2020 as investors piled into disruptive innovation stocks during the low-rate lockdown environment. After peaking in early 2021, the ARK funds \u2014 most notably the ARK Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) \u2014 went on a multi-year decline, eventually bottoming out at the tail end of 2022.\n\nToday, the technology sector bull market is alive and well, thanks in part to the generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) rush and hopes for future Fed rate cuts. Despite tech\u2019s momentum, ARKK has seen relatively muted performance, now up just 12% in the past year and actually down 10% year to date.\n\nOnly time will tell if the \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d theme will play catch up with the rest of the sector once the Fed readies to cut rates. Either way, Cathie Wood stocks seem worth checking in on here should the tech rally begin to reward some riskier, disruptive innovators who aren\u2019t yet making a profit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWho knows? Perhaps a few rate cuts could be enough to help Cathie Wood\u2019s disruptive-focused thematic investment style make a comeback. Here are three of my favorite Cathie Wood stocks to buy.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NASDAQ:PATH) is an automation software developer that aims to tackle repetitive everyday tasks in the workplace. Now that shares have come back to Earth, UiPath is arguably one of the most intriguing gen AI plays in the entire ARKK.\n\nAt writing, PATH stock is down around 75% from its 2021 peak, which may make it an intriguing value proposition for hyper-growth investors seeking underrated AI upside but not mind the firm\u2019s lack of profits.\n\nToday, PATH stock goes for 8.8 times price-to-sales (P/S), which isn\u2019t all too high given the magnitude of growth behind its automation platform. As UiPath improves its automation capabilities with gen AI while rates potentially take a few backward steps, I certainly wouldn\u2019t bet against the firm.\n\nThe company\u2019s expanded partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google Cloud is also a compelling development that investors should monitor.\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Roaring Kitty coming out of hibernation after around three years with posts on X (formerly Twitter), it should come as no surprise to see the action in the 2021-era meme stocks picking up once again. Indeed, the \u201cbig money\u201d meme stock short-sellers who didn\u2019t learn their lesson in 2021 have been feeling the squeeze once again.\n\nThe initial boom in shares of Gamestop (NYSE:GME) and AMCEntertainment (NYSE:AMC) have since gone bust in a big way, less than a week since Roaring Kitty\u2019s return. Still, it\u2019s a terrible idea to short either GME or AMC stock as they reverse course. Both meme stocks could easily rocket or implode tomorrow, potentially by high double-digit percentage points. Either way, Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) is enjoying the pick-up in trading activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the meme stock frenzy and soaring stock market win the love of the retail crowd again, Robinhood stands to gain. Recently, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Craig Siegenthaler double-upgraded HOOD stock, citing \u201cthe emergence of a new bull market\u201d and \u201crebounding retail engagement benefits.\u201d He\u2019s right. Roaring Kitty\u2019s return could certainly amplify the latter catalyst.\n\nModerna (MRNA) Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology innovator Cathie Wood has steadily added to in recent years. Undoubtedly, many investors have been throwing in the towel on MRNA stock as COVID-19 vaccine sales dwindled.\n\nCathie Wood\u2019s contrarian buy of the vaccine maker is intriguing, especially as the company continues advancing many promising potentials through trials. Despite the recent FDA delay in its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, I still view Moderna as still one of the most innovative companies in the biotech scene. However, it could take a few more quarters for most other investors to get truly excited about the growth potential of next-generation mRNA treatments.\n\nWith the stock gaining more than 100% from its November 2023 lows, perhaps it\u2019s time that growth investors had followed Wood\u2019s lead. For growth-hungry investors like Wood, willing to ride out the volatility while focusing on the long-term narrative, it makes sense to pursue Moderna now that it\u2019s gaining traction again. Perhaps the RSV vaccine could be the next big thing to be excited about.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Alphabet (Class C).

        "title": "GameStop Stock Analysis: Let\u2019s Not Do 2021 Again, Please",
        "content": "Video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME), along with global movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and a handful of other companies, are the talk of Wall Street again. It feels like 2021 all over again, but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing for sensible investors.\u00a0After delving into\u00a0the company\u2019s financial facts, you\u2019ll hopefully be convinced to stay away from GameStop stock.\n\nIf you\u2019re a day trader who flips GameStop\u00a0shares for a quick buck, that\u2019s a different story entirely. My message is for serious, sensible investors. Seeking multibagger gains with meme stocks is a dangerous pursuit, and getting caught up in the GameStop hype could cost you a lot of your hard-earned money.\n\nWhat Goes Up Too Fast, Must Come Down\n\nIn case you missed it, GameStop stock catapulted from $18 to $64 in a few days during the middle of May. This occurred after meme-stock celebrity \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d resurfaced on social media for the first time in several years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s basically a replay of what took place in 2021 during the height of the meme-stock frenzy. Back then, investors who held on to their GameStop shares for too long were punished in 2022, 2023 and early 2024.\n\nIn other words, you had to have great luck and timing to profit from that trade. The same thing could be said about this year\u2019s meme-stock cycle. It\u2019s following the 2021 playbook, as GameStop stock quickly dropped in the second half of May after rallying during the first half of the month.\n\nI\u2019d like to echo the wary sentiment of financial analyst and YouTuber Kevin Paffrath. He warned that buying meme stocks is \u201csort of like playing the lottery.\u201d I agree, except I would replace \u201csort of\u201d with \u201ccompletely.\u201d\n\nA Reality Check for GameStop Investors\n\nThe post-rally drop in GameStop stock picked up speed on May 17, and there was a specific reason for this. On that morning, GameStop released its preliminary results for the first fiscal quarter, which ended on May 4, 2024.\n\nThere were a couple of major pain points in the preliminary results. First of all, GameStop\u00a0expects quarterly sales of $872 million to $892 million. This represents a steep year-over-year decline when compared to $1.237 billion in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nGameStop expects to report quarterly cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.073 billion to $1.093 billion. That range is markedly lower than the $1.31 billion that GameStop recorded at the end of the year-earlier quarter.\n\nAlong with all of that, GameStop\u00a0prepared investors for an unprofitable first fiscal quarter. It\u2019s yet another reminder that short-squeeze targets like GameStop aren\u2019t always in great financial condition.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop Stock: Don\u2019t Play This Lottery\n\nPaffrath\u2019s lottery analogy might sound harsh, but it\u2019s entirely appropriate. Investing in GameStop, as opposed to day-trading the shares, is akin to gambling. In 2024, as in 2021, you\u2019ll need great luck and timing to achieve multibagger returns.\n\nBefore you take on too much risk, be sure to review GameStop\u2019s financials. I hope that you\u2019ll be persuaded to stay away from GameStop stock right now. It may be tempting to jump on the bandwagon, but the best policy is to just avoid the meme-stock lottery altogether.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The meme-stock rally of 2024 was, for the most part, very short-lived. Moreover, most of the meme stocks became stocks to sell by quickly retreated to points not far above their pre-rally levels. A few factors, in my opinion, caused the surge to last such a short time and largely dissipate so quickly. First, retail investors lack the huge amount of excess cash that they had in the second half of 2020 and 2021. Secondly, it\u2019s likely that short sellers learned from the meme stock rally of several years ago and subsequently developed strategies for dealing with it.\n\nAnd finally, many Wall Street analysts declared that the meme stock rally was entirely unjustified. For example, Morningstar noted that Trading.biz analyst Cory Mitchell had declared that the rally of AMC stock was pure hype. And CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer quickly warned investors to sell meme stocks. Indeed, most meme stocks are still tremendously overvalued and have very poor fundamentals. Here are three meme stocks to sell now.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nPerhaps contributing to the termination of the meme-stock frenzy, GameStop (NYSE:GME) announced on May 17 that it would sell 45 million shares of GME stock. Even more discouraging for the owners of its shares, the struggling video-game retailer disclosed that it estimates its top-line tumbled 29% in Q1 2024 year-over-year. The statistic indicates that the company\u2019s business is rapidly shrinking and heading for major problems.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company stated that the rally of its shares does not appear to be based on its underlying fundamentals. In other words, GameStop does not have a tremendous amount of confidence in its outlook.\n\nEven after its recent, large pullback, GME stock is changing hands at a huge enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 234 times.\n\nGiven all of these points, GameStop is definitely in the category of meme stocks to sell.\n\nFaraday Future (FFIE) In this photo illustration, the Faraday Future logo is displayed on a smartphone screen. FFIR stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric-vehicle maker Faraday Future (NASDAQ:FFIE) was founded way back in 2014 but did not make its first deliveries until Q3 2023. Moreover, the automaker, whose EV, the FF 91 2.0 Futurist, costs a dizzying $309,000, had reportedly only sold ten vehicles as of January 2024.\n\nFurther, an open letter from Faraday\u2019s CEO, released in February, included no concrete indications that the firm had obtained a significant number of orders for the future. Nor did the letter include a clear strategy for obtaining orders.\n\nImpressively, the company claims their EV is is faster than Lamborghini Urus, and has a range of 381 miles. It also has the ability to run many apps, including ChatGPT.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, the company only had cash of $6.7 million and debt of $135 million as of September 2023. That, along with its low revenue, makes FFIE a very dangerous bet at this point.\n\nAMC (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJim Cramer correctly pointed out that AMC (NYSE:AMC) may become insolvent in 2026 when it will owe a huge $2 billion.\n\nI believe that if AMC doesn\u2019t go under by that year, it will probably have to sell a gargantuan number of shares. Those massive share sales, in turn, will cause the stock\u2019s value to plummet way below its current value.\n\nAlso not boding well for AMC\u2019s outlook, attendance at its U.S. theaters sank 5.8% last quarter YOY. Meanwhile, its operations burned $268 million of cash in the 12 months that ended in March. The decline in the company\u2019s U.S. attendance indicates that the popularity of movie theaters is once again headed downwards.\n\nDespite all of these huge issues, the shares are changing hands at a relatively high enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 21.8 times.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Stocks, Gold Reach New Record Highs, Cruise Stocks Rally, GameStop Sinks: What's Driving Markets Monday?\n\nWall Street kicked off the new week on a high note, with all major U.S. indices posting gains and reaching fresh record highs by midday trading in New York, as the bull market momentum remains strong.\n\nThe S&P 500 index surged to 5,325 points during the session, matching last Thursday\u2019s all-time high.

Silver increased by 1.3% after a 6.4% gain on Friday, up more than 20% since the beginning of the month.\n\nTreasury yields saw little movement, with the 10-year benchmark hovering at 4.44%. Markets appeared to brush off some hawkish remarks from the Federal Reserve.\n\nFederal Reserve Vice President Michael Barr noted that first-quarter inflation was disappointing and did not provide the confidence needed to ease monetary policy, emphasizing the necessity of allowing tight policy more time to work. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly expressed that she is not yet confident inflation is sustainably decreasing to 2%. In a softer tone, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson highlighted that the policy is in restrictive territory and that he is cautiously optimistic about continuing the fight against inflation while keeping the economy strong.\n\nAmong industries, cruise stocks rallied substantially after Norwegian Cruise Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH) raised its earnings guidance for the year, boosting shares by over 8%. Peers such as Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) saw gains of 7.4% and 5.4%, respectively.\n\nSentiment on meme stocks continued to wane, with GameStop Corp.

        "content": "As inflation remains increasingly sticky, finding undervalued stocks to buy has become increasingly difficult. Meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) continue climbing despite rapidly approaching market saturation, which could leave retail traders holding the bag when the music stops.\n\nEven if inflation cools consistently, goods and services remain significantly higher than two years ago. This discrepancy arises because inflation measures ongoing price growth rather than actual price levels, resulting in persistently low consumer confidence despite inflation rate trends. So, we\u2019re looking at a spiraling situation in which companies pull profit from higher pricing rather than internal optimization, which seems destined for correction.\n\nThe bottom line is that meme stocks are back on the menu, and tech stocks are becoming prohibitively expensive for the average retail investor. Both conditions make undervalued stocks an attractive option in today\u2019s market. Affordably priced, these stocks offer an opportunity for investors to accumulate shares at reasonable prices. These undervalued stocks to buy are poised for rapid growth due to favorable circumstances and bullish momentum, laying the groundwork for their future success.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) saw a per-share pricing dip in recent weeks, but it\u2019s tough to discern why. The losses appear to result from general inattention and cooling sentiment after a stellar earnings report initially sent shares soaring. Although this might not represent a true dip, the stock is down enough to be worth buying before the next potential surge.\n\nThat upward movement could happen sooner than expected, given some unusual options activity suggesting hefty expectations for the stock within the next month. While options flow isn\u2019t always definitive, a purchase order for 17,000 call options expiring on May 17th with a price target of $26.50 is certainly notable.\n\nHistorically, Palantir\u2019s stock has traded within a tight range before surging and settling at or near a new floor. For a long time, that floor hovered around $15. Strong earnings pushed the per-share price to $25 before it settled into today\u2019s lower limit of approximately $20. If the company\u2019s earnings trajectory continues, this may be one of the last opportunities to buy Palantir at its relatively undervalued pricing.\n\nTitan Machinery (TITN) Image of the foundation and frame of a house\n\nSmall-cap agriculture and construction equipment value stocks like Titan Machinery (NASDAQ:TITN) might not enjoy the same level of recognition as larger counterparts like Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), but Titan\u2019s robust fundamentals speak volumes. Titan Machinery recently released its fourth-quarter and year-end reports, surpassing expectations with a 25% annual sales increase and nearly a 10% rise in yearly earnings despite rising supply chain and fuel costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these strong fundamentals, Titan Machinery is undeniably undervalued, trading at just 0.19x sales, 4.8x earnings and 0.80x book value. This undervaluation is particularly stark given the company\u2019s 79% income growth over three years. With a conservative outlook for 2025, projecting single-digit gains across its segments and a slight dip in year-end earnings, surpassing these modest forecasts could lead to a surge in Titan\u2019s stock value. At current prices, this small-cap value stock is an easy buy.\n\nCricut (CRCT) Image of a person doing crafts on a table.\n\nSource: CRAFT24/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe do-it-yourself set may love Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT), but the undervalued stock doesn\u2019t get nearly the investor attention it deserves. Although revenue dipped slightly in its most recent earnings report, net income climbed 116% year-over-year, boosted by a 54.7% gross margin expansion. Cricut benefits from improving consumer sentiment, especially as buyers look for stay-at-home activities to save money and manage household budgets.\n\nIn 2024\u2019s first quarter, overall sales dropped 8%, offset by higher paid subscriber rates and increased machine sales. This means more people kickstarted their Cricut journey in recent months, and investors can expect a corresponding sales boost as new users restock and replenish crafting supplies.\n\nNow is the time to consider buying into this undervalued stock, as management announced a special one-time dividend of $0.40 in the earnings report. Shareholders of record on July 2nd will receive the distribution on July 19th, so there\u2019s still time to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nMedifast (MED) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nMedifast (NYSE:MED) hasn\u2019t yet caught the wider weight loss wave affecting many pharma stocks. Still, there is long-term potential for this nutrition and weight loss company to expand its product sales across various platforms, including multi-level marketing.\n\nMedifast reported a solid $0.76 earnings per share in the first quarter. The company\u2019s balance sheet is strong, boasting a $150 million cash reserve with zero debt, which is crucial in today\u2019s high-rate environment. Additionally, executives are striving to differentiate Medifast from larger weight loss competitors.\n\nManagement is shifting toward a more comprehensive and holistic approach to customer management, including guided habit development and personalized coaching. Earnings statements indicate that \u201c2024 will be a year of investment for future growth.\u201d While this may impact the sustainability of today\u2019s 20% dividend yield, it does not diminish the undervalued stock\u2019s long-term upside potential.\n\nGarrett Motion (GTX)\n\nSource: Nvidia\n\nGarrett Motion (NASDAQ:GTX) may be the most objectively undervalued stock on this list, trading at just 7x earnings and 0.5x sales while remaining an overlooked player in the green tech and sustainable driving sector. The company manufactures various automotive parts that enhance emission reductions and support zero-emission technologies, including alternative fuel engines and turbochargers for gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nWhile pure EV plays like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are currently losing favor due to declining consumer interest, evidenced by the surge in hybrid and gasoline vehicle sales, Garrett Motion provides a bridge for investors seeking long-term sustainability while acknowledging that global EV adoption is a long-term goal.\n\nThe recent dip in Garrett Motion\u2019s stock followed an earnings report showing a 6% drop in quarterly sales; however, its annual sales remained stable, and the company maintained healthy margins and free cash flow. This stock is underappreciated and undervalued as investors chase more prominent growth opportunities. As automakers revise their EV planning timelines, expect Garrett Motion to become a major small-cap value stock in the future market.\n\nGigaCloud Technology (GCT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGlobalized, direct-to-consumer eCommerce continues to soar in popularity, as demonstrated by giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ:GCT), a lesser-known but rising eCommerce force, targets the massive B2B market by creating a comprehensive platform for businesses to source products and manage all associated logistics.\n\nMedium-sized businesses often struggle with product and inventory management, sourcing and payment processing. GigaCloud addresses these challenges by providing a complete suite of scaled B2B eCommerce solutions, including an active vendor marketplace, shipment and freight management, warehouse storage, AI-powered fulfillment and secure cross-border payment processing.\n\nGigaCloud\u2019s financial metrics are particularly impressive. With a low price-to-earnings ratio of just 13.9 \u2014 well below the tech sector average of 36x \u2014 the undervalued stock doubled its earnings per share over the last few quarters and has robust free cash flow despite trading at (relatively) bottom-barrel pricing.\n\nSirius XM Holdings (SIRI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of US broadcasting company Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen Warren Buffett vouches for a stock, pay attention. This focus makes Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ:SIRI) stand out as a remarkable choice among undervalued stocks, especially given the billionaire\u2019s investment. Even as Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) appeared more inclined toward selling than buying, his $167 million investment in Sirius XM signals a positive indicator for value investors. Given the wider market skepticism, it\u2019s an even more noteworthy play. Sirius XM remains one of the most heavily shorted stocks today at 21% short interest. So why is Buffett optimistic about this stock?\n\nBuffett\u2019s interest in Sirius XM goes beyond planned corporate realignment; he views it as a top-notch value investment. Despite trading at low multiples, Sirius XM has a promising future. The company is a cash-generating powerhouse, with EBITDA margins exceeding 30% for the last four years and maintaining a free cash flow of over $1 billion. Additionally, Sirius XM offers a solid dividend yield of 4.69% with a payout ratio of 31%, demonstrating efficient cash management by its leadership in rewarding shareholders while strategically adjusting its market presence.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Ignore GME and AMC: Faraday Future Is the Meme Stock to Watch",
        "content": "On May 12, 2024, the internet cheered as the man credited with launching the GameStop (NYSE:GME) short squeeze of 2021 returned to social media. Keith Gill, better known by the online alias \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d randomly shared a drawing of a gamer on X after a multi-year hiatus from the platform. The post did not have much context, but it quickly sparked a meme stock trading frenzy, sending favorites such as GME and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) into the green.\n\nA week later, the meme stock rally has died off, but some lesser-known companies are still rising. If we assess this by progress alone, the winner of the Roaring Kitty rally isn\u2019t GameStop or AMC. It\u2019s Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NYSE:FFIE), an electric vehicle (EV) producer that many investors have written off. But FFIE stock has been rising all week, and despite some dips, it has surged by truly impressive amounts.\n\nKeep an Eye on FFIE Stock\n\nIn an era when seemingly random companies can surge on unexpected meme stock momentum, whenever a new one arises, it\u2019s best to approach with caution. For all the excitement that erupts when a failing, heavily shorted company starts to surge, the momentum rarely lasts, as the Roaring Kitty rally recently reminded investors. This week, GME stock is back in the red, and AMC is struggling to stay in the green. But FFIE stock is still surging. Even with some volatility, it is up more than 45% for the day.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good day for any stock, and it\u2019s only half over. But to really highlight the difference between this new meme stock and the old r/WallStreetBets favorites, let\u2019s take a look at their performances over the past five days. Despite the many retail investors who pounded the table over a short squeeze early last week, GME and AMC are down 70% and 62%, respectively, for the past five days. But Faraday Future is up almost 1,300% for the same period. Talk about a stark contrast.\n\nIt\u2019s true that FFIE stock still trades at only $1.40 per share. But when we consider the fact that it began May 2024 trading at $0.050, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by this performance. While most other meme stocks were running out of momentum last week, Faraday Future kept climbing, beating the inevitable meme stock slump. Now we\u2019re in a new week and it still shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nHow high can FFIE stock go? At this point, it\u2019s difficult to predict precisely how much room to run it has. But now the momentum from the Roaring Kitty rally has died down, and this new meme stock is still rising. That suggests that Faraday Future may have growth potential beyond the short squeeze. And despite all its growth, it still trades at a low enough price point that many investors may see it as being worth a gamble simply based on its recent performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, unlike GameStop and AMC, Faraday doesn\u2019t operate in a dying industry. As The Economist reports, the only future for the movie theater industry lies in creating a more luxurious experience for consumers. That means a bright future for a company like IMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX) but a bleak one for AMC, a company in which even retail investors are losing interest. And GameStop, at its core, is still only a plastic disc retail operating in a troubled industry that is becoming hard to navigate. But the EV market is primed for a rebound, which could help take FFIE stock higher in the coming months.\n\nMost meme stocks have no real growth potential and only rise when a flash-in-the-pan rally strikes. But in the case of FFIE, investors may actually have a struggling company that is worth resurrecting.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "title": "Crypto Tokenization May Change the World in 2024",
        "content": "When it comes to cryptocurrencies, a lot of folks don\u2019t quite understand the hype. It seems like this realm of \u2018internet money\u2019 cropped up overnight, and it\u2019s maintained its place in the spotlight ever since.\n\nBut did you know that cryptocurrencies were intended to be a hedge against economic meltdown? It all began back in 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in response to the 2008 financial crisis. And now about 15 years later, the global market value of cryptocurrencies has surged to over $2 trillion. That\u2019s an astonishing level of wealth creation.\n\nYet many people are still left wondering: What do cryptos actually do? It\u2019s a simple question. But the answer you\u2019ll get will depend on who and when you ask it. Though, for me, it all boils down to one word: Tokenization.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat Is Tokenization?\n\nIn the context of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, tokenization refers to the process of converting a physical asset or ownership rights into a digital token. This allows assets to be traded, transferred, and managed more efficiently and securely.\n\nIn other words, a physical asset is broken down into tradeable ownership \u201ctokens,\u201d creating a liquid market around any asset.\n\nTake a luxury collectible car. Traditionally, it\u2019s owned by just one person. But\u2026 if you were to tokenize that car\u2026 and split the ownership rights up into say, a dozen different tokens\u2026 then a dozen different people could each own 1/12 of that car\u2026 and trade that value to other folks as a medium of exchange.\n\nThe same could go for a house, a trading card, or anything of real-world value.\n\nEssentially, tokenization allows people to create a market out of anything.\n\nAnd interestingly, this past week, Blockworks tech journalist Mike Mallazzo wrote:\n\n\u201cMore than ever before, crypto is unabashedly embracing its most reductionist and obvious purpose \u2013 turning everything into a game where you can seamlessly buy low and sell high.\u201d\n\nWe entirely agree with that statement.\n\nTo us, the best real-world crypto use case is the tokenization of physical assets to essentially \u201cgamify\u201d anything \u2013 or perhaps more appropriately, create a liquid market of value around anything.\n\nAn Era of Gamification\n\nAnd we believe the timing for this use case to show its true value couldn\u2019t be better \u2013 because consumers are increasingly gamifying everything these days.\n\nLook no further than the meme stock craze comeback of the past week. GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) both shot up hundreds of percent in a matter of days all because a famous trader tweeted about them.\n\nStory continues\n\nFolks are out there buying GameStop and AMC hoping to strike it rich. It\u2019s become a betting game.\u00a0Or how about sports betting? That is absolutely surging these days. Indeed, in 2023, Americans wagered a record $120 billion on sports bets. That\u2019s up nearly 30% year-over-year.\n\nAnd now Dave & Buster\u2019s (PLAY) is getting into betting, too. The arcade operator is teaming up with gamification technology company Lucra to allow customers to make small bets on arcade games through D&B\u2019s app.\n\nD&B sees the writing on the wall. Americans are obsessed with gamification. The demand is there. But the mechanisms are not.\n\nThe Final Word on Cryptos and Tokenization\n\nThe existence of middlemen in the gamification process is a massive shortcoming.\n\nAfter all, why place a $5 bet through an app \u2013 and let the app take a hefty cut \u2013 when you could just Venmo that bet without fees instead?\n\nYes, Americans want to create a market or a game out of anything. But not at any cost.\n\nThe blockchain addresses this shortcoming by replacing profit-taking middlemen with free technology.\n\nThat\u2019s why we think tokenization is the most profound real-world application of cryptos.\n\nWith it, cryptos will enable us to create a game out of anything.

        "content": "GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC (NYSE:AMC) meme stocks rose substantially last week, gaining over 70%. The return of \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019, prominent investor Keith Gill, has traders wondering which meme stocks to buy next. After three years away from publicity, the trading crowd seems to be hyped up again.\r\n\r\nMarkets have more experience in sharply moving meme stocks now due to retail traders\u2019 participation in coordinating on social media in 2021. Hedge funds are more cautious of unconventional short squeezes, while the financial press is better at identifying surges in social media activity. The market is simply more mature in its understanding of meme stock mania. Despite offering potential stability, price volatility in some stocks remains possible in response to retail traders or social media interest.\r\n\r\nConsequently, savvy traders seek meme stocks to buy whose shares could experience large price moves. Here are three stock picks to pounce on now to get ahead of the curve:\n\nNovavax (NVAX) Concept of NVAX stock vaccine against COVID-19. Glass medical vials with liquid. Ampoules with coronavirus vaccine on a medical glass table\n\nSource: vovidzha / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn interesting stock pick in this list of meme stocks to buy is vaccine development company Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). Just a week ago, the NVAX share price nearly doubled with a 2,000x surge in volumes after Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announced a $1.2 billion investment in the company. The Novavax market cap before the announcement was just $1.69 billion. Sanofi is interested in Novavax\u2019s Coronavirus vaccine and developing new combination vaccines for Covid-19 and influenza.\r\n\r\nNovavax offers an alternative adjuvanted vaccine against Covid-19. The company\u2019s Matrix-M technology has the potential to be used to develop other vaccines. This makes the partnership with Sanofi interesting, as Sanofi makes some of the top-selling annual flu vaccines.\r\n\r\nNVAX\u2019s meteoric rise in share price could be attractive to retail traders, particularly considering that over a third of its free float is shorted. While the deal with Sanofi may mean Novavax could provide dividends in the future, the company is currently unprofitable, making it a speculative meme stock to buy. In the past, Novavax has already seen a meteoric rise followed by a crash.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), the social trading company, couldn\u2019t be missing from a list of meme stocks to buy. Involved in the previous meme stock rally of 2021, HOOD has seen increased interest over the past week. Analysts have adopted a positive outlook for the Robinhood stock, believing the company remains financially sound even without a resurgence in retail trader activity. They point to accelerating organic sales growth and cost-cutting measures for the company\u2019s valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRecent analyst ratings broadly reflect current market expectations, with an analysts\u2019 price target of $20.39 maintaining pace. However, Robinhood has a history of exceeding analyst forecasts, as demonstrated by last quarter\u2019s earnings quadrupling projections.\r\n\r\nRobinhood has a very high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 138.1x, consistent with meme stocks. However, its relatively low short interest implies the potential to benefit from revived retail trading. This may develop more organically through higher trading volumes rather than attempting a risky short squeeze.\n\nWorkhorse Group (WKHS) Person holding cellphone with logo of American electric vehicle company Workhorse Group Inc. (WKHS) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe electric truck and drone manufacturer Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) displays typical characteristics as one of the meme stocks to buy. The company has recently witnessed its share price rally, surging as high as a 50% gain last week, accompanied by a boom in social media interest. However, this surge did not follow good news. The company announced job cuts back in March in an attempt to conserve cash.\r\n\r\nWorkhorse Group has seen the percentage of short positions rise to over 21%, making it more susceptible to a short squeeze. Few analysts track the WKHS stock, but those who do have been downgrading the company\u2019s outlook. This has placed retail traders at odds with the professionals, revealing a classic set-up preceding a meme stock craze.\n\nWith analysts\u2019 price target settled at $0.57 per share and increasing chances of a short squeeze, the WKHS stock may be due for a 90% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Sony Had A Good Q4 Game But It Needs To Figure Out How To Evolve Beyond PlayStation\n\nOn Tuesday, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY) reported its fourth quarter results. Sony\u2019s net profit grew from stronger earnings that were generated by its gaming and move business.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter And Fiscal Year Highlights\n\nFor the three months that ended in March,\u00a0\u00a0Sony reported revenue grew 13% YoY to 3.481 trillion yen, while net profit rose 34% YoY to 189.005 billion yen which is about $1.21 billion.\n\nThe gaming business reported that operating profit more than doubled to 105.98 billion yen,\u00a0while the movie business followed with a nearly doubled operating profit of\u00a030.67 billion yen.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Sony sold 20.8 million units of PlayStation 5, which is more than 19.1 million units\u00a0it sold during the previous fiscal year. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Sony annoucned it will be laying off about 900 employees from its PlayStation business in response to the videogame industry\u2019s struggles to regain its vigor in a post-pandemic reality. Back in October, Microsoft laid off about 8% of its videogaming workforce. Even GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME)\u00a0also announced job cuts.\n\nMoreover, the videogame retailer\u2019s stock plummeted on Friday as meme-stock mania faded. GameStop reported preliminary first quarter results and they showed a first quarter drop in sales. GameStop expects first quarter sales to range between\u00a0$872 million to $892 million\u00a0while it reported $1.24 billion during last year\u2019s comparable quarter. But, GameStop is also expecting to narrow down its net loss from last year\u2019s $50.5 million to somewhere between $27 million and $37 million.\n\nFiscal Year Outlook\n\nThe Japanese entertainment and electronics company plans to spin off its financial business, which is why it guided for\u00a0a revenue drop of 5.5% to 12.310 trillion yen and a net profit decline of 4.7% to 925\u00a0billion yen.\u00a0However, Sony guided for its game business\u00a0operating profit to continue to rise at 6.8% to 310\u00a0billion yen.\u00a0Sony also expects its movie business profits to rise 2% to 120\u00a0billion yen.\n\nSony and Microsoft rivalry will live on, but there\u2019s bigger fish to fry.\n\nBoth for Sony and its rival Microsoft, findings ways to grow revenue is more important than winning the console war. Microsoft undoubtedly upleveled its game by acquiring Activision Blizzard but console wars are becoming less and less relevant as both Microsoft and Sony need to figure out how to evolve in the new gaming era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\u00a0This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "GameStop Corp. GME has released preliminary financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, highlighting a tumultuous period for the retailer, with a significant drop in sales and strategic financial maneuvers. According to the report, net sales for the quarter are expected between $872 million and $892 million, suggesting a stark decline from the $1.237 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. This drop reflects the ongoing challenges within the retail sector and shifts in consumer behavior affecting GameStop.\n\nCost Management & Loss Reduction\n\nOn a promising note, the company has managed to reduce its selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), which are projected between $290 million and $300 million, suggesting a dip from the $345.7 million reported last year. This indicates an aggressive approach to cost management, likely a response to the declining revenues.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, GameStop expects the net loss for the quarter to narrow to $27-$37 million, suggesting an improvement from the net loss of $50.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This reduction in losses could be seen as a positive outcome of the company's ongoing restructuring efforts. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStrategic Share Offering\n\nIn an important strategic move, GameStop announced the potential sale of up to 45 million class A shares.\r\n\r\nThe decision to issue additional shares follows a turbulent period in the stock market, wherein GameStop's shares have been highly volatile. After a recent spike in the share price, attributed partly to the resurgence of interest from meme stock enthusiasts, the company's stock price experienced a sharp decline, falling 19.7% during the trading session on May 17.\n\nMarket Reaction & Forward Outlook\n\nAs the market reacts to these developments, the impacts of the additional share offering and the ongoing adjustments in GameStop's business strategy are closely monitored. Investors are particularly attuned to how these changes might stabilize the company's financials and influence its stock price in an increasingly unpredictable retail environment.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nGameStop's fiscal first-quarter preliminary results depict a company navigating through significant challenges but taking decisive steps to stabilize its financial health. The planned share offering, while dilutive, could provide the necessary capital to support GameStop's transformation in a rapidly evolving market. As the company continues to adjust its strategy, the coming quarters will be critical in determining its long-term viability and ability to return to profitability.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #5 (Strongly Sell) stock has declined 8.3% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s fall of 0.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks are Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

        "content": "The meme coin frenzy may have cooled off a bit as bitcoin has lost some upward momentum. However, markets for top meme tokens are still more liquid than they were earlier this year, indicating that these supposedly non-serious cryptocurrencies, often criticized for lacking utility, are here to stay.\n\nAccording to Kaiko Research, meme tokens have been resilient during the recent market correction, continuing to perform strongly despite historically being underperformers during downturns. Year-to-date (YTD) returns for these tokens range from 80% to 1800%, with trade volumes remaining strong.\n\nKaiko Research reports that the weekly trade volume for meme tokens surged by more than 200% YTD, reaching around $11 billion. This can be attributed to the tokens' accessibility and their ability to adapt to market trends, which has attracted community interest.\n\n\"Meme tokens have shown an unexpected resilience in the face of market corrections, maintaining strong trade volumes and performance,\" said an analyst from Kaiko Research. \"Their popularity is largely driven by their accessibility and the strong community interest they generate.\"\n\nHowever, meme coins tend to have higher leverage compared to most altcoins and are thus more influenced by speculative appetite.\n\nInterestingly, the correlation between meme tokens and other retail-driven speculative assets, such as meme stocks, has been relatively weak and highly volatile. For instance, the 60-day rolling correlation between the largest meme token, Dogecoin (DOGE), and the video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) has mostly remained below 0.3 over the past year.\n\nOver the past week, meme stocks received an unexpected boost, with GME and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) seeing a surge on May 13-14. This caused the correlation between DOGE and GME to reach its highest level in over a year.\n\n\"Meme stocks saw a notable uptick last week, which also affected the correlation between Dogecoin and GameStop,\" Kaiko Research added. \"This spike in correlation highlights the interconnected nature of retail-driven speculative assets.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDogecoin, meme token volumes remain resilient - Kaiko Research\n\nSEC likely to deny new Ether ETFs this week\n\nBitcoin price today: flat at $67k as analysts await more Fed cues\n\nView comments",

Robinhood Markets stock is the picks-and-shovels way to invest in the resurgence of meme stocks.\n\nWith meme stock mania seemingly heating back up, investors are eyeing shares of some of 2021\u2019s big meme stocks again. But rather than chase shares of a specific meme stock, the smart way to invest in the theme of retail investors piling back into the market is to invest in Robinhood Markets, which will continue to benefit from the influx of retail investors and increased trading volume.\n\nIn this sense, Robinhood can be thought of as the picks-and-shovels way to play a return of retail activity. Unlike Gamestop or AMC, I believe it\u2019s a great stock in its own right and doesn\u2019t need any short squeeze to head higher.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Robinhood stock based on its excellent user and deposit growth, its positioning as a picks-and-shovels play on increasing activity from retail investors, and its successful foray into new areas like IRAs and credit cards. The latter initiative is transforming Robinhood from a retail brokerage to a comprehensive financial powerhouse.\n\nMeme Stock Reawakening\n\nAs you\u2019ve likely seen by now, a Tweet from Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, the ringleader behind Gamestop\u2019s massive 2021 rally that set off the original \u201cmeme stock\u201d mania, marked his return to the platform after a multi-year hiatus. Many investors took this as a signal to rush into Gamestop and other meme stocks of that era, sending shares of these stocks on a wild ride this week.\n\nHowever, most of these investors would admit that this is a troubled company with less-than-promising long-term prospects, and the stock has considerable downside risk. For example, the GME stock\u2019s price target of $7 shows that even after the recent pullback, the stock still has downside potential of 68.5% (see below). Meanwhile, Robinhood is a thriving, growing business with a bright future.\n\nPicks-and-Shovels Play\n\nAs the go-to brokerage app for many new investors and retail investors, Robinhood is well-positioned to capitalize on an influx of new traders and a spike in trading activity. Currently, Robinhood is the #11 finance app in Apple\u2019s App Store, trailing everyday payments apps like Cash App and Venmo but leading the likes of Fidelity, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), a considerable achievement for the much smaller company.\n\nRobinhood recently released updated metrics for April, showing that business is booming. An impressive 90,000 customers opened accounts during the month, meaning that Robinhood now has 24 million customers. Robinhood also took in $4.9 billion in deposits. This represents a 45% annualized growth rate versus March. With this influx, the company has now taken in $27.4 billion in deposits over the last 12 months, representing 35% annualized growth versus April 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd keep in mind that these numbers are from before the meme stock resurgence kicked off in May. As more retail investors return to the market or are drawn to the market for the first time by news of the wild swings of meme stocks, Robinhood\u2019s user and deposit growth should continue.\n\nThis growth prompted Bank of America Securities to give Robinhood a double upgrade from Underperform to Buy, based on \u201c(1) rising retail engagement and accelerating organic growth; (2) positive operating leverage after large expense reductions; (3) attractive valuation following increases in EBITDA/EPS.\u201d Bank of America increased its price target on Robinhood from $14 to $24.\n\nBeyond meme stocks, Robinhood has made great progress in building the platform, expanding into new areas, and becoming a true financial ecosystem for its users.\n\nAttacking New Verticals\n\nThis isn\u2019t the same old Robinhood that it was in 2021 during the last meme stock frenzy. I previously covered Robinhood and its underrated transformation into a full-service financial ecosystem several months ago, and the stock has performed well since then. Robinhood launched IRAs last year and has made an aggressive move into the market by offering a 1% match on rollover deposits and a 3% match on deposits for Robinhood Gold members.\n\nThese maneuvers are helping it attract customers from its competitors. CEO Vlad Tenev says that the first quarter was the second quarter in a row in which the company had \u201cnet asset inflows from every other major brokerage \u2014 totaling $3 billion, more than twice our Q4 level.\u201d\n\nRobinhood is also making a splash in the credit card market with the launch of its upcoming Robinhood Gold card, which will be one of the offerings within its Robinhood Gold subscription service.\n\nThe eye-catching gold card, which is made of stainless steel and weighs in at 17 grams, offers users unlimited 3% cash back on all purchases. Tenev says that over one million customers have signed up for the Gold card waitlist and stated, \u201cWe can substantially grow Gold adoption as we roll out the card.\u201d The card could be a major growth driver for Robinhood Gold membership, as only half of the people on the waitlist are current Gold subscribers.\n\nTenev says that Robinhood Gold subscribers hit 1.7 million during the first quarter after 260,000 new customers signed up.\u00a0With these new offerings, Robinhood is smartly leveraging its success with retail investors in its brokerage business to move into new verticals, increase wallet share with its customers, and capture further growth.\n\nIs Robinhood Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, HOOD earns a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, eight Holds, and four Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average HOOD stock price target of $20.86 implies 3.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: An Up and Coming Financial Powerhouse\n\nRather than chasing after a stock like Gamestop during this meme stock revival, Robinhood could potentially be the best way to invest in a resurgence of retail investor activity. I\u2019m bullish on Robinhood because of the strong user growth and deposit growth it has already demonstrated this year and because it\u2019s well-positioned to capture further growth as more retail investors foray into the market.\n\nAdditionally, the company\u2019s expansion into lucrative verticals like IRAs and credit cards and its momentum in these areas have the potential to transform it from a retail brokerage into a true financial powerhouse over time. This makes it an attractive long-term investment opportunity, in my view.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Flash in the Pan Meme Moment Takes Some Stock Traders on Wild Ride",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The meme-stock revival was over almost as quickly as it began.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 25-Year-Old BofA Trader Dies Suddenly at Industry Outing China Attempts to End Property Crisis With Broad Rescue Package With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence US Company Becomes World\u2019s Most Valuable Solar Firm After Chinese Rivals Slip Zyn Shortage? Nicotine Pouches Out of Stock in Several US States\n\nGameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. \u2014 the poster children of 2021\u2019s frenzy \u2014 saw shares surge at the start of the week only to fizzle, with the bulk of those gains erased just days later. Other speculative corners of the market, mainly beaten-down stocks that have drawn the scrutiny of short-selling hedge funds, saw their booms mostly go bust while the broader US stock market powered to record highs.\n\nRead MLIV Pulse: Meme-Stocks Pop Signals Too Much Froth in Stocks\n\nAn X post from Keith Gill \u2014 one of the masterminds behind the Covid-era spike in GameStop, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d\u2014 set social media platforms abuzz into Monday morning as traders, both amateur and professional, pounced on old day-trading standbys and other stocks that seemed susceptible to a short squeeze. However, unlike the 2021 delirium that lasted weeks and resulted in congressional hearings and lawsuits, the revival of meme stocks was a flash in the pan.\n\nWith the rally quickly losing its shine, AMC shares have slipped more than 60% from an $11.88 intraday year-to-date high while GameStop gave back almost all of its gains. The differences between the two frenzies \u2014 if you can call the latest iteration that \u2014 were quickly apparent. In 2021, GameStop soared more than 1,000% in a matter of days, making this week\u2019s peak look tame as the pair only held onto mere double-digit gains for the week.\n\nStill, a more than 100% rally over four weeks is nothing to completely shrug off for the video-game retailer. The stock has put together four consecutive weeks of gains, adding some $3.6 billion over that stretch, though it\u2019s still more than 80% below a 2021 high.\n\nBoth companies moved to capitalize on the rallies to shore up their cash reserves this week. GameStop arranged to sell up to 45 million shares in a so-called at-the-market program, enabling its bank to create shares for sale, with the proceeds being added to its balance sheet.\n\nFor AMC, the beleaguered movie chain was able to raise more than $250 million through share sales and a debt-for-equity swap though it still faces more than $4 billion in debt, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. This week\u2019s gains look like a blip given it\u2019s still down some 90% over the past 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn aspect of 2024\u2019s meme stock moment is how fleeting it was and the lack of follow-through from retail traders. Yes, GameStop saw more than 10-times its recent average number of shares traded at the start of the week while AMC had more than 1.7 billion shares change hands over the five-day span, but the notional value is nothing compared to 2021.\n\nEven with the jump in volume, activity for retail traders on things like Fidelity\u2019s platform was a fraction of levels seen three years ago with retail traders placing sell orders roughly matching those that were placed to buy.\n\nOptions markets also whipsawed traders, with short-term GameStop and AMC prices implying well over 500% annualized volatility at one point, before dropping to about half that by week\u2019s end. Even as shares retreated below $40, some traders were buying GameStop calls that would only pay out if the stock rocketed back up above $128 by Friday.\n\nThe sky-high costs attracted the attention of noted bond trader Bill Gross, who said he sold so-called straddles on both companies, betting the wild swings would become more muted.\n\nThe rally in AMC and GameStop ate away at profits for short sellers, traders who gain on a stock\u2019s decline, meaning billions in paper losses for the group as the stocks surged. Of course, those losses were partially reversed when the shares fell back to earth.\n\nThe exuberance for the top meme stocks lifted shares of other companies that are also popular with the retail crowd and often trade more on sentiment than fundamentals. This group \u2014 which includes Tupperware Brands Corp., Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. \u2014 has high short interest as a percentage of float, meaning that contrarian traders have borrowed most available shares to bet against them.\n\nWith the markets placid once again, some of the companies that got lifted in the meme-stock resurgence remain beaten down over the past year.\n\nTake Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.; shares have surged about 2,000% this week, but are still down some 98% over the last 12 months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019 Walgreens and CVS Are Trying to Fix America\u2019s Flailing Pharmacies How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Milei Targets Labor Law That\u2019s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance The DNA Test Delusion\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Spot silver surpassed $30 an ounce to hit the highest level in more than a decade in a rally that has become more forceful and fast than gold\u2019s gains amid robust financial and industrial demand.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nChina Attempts to End Property Crisis With Broad Rescue Package With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence US Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Voters Prefer Trump Over Biden on Economy. This Data Shows Why A 25-Year-Old BofA Trader Dies Suddenly at Industry Outing\n\nThe precious metal rose as much as 4.2% to $30.81 an ounce, the highest intraday level since February 2013. Silver has soared 29% this year, outpacing gold and making it one of the year\u2019s best-performing major commodities.\n\nSilver has rallied on the back of surging investor interest, with an increasingly supportive macroeconomic backdrop as well as a projected fourth annual market deficit. The price rally was accelerated Friday, helped by spillover sentiment in the broad metals markets and by the mania in the so-called meme stocks.\n\nCopper and Gold Close In on Records as Metals Mayhem Continues\n\n\u201cThis week was kind of the recreation of the meme stock,\u201d Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures, said Friday in a phone interview. Those speculators naturally look for different areas to exploit. And silver is usually the one that they favor.\u201d\n\nSilver was a target market of Reddit retail traders in 2021 amid a buying stampede in GameStop Corp. and other small-cap stocks that captivated the financial world.\n\nThe precious metal\u2019s break through the $30 level may trigger substantial exchange-traded funds buying activity that may increase the risks of a silver squeeze, particularly with the renewal of the \u201cmeme stock\u201d craze which filtered into silver markets last time around, according to TD Securities senior commodity strategist Daniel Ghali.\n\nInvestors remain net sellers of physically-backed silver ETFs so far this year, with holdings down 1.7% as of Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Money managers remained net bullish on Comex silver futures, with gross shorts held by them accounting for 12.5% of total open interest as of May 7, according to CFTC data.\n\nSilver has soared by more than a quarter this year, outpacing gold and making it one of the year\u2019s best-performing major commodities. Still, in relative terms to gold, silver is still cheap.\n\nThe two precious metals move largely in tandem as both offer similar macro- and currency-hedging properties. With gold hitting a record on central bank buying, retail interest in China and a resurgence in bets that lower US interest rates are on the way, silver has gone along for the ride. Although there\u2019s been scant interest from investors in silver-backed exchange-traded funds, physical sales have picked up, including at Singapore-based dealer Silver Bullion Pte.\n\nStory continues\n\nSilver has a dual character, valued both for its uses as a financial asset and an industrial input, including clean-energy technologies. The metal is a key ingredient in solar panels, and with robust growth in that industry, usage of the metal is expected to reach a record this year, according to the Silver Institute. Against that backdrop, the market is headed for a fourth year in deficit, with this year\u2019s shortage seen as the second biggest on record.\n\n(Adds analyst comments from fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNeuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019 Walgreens and CVS Are Trying to Fix America\u2019s Flailing Pharmacies How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Milei Targets Labor Law That\u2019s Set to Hand Banker $10 Million Severance The DNA Test Delusion\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hedge funds squeezed from short bets amid surging meme stocks, Goldman Sachs says",
        "content": "By Nell Mackenzie\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds ditched bearish stock bets early this week at some of the highest rates in three years as U.S. meme stocks rallied sharply, a Goldman note seen by Reuters on Friday showed.\n\nThe note, published on Wednesday just before the rally faded, said hedge funds dropped positions on the most actively shorted stocks tracked by a Goldman Sachs index. These funds also piled into long bets just as retail investor favourites, GameStop and AMC soared on the return of social media account \"Roaring Kitty\" -- a central player in the 2021 meme-stock rally.\n\nA short position is a bet that the value of an asset will fall, whereas a long position wagers it will rise.\n\nMost hedge fund short covering, when investors have to buy back stock borrowed for bearish bets, came from stocks tracked in the Goldman Sachs index, the bank's note said. This index includes AMC and GameStop, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe index, which rose by over 5% during the week, was up just 0.5% on Friday, LSEG data showed.\n\nSystematic hedge funds, whose algorithms catch market trends, piled into long positions on Monday, while losing about 1.1% by Tuesday, the cohort's second worst day of the year, Goldman Sachs prime brokerage, which tracks hedge funds, said in the note.\n\nHowever, the group remains up 11.6% for the year to May 14, the Goldman note showed.\n\nHedge funds taking long and short bets based on fundamental factors were down 0.3% on Wednesday but up 7% for the year so far.\n\nGameStop and AMC fell for a second straight session on Thursday, as the \"Roaring Kitty\" excitement died down.\n\nShares of the videogame retailer GameStop tumbled 30% to close at $27.67 after jumping as high as $64.83 on Tuesday. Theatre chain AMC closed 15.3% lower at $4.64.\n\n(Reporting by Nell Mackenzie; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Jane Merriman)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Is Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Soaring Today",
        "content": "Why Is Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) jumped 7.5% in the morning session after it received a double rating upgrade from Bank of America analyst. The analyst upgraded the stock's rating from Underperform (Sell) to Buy and raised the price target from $14 to $24. The new price target represents more than a 25% upside from where shares traded when the upgrade was announced. The analyst added, citing the reasons for the upgrade, \"We view the current entry point as the opposite of 2021 when we initiated at Underperform after its IPO given: (1) rising retail engagement and accelerating organic growth; (2) positive operating leverage after large expense reductions; (3) attractive valuation following increases in EBITDA/EPS.\"\n\nIs now the time to buy Robinhood? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nRobinhood's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 19 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago, when the company gained 9.9% as heavily shorted stocks (so-called meme stocks) continued to rally, with both AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) up more than 60%. On May 13, 2024, famous Wall Street Bets (Reddit stock trading forum) trader Keith Gill (known online as Roaring Kitty) returned to Twitter (also known as X) after three years, fueling a greater retail appetite for meme stocks. These moves could also drive volumes on trading platforms such as Robinhood as more retail investors jump on the bandwagon.\n\nRobinhood is up 61.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $19.93 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $20.13 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood's shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $572.66.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "title": "3 Must-Buy Meme Stocks When Prices Plunge",
        "content": "The meme stock season seems to be back. Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) has surged over 200% in the last month, with big gains coming in a few trading days. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has also skyrocketed more than 290% in the last month. These are just two examples and speak volumes about the ferocity of the rally. Of course, I would not look at these overbought ideas, but I would certainly consider some meme stocks to buy if there is a broad market correction.\n\nAn important point to note is that GDP growth in the U.S. has decelerated in Q1 2024. There are reasons for the market to feed nervous if the first-rate cut is delayed \u2014 there could be a deep price correction.\n\nHowever, any such correction would be a good opportunity to buy meme stocks. Rate cuts are inevitable, and easy money policies tend to support speculative activity across asset classes. So, I believe a bigger meme stock rally might be on the cards a few quarters down the line. Let\u2019s discuss the meme stocks to buy for stellar returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) stock has been subdued in the last 12 months. However, the meme stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 22. I expect a big breakout on the upside in the coming quarters on the back of positive business developments.\n\nThe first point to note is that Riot ended Q1 2024 with a cash buffer (including Bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings) of $1.3 billion. Further, with a zero-debt balance sheet, the company has high financial flexibility to pursue aggressive growth.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the company has set an ambitious target of increasing hash rate capacity from 12.4 EH/s in Q1 2024 to 31.5 EH/s by the end of the year. If Bitcoin remains in an uptrend, this expansion will translate into stellar revenue and EBITDA growth.\n\nI must add that Riot plans to increase capacity to 100 EH/s by 2027. With these positives, it\u2019s surprising the RIOT stock has remained sideways. It\u2019s a golden opportunity to accumulate before the stock skyrockets.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has witnessed a rally of around 50% from 52-week lows. However, PLUG stock has plunged in the last few quarters and remains attractive even after the recent rally. If the stock is depressed due to broad market sentiments, it would be a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nThe company also has a big new catalyst likely to drive the stock higher. The company recently announced a commitment by the U.S. Department of Energy for a conditional loan of $1.66 billion. PLUG would utilize the loan to \u201cfinance the development, construction and ownership of up to six green hydrogen production facilities.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Plug Power had ambitious expansion plans, funding and execution were the main challenges. The commitment from the U.S. DoE is likely to alleviate the concerns. However, I would still look at PLUG stock as a trading bet rather than an investment opportunity. Blue-chip companies are making big investments in the hydrogen economy. I prefer to stick to those ideas from a long-term investment perspective.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nI would like to remind investors that Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock was trading below $5 at the beginning of October 2020. When Biden assumed power, TLRY stock skyrocketed above $60 in February 2021. With the presidential election around the corner and cannabis likely to be a hot topic of discussion, I would hold TLRY stock.\n\nFrom a business perspective, Tilray focused on diversification last year. Backed by acquisitions, the Tilray is the fifth largest craft beer manufacturer in the United States. Presence in the U.S. also provides a strong strategic infrastructure for aggressive expansion in the scenario of federal-level legalization of cannabis.\n\nEven in the cannabis segment, Tilray has been reporting healthy growth. For Q3 2024, global cannabis net revenue increased by 33% on a year-on-year basis. With Tilray having a presence in the medicinal and recreational cannabis business, the addressable market is significant.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- This week\u2019s meme-stock pop is a sign that US equity markets are frothy and potentially peaking, according to the latest Bloomberg Markets Live Pulse survey.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early With a BlackRock CEO, $9 Trillion Vanguard Braces for Turbulence China Unveils Broad Rescue Package to Prop Up Housing Market Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019\n\nGameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., two darlings of the meme-stock mania of 2021, saw their share prices soar \u2014 then plunge \u2014 after Keith Gill, the retail-trading icon who goes by the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d put up a cryptic post on the social-media platform X. GameStop surged nearly 180% on Monday and Tuesday, while AMC leaped 135%, before both sold off on Wednesday and Thursday to cut those gains by more than half.\n\nWhile the wild price action rekindled memories of the meme-stock frenzy from just a few years ago, many of the 230 respondents in the MLIV Pulse poll were skeptical that it was an encouraging sign for the overall stock market. With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes setting new all-time highs this week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eclipsing 40,000 for the first time ever, more than 40% of those polled see the trading in GameStop and AMC as a sign of undue euphoria and a potential reason to sell.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have seen a surge in meme stocks like this unless equities were already somewhat exuberant,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC, said over the phone.\n\nThe MLIV Pulse survey found that 43% of participants view the surge in meme stocks as a contrarian warning for the market going forward. Roughly a quarter view it as a positive sign for share prices. Meanwhile, 66% of respondents say it poses no real threat to the overall equity market.\n\nThe latest spike in meme stocks is basically a blip compared to the boom in 2021. Back then, retail traders fueled massive rallies by banding together to pump up the share prices of companies Wall Street was betting against. That action was born out of lockdown boredom, no-fee brokers and social-media chatrooms, and it took weeks for investors and Wall Street pros to wrap their heads around. One similarity is several poll respondents pointed to bored investors as a reason for the latest moves.\n\nStocks are rallying now largely because the resilient US economy, with robust consumer spending and ebbing inflation, is powering growth and bolstering the outlook for Corporate America.\n\nStory continues\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers have made it clear that they plan to keep borrowing costs higher for longer to rein in prices. And this kind economic strength gives policymakers little reason to rush interest-rate cuts.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed waits too long to cut rates, it may lead to economic weakness and pressure shares,\u201d said Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg. \u201cThough meme stocks have corrected quickly, which is a healthy sign for markets. Valuations are high, but they can stay that way for very long periods of time while stocks continue to rise.\u201d\n\nWhile investor confidence has been building, one sector of the market suggests it isn\u2019t overextended yet. Leveraged long exchange-traded funds \u2014 which use derivatives to amplify daily index returns \u2014 aren\u2019t showing anywhere near the enthusiasm they did in 2021\u2019s meme-stock mania, according to Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nAnother big difference between this latest move in meme stocks and the mania of 2021 is sophisticated traders, rather than retail investors, drove it this time. GameStop was the most active stock for client orders over five trading sessions through Wednesday at Interactive Brokers, with AMC in 17th place, according to Sosnick.\n\nAnd while GameStop saw net buying interest, there also was net selling interest in the options market, which suggests covered call writing or other risk-controlled strategies by investors beyond mere speculation, Sosnick added.\n\nThat\u2019s why Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, is shorting the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT). GameStop is the fund\u2019s largest weighing, while debt-strapped online car retailer Carvana Co. \u2014 another meme favorite \u2014 is the second-biggest.\n\n\u201cTrying to short some of these meme stocks is too dangerous,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cGod knows if Roaring Kitty will keep tweeting. I don\u2019t need that stress in my life.\u201d\n\nThe MLIV Pulse survey is conducted among Bloomberg readers on the terminal and online by Bloomberg\u2019s Markets Live team.

        "content": "GameStop (GME) Up 75% This Week, Yet This Unofficial GameStop Meme Coin Is Up 10x More\n\nIf you have been following meme stocks or have seen the movie Dumb Money, you are inevitably aware of the GameStop (GME) story. The stock, which had a bleak outlook and had lost nearly all of its value during the 2010s shot up in value, going from less than $1 to an ATH of over $466. The move was largely due to huge amounts of investment from retail traders on r/WallStreetBets, led by internet personality Roaring Kitty.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nBitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year \u2013 how much would you need to get started today? According to Cathie Wood, holding 6 Ethereum (ETH) could make you a millionaire, here\u2019s why it can be true.\n\nThe GameStop saga seemingly ended in early 2021, shortly after reaching highs. Roaring Kitty, who led the charge, stopped posting on social media, and the price of GME fell considerably. However, in May 2024, Roaring Kitty made a return to social media by posting a meme on X, which has received over 26 million views. It had been over three years since he last posted, and the return caused the price of GME to spike.\n\nGME stock went from less than $17 on the Friday before the post, which came on a Sunday, to a high of nearly $65 on the following Tuesday. Additionally, AMC, another meme stock that is not directly associated with Roaring Kitty, also surged more than 300%, going from less than $3 to a high of nearly $12.\n\nWhile it is not entirely surprising that GME and AMC saw huge amounts of trading volume and price increases after the post from Roaring Kitty, it is somewhat more unexpected that a crypto memecoin would also benefit from the posts and to a higher degree than GME and AMC themselves.\n\nTrending: If you invested $1000 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today.\n\nA memecoin simply called GameStop (GME) was launched in early 2024 during the run-up of the memecoin craze. At the time, tons of new tokens were popping up each day, and creators of the tokens were looking for new memes to attract investors and increase the price. While the novelty of a GME memecoin did help propel the token to small gains initially, the hype died up within a month, and the price fell more than 96% from highs.\n\nHowever, when the post from Roaring Kitty dropped, the price of the token began to increase very quickly as the news spread and more people began to discover the token. Within a few hours of the post, the price of the token increased by over 600%.\n\nOver the next few days, the token continued to go up. Starting from less than $0.0005, the token went as high as $0.022. This marked a gain of over 4,300% in just three days, making the 300% gains of GME and AMC appear minuscule in comparison.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe token is down approximately 70% from those highs, but is still up more than 1,400% from prices before the post.\n\nThe story of GME, which was built on ideas of retail traders overcoming the larger players in finance, inevitably bled over into the crypto space, which shares many of the same ideals. However, in this case, a GME memecoin outperformed the stock itself.\n\nRead Next:\n\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how much would $10 get you today?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures moved little in evening deals on Thursday, tracking a weak finish on Wall Street as several Federal Reserve officials warned that bets on interest rate cuts were potentially premature.\n\nSome softer-than-expected consumer inflation readings drove Wall Street to record highs on Wednesday and Thursday. But indexes failed to hold those highs after the Fed warnings, while traders also slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut.\n\nS&P 500 Futures steadied at 5,320.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat at 18,653.0 points by 19:36 ET (23:36 GMT). Dow Jones Futures were flat at 40,017.0 points.\n\nA rebound in Treasury yields also weighed on stocks.\n\nFed officials warn more confidence needed to cut\n\nA slew of Fed officials warned on Wednesday and Thursday that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic welcomed the softer inflation data, but warned that one positive data point did not indicate a trend, and that no expectations for rate cuts were locked in by the central bank.\n\nBefore Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams said that while the development in consumer inflation was positive, it still did not warrant an immediate reduction in interest rates.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that the Fed needed to hold rates high for longer to bring inflation down, and that the central bank needed more evidence that price pressures were cooling.\n\nAll three Fed officials are voting members of the Fed's rate-setting committee.\n\nTheir comments saw investors second-guess expectations for rate cuts this year, with traders slightly paring bets on a 25 basis point reduction in September, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.\n\nWall St loses steam after record highs\n\nPersistent doubts over the rate cuts saw Wall Street close lower on Thursday after making record highs. The prospect of high for longer interest rates bodes poorly for stock valuations, especially in the technology sector.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,297.10 points, while the NASDAQ Composite fell 0.3% to 16,698.32 points on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 39,869.38 points.\n\nAftermarket movers: Reddit surges on OpenAI partnership\n\nAmong major after-hours movers, social media platform Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) jumped over 11% after it entered a partnership with artificial intelligence major OpenAI to add its content to the firm\u2019s AI products.\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software Inc (NASDAQ:TTWO) fell 2.6% after it issued disappointing annual earnings guidance, with the videogame publisher set to release its hotly awaited GTA VI title only in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nDXC Technology Co (NYSE:DXC) sank 20% after it also offered disappointing annual guidance.\n\nSo-called meme stocks GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) saw some relief in after-hours trade, rising 3.4% and 5.9%, respectively. The two plummeted between 15% and 30% on Thursday as a rebound rally ran dry.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures flat as Fed comments cool rate cut optimism\n\nEarnings call: Under Armour outlines turnaround strategy amid challenges\n\nEarnings call: Copa Holdings announced a net profit of $176.1 million\n\nView comments",

One, he\u2019s revealed his Q1\u20192024 portfolio, which include some surprising moves which show Burry is once again swimming against the tide (more on that later). Second, amid the return of Roaring Kitty on Twitter, meme stock boys on Reddit and Twitter are recalling how Burry was the first notable investor who started piling into GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), long before it became famous due to the historic meme stock rally and short squeeze episodes of 2021. Michael Burry, in the fourth quarter of 2018, bought a $6.8 million position in GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME). Over the next few quarters he bought and sold the stock, following the classic Burry playbook, before liquidating his entire stake in the company in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nBurry rose to limelight after accurately predicting the 2008 US housing crash, but over the past several years his persistent warnings about recessions and market crashes have turned out to be wrong. After betting against the broader semiconductor industry, Burry closed his short position in iShares Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (ticker SOXX) in the last quarter of 2023. He also closed his bets against the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nFilings for the first quarter of 2024 show Burry was busy buying many new stocks. In this article we will take a look at some important stocks that account for about 42% of Burry's Q1 portfolio, which was worth about $103 million as of the end of March 2024.\n\nTo see more important stocks in Burry's portfolio, click 8 Stocks Michael Burry Has Invested 55% of His Portfolio In.

It accounts for about 7.36% of his total portfolio.\n\nCitigroup Inc (NYSE:C)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $7,905,000\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 7.63%\n\nScion Asset Management increased its stake in Citigroup Inc\u00a0(NYSE:C)\u00a0by 25% in the first quarter of 2023, closing the period with 125,000 shares of the bank worth about $7.9 million. Citigroup Inc\u00a0(NYSE:C)\u00a0accounts for about 7.65 of Scion\u2019s total Q1 portfolio.

The investment has been rewarding Burry as Citigroup Inc\u00a0(NYSE:C)\u00a0shares are up 23% this year through May 16.\n\nStory continues\n\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCitigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) gained 24.1% in the quarter continuing its uptrend from 4Q. The company is on a multi-year journey to reorganize the business and reach return on tangible common equity of 11-12% by 2026 (and higher further out). Citigroup is finally taking the hard actions necessary, cutting unprofitable departments, taking out middle management layers, and reducing overall headcount. As of early March, the company was 70% done with its business exits and had reduced management layers by 1/4th. We have high confidence Citi will hit its targets. In the meantime, the company is returning cash to shareholders, which could meaningfully increase if the Basel III capital proposal is changed.\u201d\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $8,338,250\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 8.05%\n\nHealthcare facilities provider HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is one of the top stock picks of Michael Burry in 2024. Burry bought a stake in HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in the last quarter of 2023 after a long hiatus (Burry sold his entire stake in HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) back in 2016). He increased his stake in HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) by 25% in the first quarter, ending the period with an $8.34 million stake.\n\nOver the past one year HCA\u00a0Healthcare Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:HCA)\u00a0shares have gained about 18%. The stock accounts for about 8% of Michael Burry\u2019s total Q1 portfolio.\n\nOakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)\u00a0in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe eliminated one position,\u00a0HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), during the quarter as the stock traded at our estimate of fair value. HCA was a very good investment and more than quadrupled from our original investment price in 2016. We believe HCA is a well-managed business with the best collection of assets in the hospital space. Hospital stocks tend to be much more volatile than their actual intrinsic value, and we would gladly purchase HCA again if the discount to value warrants.\u201d\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $9,045,000\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 8.74%\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the top stock picks of Michael Burry in 2024. He\u2019s been increasing his hold in the\u00a0 Chinese e-commerce giant since the third quarter of 2023, when he bought 50,000 shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). In the fourth quarter, Burry added to his position in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), ending the year with 75,000 shares of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA). In the March quarter, Burry again piled into the stock, increasing his position in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) by 67%.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA) shares have gained about 8% so far this year. Baird recently said that it\u2019s seeing some \"early momentum\" in Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\u00a0as Alibaba Group Holding Limited\u00a0(NYSE:BABA)\u00a0focuses more on customers and Cloud growth.\n\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPretty much all of our holdings rose during the quarter. Only one stock declined by more than a couple of percent\u2014Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), which was down 9% for the quarter and 12% for the year. This investment continues to be a disappointment. We estimate the shares are trading at around 5X EBITA\u2014a valuation normally reserved for a company with evaporating profits. While it\u2019s true Alibaba is underperforming its peers in the market, the fact is it remains the market leader in its core businesses, and the business is still growing. In the most recent quarter, revenues grew 9% and profits grew 26%.It\u2019s not evaporating.\n\nThe management seems to be making meaningful changes designed to enhance shareholder value, including structural changes to improve profitability and restore its competitive position. It is monetizing non-core assets and making improvements in capital allocation. A lot of good things are happening that are not yet recognized in the share price. There are reasons\u2014primarily geopolitical\u2014for this, but at the current valuation, we could easily see the shares double and they would still be cheap.\u201d\n\nJD.Com Inc (NASDAQ:JD)\n\nMichael Burry's Q1'2024 Stake: $9,860,400\n\nPercentage of Burry's Portfolio: 9.52%\n\nWhile everyone (including Warren Buffett) in the US is fleeing Chinese stocks amid geopolitical uncertainty and US government\u2019s new tariffs, Burry is piling into some of the biggest Chinese stocks, cementing his status as a contrarian investor and true maverick. Scion Asset Management increased its stake in the Chinese ecommerce company by 80% in the first quarter, ending the period with a $9.8 million stake. JD.Com Inc (NASDAQ:JD) shares have gained about 23% year to date through May 16.\n\nThese were just 5 stocks in Burry's portfolio.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 8 Other Stocks Michael Burry Has 50% of His Portfolio Invested In.\n\nDisclosure: None\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Renaissance Technologies LLC, the quantitative fund founded by the late Jim Simons, loaded up on shares of meme-stock darlings AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. ahead of the latest rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019 Dow Average Is Trading Near Historic 40,000 Mark: Markets Wrap Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt\n\nThe hedge fund bought 3.82 million shares of AMC in the first quarter of 2024, adding to its position in the movie theater chain, according to regulatory filings. At the same time, Renaissance also snapped up 1 million shares of GameStop, revealing a new position during the three months ending March 31, filings show.\n\nRead more: Jim Simons, Code Breaker Who Mastered Investing, Dies at 86\n\nShares of AMC and GameStop more than doubled at the start of the week in a surge reminiscent of the 2021 meme-stock trading craze when retail traders bid the stocks up to record highs. The frenzy was sparked by a Sunday X post from Keith Gill, who rose to fame in 2021 by posting about GameStop on Reddit under the online moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d\n\nThe rally has since cooled; AMC shares slipped as much as 16% Thursday while GameStop shares fell as much as 28%. Pressures remain with both the stocks trading well below pandemic peaks. Shares of AMC and GameStop both slumped in the first quarter of 2024, falling 39% and 29%, respectively.\n\nRenaissance didn\u2019t immediately respond to a Bloomberg News request for comment.\n\nOf course, the filings are just a snapshot into US stock holdings for the funds that oversee more than $100 million. The data only tracks holdings through the end of March; the funds could have changed positions in the past month and a half.\n\n\u201cQuant/hedge funds are much better equipped to handle these situations nowadays,\u201d wrote Vanda Research\u2019s Marco Iachini in a note to clients this week. \u201cIf anything, we believe the chances that they participate along with retail in the squeeze but also lean against and then exit these trades ahead of retail traders are high.\u201d\n\nRead more: GameStop, AMC Extend Slump as Meme-Fueled Rally Unravels\n\nRenaissance wasn\u2019t the only hedge fund to trade the buzzy meme stocks in the earliest months of the year.\n\nBalyasny Asset Management LP added both AMC and GameStop in the first quarter.

        "title": "Peconic Hedge Fund Winning Streak Persists With 18% Gain in 2024",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bill Harnisch came into the new year with a cautious view on equities. That hasn\u2019t kept his $1.8 billion hedge fund from delivering a market-beating return in the face of a formidable rally.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early Putin and Xi Vow to Step Up Fight to Counter US \u2018Containment\u2019 Jamie Dimon Sees \u2018Lot of Inflationary Forces in Front of Us\u2019 Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt Dow Average Makes History to Hit the 40,000 Mark: Markets Wrap\n\nWith his fund up 18% through Wednesday, the founder of Peconic Partners is building on a four-year stretch of outperformance that includes a 26% gain in 2022, a year the S&P 500 Index plunged.\n\nIn an interview, he credited the recent success to a slew of bold stock wagers that proved prescient, including a bearish bet against Starbucks Corp., the coffee chain, as well as bullish positions in long-held infrastructure plays like Quanta Services Inc. and Dycom Industries Inc.\n\nConvinced power demand will boom amid the proliferation of artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, the money manager started snapping up utilities in March \u2014 including NextEra Energy Inc. and Southern Co. \u2014 before the industry took off as the market\u2019s leader.\n\nOf course, not everything paid off. A short position in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, for instance, has offset gains. Still, the winning bets are large enough to put the New York-based fund on solid footing to start the year.\n\nWhile the S&P 500 just eclipsed the 5,300 level for the first time ever on an 11% advance year-to-date, Harnisch\u2019s skepticism persists. At the stock benchmark\u2019s current altitude, more gains are unlikely this year, with valuations stretched, he says. As inflation softens and the economy slows, he expects 10-year Treasury yields to fall to 4% or even lower by December, a backdrop that bodes well for dividend-paying stocks such as utilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to conceive a market that\u2019s going to run away to the upside,\u201d said Harnisch, who started in the financial industry at Chase Manhattan Bank in 1968. \u201cIf the rates do come down, utilities probably would be a good place to be because you have a fundamental story on the economic side as well as a good story on the yield side.\u201d\n\nThe fund\u2019s net leverage \u2014 a measure of risk appetite that takes into account long versus short positions \u2014 peaked near 50% earlier this year and has since dropped to 36%. Power producers now make up roughly 15% of its long book, a fairly audacious bet considering the industry represents less than 3% of the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm echoes Wall Street strategists, whose average year-end target for the S&P 500 calls for a 4% drop through December. At the same time, it contrasts with hedge fund peers. Long-short funds last week boosted equity exposure, driving their net leverage to the highest level in more than two years, according to data compiled by Morgan Stanley\u2019s prime brokerage unit.\n\nHarnisch, who started Peconic in 2004, says the renewed concern over inflation is likely overdone. The sanguine stance is a departure from the better part of the last two years, when he kept warning that the market under-estimated the risk of persistent pricing pressures. Now that the labor market is cooling, inflation will trend lower, he says.\n\n\u201cWhen supply chain shortages began, all we were hearing about were price increases and we hardly hear any of that now,\u201d he said, citing conversations with companies, while pointing to smaller percentages on new price hikes. \u201cWhen there are increases, it is more ones and twos, not eights and tens.\u201d\n\nBack in January, the market veteran expressed concern over the stock market, saying hopes that the Federal Reserve would embark on a monetary-easing cycle as soon as March were misplaced. Bond traders have since pared back their bets on the size of interest-rate cuts for 2024 as the central bank held rates at a two-decade high.\n\nThe bull market in stocks, however, rages on.\n\nPeconic focuses on discovering companies that will grow faster than the economy in the long run. On the short side, the team builds hedges to offset the risk from the core holdings while looking for mispriced shares.\n\nHarnisch calls GameStop Corp. a \u201ctempting short\u201d target, citing the risk that the video-game retailer may go out of business. But he has refrained from placing any bets given the stock\u2019s prices are often detached from business fundamentals and instead driven by sentiment. This week, shares of GameStop led a surge in meme stocks following the return of Keith Gill to social media before plunging.\n\nWith the goal to build a portfolio that stands to shine regardless of market conditions, Harnisch says he\u2019s ready to double down on high-conviction bets.\n\n\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time because we want to know more about a stock than anybody else on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not dependent on the market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Neuralink\u2019s First Patient: \u2018It Blows My Mind So Much\u2019 The DNA Test Delusion Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Europe\u2019s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for GameStop and other meme stocks, including AMC, with big swings followed by heavy selling, absent concrete news. Instead, the activity has been fueled by the return of social media investor \"Roaring Kitty,\" also known as Keith Gill, who started posting on X after a three-year hiatus.\n\nThe extreme volatility has cost short sellers \u2013 those betting the shares will fall \u2013 big time. GameStop shares are up over 126% this week, costing the shorts more than $1.8 billion this month alone, according to Ortex, which compiles short interest data. Losses kick in at $39.70 per share.\n\nGAMESTOP FRENZY: WHO IS ROARING KITTY?\n\nAMC shares have risen 88% this week, costing shorts more than $157 million, also according to Ortex. For AMC, losses kick in at $5.73 per share. This week the theater chain raised $250 million in a stock sale.\n\nStill, Ortex notes short positions based on the float, or number of shares available for trading, have ticked higher this week for both stocks, \"signaling that short sellers have not closed any positions,\" the firm stated. This suggests the likelihood of more downside versus upside.\n\nWHAT GAMESTOP INVESTORS AND TAYLOR SWIFT FANS HAVE IN COMMON\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe head-scratching posts, some say, are nonsensical. The first post on Sunday was a cartoon drawing of two gamers \u2013 with one appearing to be leaning in, noted by a red arrow.\n\nGill has continued posting this week, featuring clips from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" which morphed into \"Breaking Bad\" and the poignant \"no fighting\" scene delivered by Cillian Murphy from \"Peaky Blinders,\" and \"Tombstone\" starring Kurt Russell.\n\nMany of the posts share a fighting theme or one preparing for something nefarious, such as the well-known scene from \"The Town\" in which Ben Affleck says to accomplice Jeremy Renner, \"I need your help, but I can't tell you what it is.\"\n\n\"It's actually kind of fascinating how much we don't really know what's going on in the markets,\" said Afterhour founder and CEO Kevin Xu, described as an early Reddit investor, during a Wednesday appearance on FOX Business' \"The Big Money Show.\"\n\nOriginal article source:GameStop, AMC short sellers double down even with stock swings\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Retail darlings GameStop and AMC continued their slide into premarket trading on Thursday, as the euphoria over the return of \"Roaring Kitty\", who was the central figure in 2021 meme stock rally, fizzles out.\n\nShares of the struggling videogame retailer GameStop fell 16% to $33 after jumping as much as $64.83 so far this week. Theater chain AMC shed 13% following an 88% gain since Friday's close.\n\nDespite the losses on Wednesday, the two companies were among the top three most-traded shares by retail investors during the session, data from J.P.Morgan showed, a position they have held every day this week.\n\nThe sharp surge in the shares began after a series of posts from Keith Gill's X account \"Roaring Kitty\", whose bullish posts on GameStop was a reason for the 2021 meme stocks frenzy.\n\nBut unlike 2021 when Reddit users banded together to target highly shorted stocks that burnt bearish hedge funds, this time retail and institutional investors were part of the meme stock mania, Vanda Research, which tracks retail investor flows, said.\n\nSince his first post on Sunday, Gill has put out dozens of cryptic movies clips a day on X.com. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on what the posts mean and whether he planned on making his investments public again.\n\nFormer U.S. SEC Chair Jay Clayton told CNBC on Wednesday the posts have triggered \"a wave of euphoric and speculative buying in the retail (trading) community which is never a good thing\", adding that it was not illegal to say \"I like a stock\".\n\nRetail purchases of GameStop eased to $5.7 million in the previous session from $15.9 million on Tuesday, which was the highest this year, Vanda data showed.\n\nSimilarly, for AMC, daily retail inflows dropped to $7.7 million on Wednesday from $51 million in the previous day.\n\nOther highly shorted stocks that caught a bid this week also fell on Thursday. Tupperware dropped 7% to $1.68, while U.S. listed BlackBerry shed 4.6%.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Unknown On-chain Trader Scores $46 Million Profit on PEPE as Memecoin Surges\n\nAn unidentified trader has raked in a staggering $46 million in profit by investing in the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin. This remarkable achievement represents an astronomical return of 15,718 times the trader's initial investment of $3,000. The trader, whose identity remains a mystery, purchased 4.9 trillion PEPE tokens for a mere $3,000 on April 15, 2023. As of now, this investment is valued at over $56 million. The trader decided to sell 1.41 trillion PEPE tokens, earning a handsome $7.4 million, while still retaining 3.5 trillion PEPE tokens worth a substantial $38.9 million, according to Lookonchain.\n\nPepe currently boasts a market capitalization of $4.5 billion, positioning it as the third-largest memecoin, trailing only Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Over the past seven days, Pepe has experienced a remarkable surge of more than 40%..\n\nInterestingly, the recent rally of Pepe may be linked to the resurgence of the GameStop stock craze. The GameStop stock (GME) began its ascent on May 13, following the unexpected return of Keith Gill, the individual widely credited with initiating the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, after a three-year hiatus from social media.\n\nPEPE achieved a new all-time high of over $0.00001156 on May 15, just days after Gill resurfaced online. Notably, GameStop shares skyrocketed by over 111% within 24 hours of Gill's reappearance, outperforming Bitcoin's annual returns in just a single day. While it remains challenging to predict the start of an all-encompassing memecoin run, some traders speculate that the profits gained from GameStop will flow into alternative cryptocurrencies, mirroring the trend observed during the 2021 bull run.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Floki Inu Surges 17% Following Roaring Kitty's Return Which Saw GME Stock Surge\n\nMemecoins are experiencing a surge once again following the reappearance of Roaring Kitty, a notorious meme influencer. Floki Inu, in particular, has seen a significant boost, with its value increasing as high as 17% in the past 24 hours. Roaring Kitty, also known as Keith Gill and DeepFuckingValue, gained fame as a key figure in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze that captivated the internet. After three years of silence, he made a comeback a few days ago, sharing a series of cryptic videos on Twitter.\n\nThe official Floki Inu Twitter account attributes its recent success directly to Roaring Kitty, stating, \"Floki has always embraced meme culture, positioning itself as one of the leading memecoins in the crypto industry.\" Interestingly, Floki Inu is leading the pack despite Roaring Kitty's video suggesting that it's time to invest in cat coins with the statement, \"the dog days are over.\" Outperforming most non-dog coins in the past 24 hours, including Popcat, cat in a dogs world, and Pepe, Floki Inu stands strong as a coin associated with Elon Musk's dog.\n\nAnother factor contributing to Floki Inu's outperformance may be the recent approval of a DAO proposal that authorized the burning of 15,246,000,000 FLOKI tokens (equivalent to $3,386,773). Token burning often signals bullish sentiment for projects as it reduces the circulating supply while demand remains steady, typically resulting in an increase in token value.\n\nWhile Floki Inu takes the lead, there are a couple of other meme coin tokens that have also outperformed the market in the last 24 hours. GME, a tribute token on Solana for GameStop, has surged by 34%, while Apu Apustaja, another variant of Pepe the Frog, has climbed by 19% during the same period.\n\nView comments",

Cumulatively, traders are now fully pricing in two rate cuts of 25 basis points by year end.\n\nThe rate-sensitive 2-year Treasury yields tumbled to 4.75%, down by 7 basis points, marking a notable break below its 200-day moving average.\n\nThe U.S. dollar fell across the board vis-\u00e0-vis other major currencies, with the greenback losing as much as 1% against the low-yielding Japanese yen.\n\nAmong sectors, both tech and real estate rallied the most, given their high sensitivity to interest rates. Top industry performers were homebuilders, as tracked by the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB), up 3.2%. Chipmakers, as tracked by the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) followed suit, up 2.2%.\n\nSmall caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), also rallied, up by 1%.\n\nMeme-tied stocks, such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Inc. (NYSE:GME), plummeted 23% and 31%, respectively. Wednesday\u2019s negative price actions caused the two stocks to retrace more than half of the wild bullish trend that began on Monday.\n\nIn the commodities space, precious metals soared with gold and silver up 1.3% and 3%, respectively. Crude softened 0.3%.\n\nAmong cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) marked a 5.5% gain.\n\nWednesday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,105.02 1.0% Nasdaq 100 18,496.99 1.0% S&P 500 5,289.66 0.8% Dow Jones 39,746.97 0.5%\n\nUpdated at 12:33 p.m. EDT\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) roared 0.9% to $528.94, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) was 0.6% up to $398.24 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was up 1.2% to $451.04, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the TechnologySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) outperformed, both up by 1.8%.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A raucous two-week stretch for GameStop Corp. has more than tripled its share price, but the company itself hasn\u2019t taken advantage of the surge by selling stock \u2014 and the explanations about why are wide-ranging.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSlovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed How One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies\n\nUnlike AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., a fellow meme stock darling that did cash in as shares spiked, GameStop apparently didn\u2019t have a so-called at-the-market filing in place ahead of the rally which would allow it to sell new shares with no additional paperwork. The retailer also is expected to release quarterly earnings soon, and may have decided it wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t speed up the disclosures the US Securities and Exchange Commission would likely require to sell new stock.\n\nFor companies to set up and sell shares in an ATM offering they \u201cwould need to disclose any material information,\u201d which would include earnings in some capacity, said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. \u201cIf the ATM was already ongoing, since it is up to a broker-dealer to execute the trades rather than the company, there is less disclosure required than if the company tells a broker-dealer to start issuing.\u201d\n\nEven if the regulatory lane was clear, a move for GameStop to sell new shares for the first time since 2021 when it raised more than $1 billion could irk loyal traders who have touted its clean balance sheet, with essentially zero debt and nearly $1 billion in cash, as a reason why the company was a bargain as recently as a week ago.\n\nAMC, by contrast, is negotiating with its creditors to extend obligations. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Kevin Near and Geetha Ranganathan highlighted prior to the company\u2019s debt for equity swap that AMC had $624 million in cash at the end of the first quarter ahead of its $250 million raise, along with roughly $4.5 billion in debt, including a $2.8 billion 2026 maturity wall.\n\nRead More: GameStop Soars as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Retail Frenzy\n\nThe bullish case for GameStop investors is currently \u201call on the momo meme trade, which perhaps still has legs,\u201d said investment research firm Hedgeye\u2019s Jeremy McLean, who warned that a \u201cnear best case scenario is already priced in in terms of fundamentals.\u201d\n\nGameStop and Ryan Cohen, its chief executive officer and largest shareholder, face a difficult turnaround on the horizon as gamers have largely switched to downloading new titles rather than shopping at brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeculative Rebound\n\nWhile GameStop stock remains down nearly 70% from a 2021 peak, a 226% surge to start May has positioned it to capitalize on a rebound across speculative corners of the market.\n\nStill, the moment for inundating the market with new shares can be fleeting. As of 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, the stock had peeled back 44% from a Tuesday intraday high of $64.83.\n\nAMC was well-positioned for a rally. The movie-theater chain\u2019s at-the-market deal was lined up in March, enabling it to sell $250 million worth of shares through Monday\u2019s surge. It then announced a debt-for-equity swap that further diluted investors while helping address its billions in debt.\n\nRead More: AMC Seizes on Meme Stock Moves to Cut $164 Milllion of Debt\n\nB. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold highlighted that AMC has about 191 million shares authorized that have not yet been issued.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear precisely when GameStop would be able to sell shares, if it chooses to. The company has historically released first-quarter results in the first half of June before an annual meeting of investors and has not formally set an earnings date. A GameStop representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA key part of GameStop\u2019s attraction has been the aura surrounding Cohen as a champion of the meme crowd, and the company\u2019s strategy now includes Cohen using its cash to invest in equities.\n\nGameStop selling its own stock may signal to meme investors that the company is admitting it\u2019d be timely to cash in, according to Wedbush\u2019s Michael Pachter, one of the company\u2019s most vocal skeptics.\n\n\u201cIf they issue shares, they think the price is pretty compelling,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits The DNA Test Delusion US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports Silicon Valley Is Searching for Its Piece of the AI Action\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop and AMC shares tank after hopes of a 2021-style meme stock revival are shattered",
        "content": "Shares for the movie theater company and for the video game retailer fell 21% and 27%, respectively, as of Wednesday afternoon following a revival of meme stock mania that had sent shares of both companies skyrocketing in recent days. Another meme stock, Blackberry, fell 9% on Wednesday. This is amid all-time highs for the market.\n\nThe leader of the 2021 meme stock frenzy, day trader Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty on X and DeepF\u2014ingValue on Reddit, returned to social media on Sunday after a multi-year hiatus. On Monday, Gill\u2019s favorite trade, GameStop, started to climb and reached a peak of $64.83 on Tuesday, up from an intraday high of $20.20 on Friday.\n\nOther day trader darlings, such as AMC and Blackberry, also came back to life this week riding a resurgence in meme stocks that was encouraged by members of Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets forum. AMC shot up to as high as $11.88 on Tuesday, up from an intraday high of $3.19 on Friday. Blackberry reached a high of $3.85 on Tuesday compared to an intraday high of $3.08 on Friday.\n\nStill, the rally was stifled by news that AMC was taking advantage of its stock resurgence to secure new financing through a deal that dilutes investors\u2019 shares.\n\nThe fall from grace shattered hopes of a meme stock revival just as two major indices, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, advanced 1% and 1.1%, respectively, to hit all-time highs on Wednesday. Fueling the rise were better-than-expected inflation numbers. The consumer price index of 0.3% for the month of April came in cooler than the 0.4% consensus estimate.\n\nThe S&P 500, which reflects the broader market, is up about 10% since January as investors are betting that the Fed will lower interest rates later this year.\n\nUnlike the meme stocks, other favorite asset classes for day traders have performed well this year. After the SEC approved a dozen Bitcoin-tracking ETFs in January, billions of dollars have flowed to the financial vehicles. Bitcoin, in turn, notched an all-time-high in March and was trading up 46% year-to-date at $64,000 as of Wednesday. Gold has also hit several all-time-highs this year and was trading up 14% year-to-date as of Wednesday.\n\nOn Twitter, investing enthusiasts lamented GameStop and AMC\u2019s declines, with some, as in 2021, putting the blame on financial institutions and bankers.\n\n\u201cBuy $AMC & $GME, these companies deemed \u201cmeme stocks\u201d target the very worst market fraudsters the world has to offer,\u201d one trader wrote on X.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop, AMC Shares Drop as Week\u2019s $11 Billion Rally Cools",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- This week\u2019s renewed frenzy around meme-stock favorites GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. cooled off a bit Wednesday, with shares of the high-risk, heavily shorted companies giving up most of their premarket gains.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow One of the World's Oldest Hedge Funds Went Bankrupt Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market Biden Accuses China of \u2018Cheating\u2019 on Trade, Imposes New Tariffs OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever Is Leaving the Company\n\nThe two stocks were about 9% higher at 5:55 a.m. in New York. Earlier Wednesday, video-game retailer GameStop surged as much as 32% while beleaguered movie theater chain AMC jumped as much as 35%. The companies more than doubled over the first two days of the week, adding a combined $11 billion in market value.\n\nThe stocks \u2014 which remain far below their all-time highs \u2014 are on track for their biggest monthly gains since the first half of 2021, when the meme-stock mania first swept through markets.\n\nThe conditions that drove the surge in stock prices then are no longer present, so this time around the rally may not last as long, said Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro.\n\n\u201cThis time it is different,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic lockdown is over. Excess consumer savings are largely long spent. Short positions in these stocks are much smaller though not small. Interest rates are much higher.\u201d\n\nSocial media posts this week by Keith Gill, who drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 under the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d made for effective kindling for this latest rally. Gill shot to fame that year by rallying day traders on Reddit in an effort to squeeze GameStop short sellers.\n\nTraders betting against some of the most heavily shorted stocks are racking up big paper losses. Bearish bets on the pair have lost more than $1.3 billion in mark-to-market losses this month: GameStop shorts lost $1.24 billion in May, while AMC shorts lost around $126 million, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.\n\nMeanwhile, option activity on GameStop continued to surge Tuesday, with total trading volume hitting their highest level since June 2022, and almost 820,000 contracts traded. Put volume soared to more than 10 times the 20-day average and exceeded call volume.\n\nThis week\u2019s rally also boosted other high-risk and heavily shorted stocks as traders looked to stocks beyond GameStop and AMC. Some of this week\u2019s big winners include BlackBerry Ltd., SunPower Corp. and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC and GameStop were among the top 10 securities bought by retail investors Tuesday, with respectively $51 million and $16 million daily inflows, said Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data at Vanda Research.\n\nBearish news on the consumer price index Wednesday in the US may prompt investors to pull back from risky bets such as those they\u2019re making on the meme stocks, he said.\n\n\u201cOverall, the likelihood of this meme rally persisting will depend on the CPI print today,\u201d said Pierantoni, adding that a \u201crisk-off event will scare retail traders off and push purchases back into traditional products,\u201d while a softer reading on inflation \u201cwill probably generate another leg higher.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\n(Updates stock move.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges Elon Musk\u2019s Big AI Contradiction\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors Are Pouring Into These Gaming And Retail ETFs On Gamestop's Latest Run\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) is once again sending shockwaves through the markets, with investors rushing to capitalize on the sudden surge in the gaming retailer\u2019s stock price. As a result, several gaming and retail Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have experienced a significant spike in trading volume as investors seek to ride the wave of the meme stock phenomenon.\n\nOne of the most notable beneficiaries of the GameStop frenzy is the YieldMax Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:ULTY). Despite a 2.09% price decline on Tuesday, the fund saw an astounding increase in trading volume, with 1,608,264 shares traded compared to its average volume of 269,819. The ETF, which employs both traditional and synthetic covered call strategies to generate higher income levels during periods of market volatility, has gained attention due to its exposure to select U.S.-listed securities, including GameStop.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) also experienced a massive surge in trading volume on Tuesday, with 28,165,621 shares traded, dwarfing its average volume of 6,318,955. The fund, which seeks to track the performance of the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, saw a 2.84% increase in price on Tuesday. With a substantial portion of its total assets invested in securities comprising the index, the ETF has become a popular choice for investors looking to gain exposure to the retail segment of the S&P Total Market Index.\n\nA lesser-known ETF that has benefited from the GameStop craze is the Amplify Video Game Tech ETF (NYSE:GAMR). The fund, which invests at least 80% of its net assets in companies primarily engaged in supporting or utilizing the video gaming industry, saw its trading volume nearly triple on Tuesday, with 4,929 shares traded compared to its average volume of 1,657. The ETF also experienced a 5.11% price increase, highlighting the growing interest in the video game sector amidst the meme stock resurgence.\n\nThe recent spike in trading volume for these gaming and retail ETFs can be attributed to the renewed interest in GameStop, sparked by the return of \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d a key figure in the 2021 meme stock short squeeze, and the social media buzz generated by controversial figure Andrew Tate. As individual investors, often communicating through online forums like Reddit, rush to buy GameStop shares, the demand for ETFs with exposure to the gaming retailer and the broader retail sector has skyrocketed.\n\nAn Alternative Fund Capturing Long-Term Trends\n\nWhile the meme stock phenomenon has captured the attention of investors worldwide, it is essential to recognize the risks associated with such highly volatile investments. For those seeking more stable, long-term growth opportunities, an alternative like Cityfunds may be worth considering.\n\nStory continues\n\nCityfunds offers investors the chance to own fractional shares of high-quality homes in top-performing cities across the United States. By investing in a diversified portfolio of carefully selected properties, investors can potentially benefit from the appreciation of the real estate market without the extreme volatility associated with meme stocks.\n\nWith a low minimum investment and a user-friendly platform, Cityfunds makes it accessible for a wide range of investors to build wealth through real estate. The experienced team at Cityfunds handles all management aspects, allowing investors to enjoy passive income and long-term growth potential without the day-to-day responsibilities of direct property ownership.\n\nClick here to visit the Cityfunds website and invest in your favorite cities.\n\nAs the GameStop craze continues to drive investor interest in gaming and retail ETFs, it is crucial for individuals to carefully consider their risk tolerance and long-term financial goals. While the potential for rapid gains may be tempting, the stability and consistent growth offered by real estate investments like Cityfunds can provide a more reliable path to building lasting wealth in an uncertain market.\n\nThis article Investors Are Pouring Into These Gaming And Retail ETFs On Gamestop's Latest Run originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nView comments",

Here Are 2 ETFs To Ride The Latest Wave\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMeme stocks are, once again, taking center stage following the return of Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d to social media after a nearly three-year hiatus. Gill, a central figure in the meme stock phenomenon that rocked the market in early 2021, has reignited interest in these volatile yet potentially lucrative investments.\n\nGameStop Inc. (NASDAQ:GME), the struggling video game retailer at the heart of the meme stock frenzy, witnessed a staggering 60.1% gain on Tuesday, closing at $48.75 after hitting a high of $64.83 earlier in the day. This surge comes on the heels of Gill\u2019s recent social media post, which has garnered over 19 million views and sparked a viral reaction among investors.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), another prominent meme stock, also experienced significant gains, rising 31.98% on Tuesday. The renewed interest in meme stocks has investors wondering if this is the beginning of another wild ride.\n\nFor those looking to capitalize on the latest meme stock wave, two Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) stand out as potential vehicles:\n\nSchwab Crypto Thematic ETF (NYSE:STCE)\n\nThe Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF gained 3.96% on Tuesday, benefiting from its unique blend of investments in key cryptocurrency companies and meme-related stocks. By combining digital finance with viral market trends, this ETF offers exposure to the dynamic world of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies.\n\nTop holdings in the fund include MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), CleanSpark, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLSK), and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA). GameStop also features in the fund\u2019s portfolio, with a weight of 1.96%.\n\nAmplify Video Game Tech ETF (NYSE:GAMR)\n\nThe Amplify Video Game Tech ETF, which gained 5.11% on Tuesday, is another option for investors seeking exposure to meme stocks. The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in companies primarily engaged in supporting or utilizing the video gaming industry.\n\nTop holdings include GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), Bilibili Inc (NASDAQ:BILI), and Embracer Group AB (EMBRACB SS). GameStop alone accounts for 5.29% of the fund\u2019s market value, making it a significant player in the ETF\u2019s performance.\n\nWhile meme stocks offer the potential for rapid gains, investors should be aware of the risks associated with these highly volatile investments. Unlike traditional stocks, which are influenced by fundamental analysis and corporate performance, meme stocks are often subject to rapid price changes driven by hype and mass trading actions.\n\nStory continues\n\nTargeting More Sustainable, Long-Term Gains\n\nFor those seeking more reliable long-term gains, an investment like Cityfunds may be a more suitable option. Cityfunds offers investors the opportunity to own fractional shares of high-quality homes in top-performing cities across the United States. By investing in a diversified portfolio of carefully selected properties, investors can benefit from the potential appreciation of the real estate market without the volatility associated with meme stocks.\n\nWith a low minimum investment of $500 and a user-friendly platform, Cityfunds makes it easy for investors to build wealth through real estate. The experienced team at Cityfunds handles all management aspects, allowing investors to enjoy passive income and long-term growth potential without the hassles of direct property ownership.\n\nClick here to explore the cities you can invest in through Cityfunds. \r\nAs the meme stock phenomenon reignites, investors must carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before diving in. While ETFs like STCE and GAMR offer exposure to this exciting market segment, more risk-averse investors may find greater peace of mind and stability in real estate investments like Cityfunds. Ultimately, a well-diversified portfolio that balances high-risk, high-reward investments with more stable, long-term growth opportunities may be the key to financial success in these unpredictable times.\n\nThis article Are Meme Stocks Ready To Rip Again?

The legendary investor said he sold calls and puts on the poster children of the meme stock mania, as the shares of both companies take off with speculators using the retail trader favorites as a way to treat the stock market as a casino.\n\nIn a critique of the latest trading flurry, in which GameStop has soared 179% in two days while AMC has jumped 135%, Gross posted on X that \u201cGamestonk\u201d is passe. \u201cBuy? Sell? Not me,\u201d he wrote on the social media platform Tuesday.\n\nHis strategy centers on selling what he describes as \u201c400% annualized volatility.\u201d\n\nThe trade was to sell GameStop $40 calls and puts \u2014 known as a straddle \u2014 betting that the stock won\u2019t swing too far in either direction. He collected $22 for the combination of options, allowing him to profit if the stock is between $18 and $62 at the close Friday, standing to gain the most if shares end up near $40. He\u2019s used a similar strategy on AMC, selling $10 straddles.\n\nGameStop shares closed at closed at $48.75 after soaring as high as $64.83, while AMC ended the session at $6.85 after opening at $11.88.\n\nThe trade comes about seven weeks after Gross sold options underlying former president Donald Trump\u2019s media firm. At the time, Gross was betting that Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. would stay between $45 and $95. Shares dropped as low as $22.55 a few weeks later before staging a rally to $53.40 as of Tuesday\u2019s close. Gross said he\u2019s out of that position.\n\nThe latest mania has spread to many of Wall Street\u2019s most hated stocks, reminiscent of 2021\u2019s meme stock craze, when individual investors railed against short-sellers on forums like Reddit Inc.\u2019s WallStreetBets and the chatroom StockTwits. The surge caught the attention of a smattering of social-media personalties including Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy who piled into the stocks.\n\nEven with the rallies, however, GameStop\u2019s stock remains roughly 60% below its intraday peak while some AMC investors are sitting on paper losses greater than 98%.

        "content": "Donald Trump's Truth Social Shows 55% Increase In Site Traffic Since IPO As Stock Rockets 123% From Lows Amid Short Squeeze Speculation\n\nTruth Social, through its public entity Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT), has been on an incredibly volatile run since officially going public in March. Following its IPO, the company reached highs of $79.38 before going on a monthlong sell-off to $22.55. The stock has since rallied as much as 138% since its lows, closing at over $54 last Thursday before taking a breather down to $50.99 on Friday.\n\nThe volatility is attributed to two factors. The initial downfall was from an objectively overvalued valuation following its IPO. At its high, the company was valued at over $8 billion. Despite this, the company only had $751k in revenue for the quarter ending in December while sitting on a $9 million loss. The Axios estimates Truth Social has roughly five million monthly active users.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nStartup behind \u2018the #1 free contractor app' grows 162% YoY, opens its doors for investors at a $100 minimum. Invest in time-tested solution that aims to solve this $600 billion women\u2019s health problem at 80 cents per share.\n\nComparatively, Reddit Inc. (NYSE:RDDT) is also currently worth about $8 billion, but its recent quarter showed $249 million in revenue and $18.53 million in net income. Recent estimates put Reddit at 73 million monthly active users.\n\nBy several metrics, Truth Social is objectively overvalued hence the initial nearly 80% drop in the company. Like many initial public offerings, companies will rise fast as investors flock to acquire a stake in the company. This often creates an initial steep rise in the stock, which causes short-term investors to flood the stock hoping to make money on its way up, just as happened with DJT.\n\nAn inflated valuation coupled with those same short-term investors selling off caused the initial sell-off. Another huge factor was a swath of investors opening massive short positions on the company. An inflated valuation coupled with an army of political dissidents caused a swath of investors to line up and open massive short positions on the company.\n\nTrending: Invest like a millionaire. Exclusive opportunity to invest in Epic Games $17 billion gaming empire.\n\nWhen investors open short positions on a company, they sell the stock first causing the price to go down. As it drops, they make money when they buy the stock back. When a lot of investors short a stock, it will cause a short-term price decline, but those same investors eventually need to buy the stock back. If the stock doesn't decline, shorts can be open to unlimited liability as the price climbs, eventually resulting in the account being margin-called and the broker requires the account to purchase the stock back. This is what's called a \"short squeeze.'\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable names like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) were notably a part of short squeezes from early to mid-2021 causing their stock to rocket over 1500%.\n\nDJT has begun using these same tactics intentionally in an attempt to keep its stock price afloat and is likely a contributing factor in the recent climb from its yearly lows. DJT's CEO, Devin Nunes, has begun issuing statements blaming the decline on short selling, telling shareholders how to lock up their shares, sending letters to Congress calling for an investigation, and informing the Nasdaq of suspected stock manipulation from naked short selling.\n\nAccording to Webull, as of April 30, there were 5.35 million shares sold short and growing. At its current share price, that means $272 million in stock is currently being sold short and will eventually need to be bought back. The short interest has doubled since February and continuing to climb.\n\nAnother contributing factor could be the increased attention and underlying growth of the platform itself, however. In February, Truth Social had roughly five million website visits according to SimilarWeb. In March, the same month as the DJT's initial public offering, the company grew over 55% to 7.74 million visitors. In April, it declined to 6.5 million which is still a 30% growth from February. With more publicity from Trump's ongoing trial and the upcoming election, the platform could see a continued surge of users from the ongoing bouts of publicity.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

        "content": "Wall Street Trades Flat On Mixed Producer Inflation; Meme Stocks See Wild Ride, Bitcoin Drops: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?\n\nWall Street is experiencing a subdued trading session, with all major indices showing minimal movement around midday in New York. The latest producer inflation data provided mixed signals ahead of the highly anticipated consumer inflation report on Wednesday.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his outlook that U.S. monetary policy will maintain its current rate for a longer period than previously anticipated, dismissing fears of new rate hikes.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced significant tariffs on Chinese imports, imposing 25% on steel and aluminum, 100% on electric vehicles made in China, 25% on EV batteries, and a 50% tariff on semiconductors from China.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index (DXY), the\u00a0Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), fell 0.2% negatively reacting to producer inflation readings and Powell\u2019s remarks.\n\nTreasury yields slightly softened, with traders holding expectations of two Fed rate cuts by year-end.\n\nAll major indices such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq 100 traded broadly flat for the day.\n\nSmall caps, as tracked by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM), rallied 0.8%, on track to notch the highest close since early April.\n\nMomentum on meme stocks continued to remain wild, with shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC) up 22% and 18%, respectively.\n\nIn the commodities market, gold rose 0.8% while oil prices fell 1.4% on concerns that some OPEC+ members want to raise output.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) fell 2.5% to $61,400.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Performance In Major U.S. Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,082.41 0.8% Nasdaq 100 18,200.03 0.0% Dow Jones 39,393.40 -0.1% S&P 500 5,215.80 -0.1%\n\nUpdated as of 1:12 p.m. EDT\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was flat at $520.94, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) was flat at $394.37 and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was up 0.1% to $443.41, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nSector-wise, the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) outperformed, up 0.5%. The Consumer StaplesSelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) was the major laggard, down 0.6%.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nShares of InsuletCorp. (NASDAQ:PODD) were up by 4.6% on Tuesday, even though short-seller Blue Orca Capital announced it had taken a short position in the company\u2019s stock. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) soared over 20% following the announcement that it secured a $1.66 billion government loan to support its clean hydrogen projects, leading to the stock\u2019s most significant single-day gain in seven years. SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ:SPWR) rallied 44%, buoyed by the meme-stock frenzy. Delcath Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:DCTH) rose over 30% in reaction to the company\u2019s quarterly results.

        "content": "No matter which side you were on during the initial meme stock mania in 2021, we can all agree on one thing \u2013 the market felt like the Wild West out there.\n\nOut of the bunch, GameStop GME was the most popular, shaking the market violently with a short squeeze of a magnitude rarely seen.\n\nOf course, other meme stocks, including AMC Entertainment AMC, also became a nightmare for short-sellers, causing violent price swings.\n\nAnd as we\u2019re all aware, they\u2019re back. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each in May. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the mania.\n\nRoaring Kitty Returns\n\nRoaring Kitty (Keith Gill) was the prominent figure in the initial 2021 meme craze, helping kick off the period by shifting attention toward short sellers. An epic short squeeze ensued in GameStop shares, with other heavily-shorted stocks, such as AMC Entertainment, also causing pain for short sellers.\n\nAfter January 2021 was over, GME shares closed up more than 1500%.\n\nThe excitement subsided over the years until \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 recently made a social media post, breaking three years of silence. Meme-stock traders clearly heard the call, with GME shares up 350% in May alone.\n\nGameStop\u2019s Current Standing\n\nGameStop recently reported quarterly results, falling short of our consensus EPS estimate by 12% and posting sales 10% below expectations. Earnings saw modest growth, whereas sales declined 20% year-over-year.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company\u2019s outlook has shifted lower across the board, with the stock presently carrying a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A short squeeze has fueled the recent melt-up, certainly not reflective of the company\u2019s current earnings outlook. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOnce heavily-shorted stocks begin rising, it kicks off a vicious cycle for shorts, who are forced to cover their positions and buy back the shares they borrowed. This leads to massive losses for shorts that cannot cover their positions, while traders enjoy the rollercoaster.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what happened in 2021 with meme stocks such as GameStop GME and AMC Entertainment AMC. And it's happening again.\n\nFrom a trading standpoint, the volatility of these stocks is a dream.\n\nBut for investors, it\u2019s crucial to focus on solid business fundamentals rather than one-day price swings.\n\nIt raises a valid question \u2013 will short sellers continue to be caught off guard?\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders betting against some of the most heavily-shorted stocks are racking up paper losses in an unexpected revival of the meme trade this week.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Biden Adds Tariffs on Chinese Chips, Critical Minerals, EVs Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\n\nA Goldman Sachs basket that simultaneously goes long on the stocks most favored by hedge funds and bets against the 50 most-shorted stocks has fallen roughly 13% over the past two sessions \u2014 on track for its worst two-day slump since the height of the retail-trading frenzy in 2021.\n\nUnderscoring the performance was a surge in the stocks once popular with the day-trading crowd including GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. The heavily-shorted names extended gains on Tuesday after each jumped more than 70% in the prior session, leading a rally in companies with high short interest.\n\nBearish bets on the pair have lost more than $1 billion in mark-to-market losses this month: GameStop shorts lost $1.24 million in May, while AMC shorts lost around $126 million, according to data from S3 Partners LLC.\n\nMost of the losses incurred by short sellers on the meme stocks\u2019 spikes happened in the last two sessions.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s losses will put a lot of short sellers on tilt and squeeze them out of their positions,\u201d Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners LLC wrote in a report Tuesday.

The surge in meme stocks also likely set up a gamma squeeze, that occurs when price increases spur traders to buy call options, forcing market makers to buy the underlying stock and sending shares even higher.\n\nHeavily-shorted stocks continued to rally in Tuesday trading with the ebullience spreading beyond the most popular retail favorites. SunPower Corp. gained 92%, an intraday record, while BlackBerry Ltd. and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. traded as much as 24% and 36% higher, respectively. The former president\u2019s media company Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., a newly minted retail favorite, advanced by a more modest 6.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: SunPower Stock Soars on Meme Frenzy as Short Interest Mounts\n\nShares of GameStop more than doubled at the market open, touching levels not seen since 2021, while AMC rose as much as 129%.\n\nThe volatile trading stands to encourage more short sellers to step into meme names. Still, AMC and GameStop remain far below their 2021 peaks, as do other names with high short interest.\n\n\u201cThe meme trade is back and short sellers in stocks like GME, AMC and DJT will be teetering on the short squeeze cliff as their stock prices surge,\u201d said Dusaniwsky.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits How the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The stock market is having a sleepy trading session Tuesday ahead of Wednesday\u2019s critical inflation data. But in the more obscure, speculative corners of the investing world the casino is rocking.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind Biden Accuses China of \u2018Cheating\u2019 on Trade, Imposes New Tariffs Macron Puts French Banks in Play With Plan to Transform Europe Flood of China Used Cooking Oil Spurs Call to Hike US Levies Five Under-the-Radar Billionaires Making Vast Fortunes in Modi's India\n\nMeme stock darling GameStop Corp. is up 171% in just two days, and beleaguered movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. has soared 135%. Over 1 billion AMC shares have traded on Monday and Tuesday, compared with 24 million on Friday. Meanwhile, GameStop\u2019s volume is over 340 million in the past two sessions, up from roughly 37 million on Friday.\n\nFor its part, the S&P 500 Index is basically unchanged since Friday and its volume in Tuesday\u2019s session is 21% below its 20-day average as investors await Wednesday\u2019s crucial consumer price index data.\n\nThe mania, which has spread to many of Wall Street\u2019s most hated stocks, has shades of 2021\u2019s meme stock craze, when cooped-up individual investors railed against short-selling hedge funds on forums like Reddit Inc.\u2019s WallStreetBets and the chatroom StockTwits. But that was three years ago. Wall Street has since gotten privy to how these \u201cReddit Raiders\u201d operate and created a blueprint to profit.\n\nStrategies that use algorithms to capture price momentum are now better positioned to jump on these rallies before they go mainstream. They can even add a little juice to the surges.\n\n\u201cA part of the industry is much more well-prepared for meme rallies and to take advantage of those meme rallies than when they were surprised three years ago,\u201d said Don Steinbrugge, head of Agecroft Partners, which helps hedge funds raise money. \u201cThey want to get in on the beginning of the price movement, and they want to get out before the price collapses. They basically want to front-run the buying and selling of retail investors.\u201d\n\nCasino Abuzz\n\nThe latest chapter in the meme-stock craze began with a single cryptic post on X Sunday night from Keith Gill, the retail-trading icon who goes by the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d and drove the original mania before disappearing from social media in June 2021. By early Monday morning, the market casino was abuzz with amateur and professional investors placing bets across the speculative world.\n\nTrading data from providers that cater to individual investors seems to validate Wall Street\u2019s role in the latest move. Since Gill\u2019s tweet went viral, users of Fidelity\u2019s platform have actually placed more sell orders than buy shares, the company\u2019s website shows, something that didn\u2019t happen during the 2021 stretch when individuals were overwhelmingly net buyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: GameStop Stock Surge Is a Long Way From 2021\u2019s Meme-Stock Frenzy\n\nInvestors that have been nimble \u2014 and lucky \u2014 have seen massive gains. But others who embrace the \u201cHODL\u201d motto, short for \u201chold on for dear life,\u201d are still in the red. GameStop is roughly 60% below its 2021 intraday peak while AMC is down 98% from a high. The massive paper losses could be a reason for some to finally cash out, according to Dan Egan, vice president of behavioral finance and investing at robo-adviser Betterment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very different, latent set of retail traders waiting to see certain price points just to sell out which we didn\u2019t have last time,\u201d said Dan Egan, vice president of behavioral finance and investing at robo-adviser Betterment. They dynamic could drive the cycle of the trade, he added.\n\nA smattering of social-media personalities have helped draw in uninformed retail traders to the casino, furthering the notion that trading meme stocks is just a form of gambling.\n\nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy has resumed his \u201cDavey Day Trader\u201d livestream, and on Tuesday morning talked about buying $500,000 worth of GameStop and AMC. Influencer Andrew Tate, who is charged with human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, is constantly posting on X about buying GameStop. And social media influencers that were accused of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme have reawakened some of the animal spirits around AMC.\n\nMeme Risk\n\nStrategists like Egan warn retail traders to not buy stocks based on memes. Especially because the very groups touting shares are likely to quietly cash out while everyone else is buying.\n\nThen, there are the trading platforms such as Robinhood Markets Inc. and market-making firms like Citadel Securities that will profit either way. Robinhood\u2019s commission-free trading is partly driven by its ability to make money through transactions in what\u2019s called payment for order flow. The money maker is controversial because brokerages get paid by market makers to route orders through them, rather than directly to stock exchanges.\n\nThose market makers and brokers can make even more on equity options contracts given bid-ask spreads are typically wider than those on regular stock trades. Meaning the firms throughout the cycle of completing trades can profit handsomely from a boom in volume, regardless of how the companies do. So the soaring activity in GameStop and AMC, paired a boom in trading of options tied to both companies, means the market makers and options brokers are sitting pretty.\n\nNot everyone is making money, however. Investors sticking to short positions in the meme stocks are facing more than a billion dollars in paper losses. That said, those numbers pale in comparison to the pain from three years ago that resulted in the implosion of firms that ran against the trend, like Gabe Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital. This time around, most hedge funds are adopting strategies to limit their exposure.\n\n\u201cA big change since last time is that a number of managers have changed their risk controls on the short side so they won\u2019t get burned as bad,\u201d Agecroft\u2019s Steinbrugge said.\n\n--With assistance from Hema Parmar.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits US East Coast Ports Are Spending Billions to Profit From Asia\u2019s Shifting Exports Cheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Meme stocks are shaking Wall Street once again. That shouldn't be much of a surprise.\n\nEver since bands of smaller-pocketed and novice investors began taking stock prices of downtrodden companies to breathtaking heights three years ago, the potential for more flareups has been obvious.\n\nSome things are different this time. The biggest change from the initial supernova for GameStop's stock is how the experience of 2021 makes this all feel familiar. That familiarity, plus some changes in the market, should allow Wall Street to more easily digest the movements without danger to the overall system, experts say.\n\nGameStop in 2021 put securities markets' capacity and resilience to a test that \"few could have anticipated,\" the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a report later that year.\n\nBut some things remain firmly the same. Chief among them is the risk of losing everything that accompanies the potential to make fast money playing such volatile stocks. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s going on:\n\n___\n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING?\n\nGameStop, the granddaddy of meme stocks, has soared suddenly and sharply. It was nearly 37% higher Tuesday afternoon after surging 74% the day before. Other meme stocks from the pandemic era are moving just as radically. AMC Entertainment, the movie theater operator, jumped nearly 31% Tuesday.\n\nSHOULD THEY BE RISING THAT FAST?\n\nFinancial analysts and professional investors who care mostly about numbers like profits, cash flow and interest rates would say no. GameStop's financial prospects did not change over the weekend, before the dizzying ascent of its stock price. The video-game retailer did post a small profit in its most recent fiscal year following five years of big losses and substantial cost and job cuts.\n\nTHEN WHAT TRIGGERED IT?\n\nA burst of momentum brought on by buyers. Conventional wisdom says a stock should eventually settle at a price that reflects how much cash the company is generating, where interest rates are heading and other factors. But in the short term, what sets a stock's price is how much investors are willing to pay for it. And, for the moment at least, people are willing to pay much higher prices for shares of GameStop.\n\nYOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY ROARING KITTY THERE, NO?\n\nYes, the spark that got the momentum rolling may have been a person who goes by the nickname Roaring Kitty. He was a central character in the initial surge for GameStop, famous for wearing a red bandana and talking bluntly. He rallied other buyers as he professed on Youtube, Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and even in testimony before Congress how much he liked the stock. GameStop\u2019s stock price shot up more than 1,700% through the first few weeks of January 2021,\n\nStory continues\n\nWHAT DID ROARING KITTY DO THIS TIME?\n\nAfter laying dormant since June 18, 2021, the X account for TheRoaringKitty posted a meme Sunday evening. The picture shows a person playing a video game going from a lounging position to upright and alert. Many users on social media took it as a signal, and forums were soon buzzing with people saying they were buying GameStop. That quickly gave way to screenshots that people said showed how much profit they were making by trading GameStop.\n\nHOW CAN THE REACTION HAVE BEEN SO QUICK?\n\nThis is the new age of investing, one where anyone can buy a stock with zero commissions simply by tapping a few times on a phone. It's the culmination of years of innovation. At each step of the way, consumer advocates hailed the broadening playing field, which allowed more people to invest in stocks and build wealth. But they also warned that easy access could encourage people to trade too quickly or too rashly.\n\nHOW MUCH REACTION HAS THERE BEEN, REALLY? IT'S ALL AN EXAGERRATION?\n\nIt's been manic. GameStop's share price was swinging so sharply after the opening bell Monday that trading in the stock was halted nine times in just over an hour. On Tuesday, the movements for AMC Entertainment were even wilder, and its trading was halted 18 times by early afternoon.\n\nHOW DOES THAT COMPARE WITH 2021?\n\nIt's not as big. On Monday, investors pumped a net $15.8 million into GameStop, along with $37.5 million into AMC, according to data from Vanda Research. That compares with $87.5 million and $170 million, respectively, in 2021.\n\n\u201cDo we think more retail traders can jump in on the trend in the coming days? Yes,\u201d according to Marco Iachini, senior vice president at Vanda Research. \u201cDo we think this is a repeat of 2021? No, and the chances we reach that stage are low.\u201d\n\nBig hedge funds and other professional investing firms are better equipped to handle the situation this time around, he said, and they could be riding the wave higher with small-time investors before trying to exit the trades before them, which could leave those smaller-pocketed investors holding the risk.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS DIFFERENT?\n\nMeme-stock companies have more shares trading in the market than they did in 2021, which could lessen the chances of what's called a \u201cshort squeeze,\u201d according to Nick Battista, director of market intelligence at tastylive, a streaming network geared toward options traders.\n\nA short squeeze is a relatively rare event that can yield eye-popping profits for people riding the wave. When investors bet a stock's price will go down in the future, they \u201cshort\u201d it by borrowing shares and selling them. Later, if the price does indeed fall, the short sellers can buy the stock, return the borrowed shares and pocket the difference.\n\nBut when a highly shorted stock rises in price quickly, short sellers could scramble to get out of their trades. They can do that only by buying shares of the stock, which can set off a self-feeding cycle that makes the price shoot even higher.\n\nSuch a short squeeze likely contributed to GameStop's thrilling ascent in 2021, but the SEC\"s staff said it was a small fraction of the overall purchases and that GameStop's stock stayed high even after short sellers had gotten out of their trades.\n\nGameStop in March had roughly 305.9 million shares of its stock trading in the market, more than four times the number of shares it had in March 2021. Such growth \u201cgreatly increases the amount of activity needed to squeeze higher\" for GameStop and other meme stocks, Battista said. \u201cCan they move higher? Sure, but it\u2019s going to be a tougher task this time around.\u201d\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF JOINING IN?\n\nIt's important to know the momentum can shift just as suddenly the other way. It took just four weeks in 2021 for GameStop's stock to go from less than $5 to more than $120. But it has yet to touch that price again. Even after its big jump in recent days, GameStop shares can still be bought for around $42.\n\nOr, just look at Tuesday's trading. GameStop quickly more than doubled in the morning, topping $64, before paring much of the gains in afternoon trading and regressing to $41.67.\n\nAfter briefly reaching $390 during the summer of 2021, AMC's stock was drifting below $3 last week. It's now close to $7.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) are soaring again, with both stocks up more than 100% in the past week.\n\nWhile the moves are sending vibrations through the market that feel like the 2021 meme stock mania, Wall Street strategists say this fresh burst of enthusiasm is far from the madness of three years ago.\n\nIn a research note on Tuesday, Vanda Research senior vice president Marco Iachini wrote his team believes further retail interest could pour into the names over the next several trading sessions, but the chances of a 2021 repeat are \"low.\"\n\n\"Quant/hedge funds are much better equipped to handle these situations nowadays,\" Iachini wrote. \"If anything, we believe the chances that they participate along with retail in the squeeze but also lean against and then exit these trades ahead of retail traders are high.\"\n\nThe moves higher in both stocks, which have since been followed by several trading halts and subsequent paring of gains Tuesday, came after the reemergence of Keith Gill, also known as \"Roaring Kitty,\" whose bull case on GameStop ignited the meme stock rally back in 2021.\n\nBut at this stage, the market action is still a far cry from the level of retail inflows seen in 2021. On Monday, GameStop saw net inflows of $15.8 million, while AMC attracted $37.5 million, per VandaTrack data. In January 2021, the peak inflows in a day were $87.5 million and $170 million for GameStop and AMC, respectively.\n\n\"Both stocks have seen a surge in inflows, but the magnitude remains just a fraction of what we witnessed in early 2021,\" Iachini wrote.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek, noted the differences between this meme market moment and 2021.\n\n\"Retail traders are not just sitting at home with little to do aside from trade stocks,\" Colas wrote. \"The Federal government has not just air dropped trillions of stimulus money. Yes, we\u2019re sure that we will hear more about meme stocks in the weeks to come, but not with the same fervor as 3 years ago.\" GameStop, AMC, Reddit, Robinhood, WallStreetBets, Stock Graphs and logos photographed off Apple devices. (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx) (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\nWith other stocks also joining in the rally, such as Sunpower (SPWR), which shot up more than 80% on Tuesday amid a short squeeze, the looming question for investors is whether this risk-on environment will proliferate through the market and create a bubble-like atmosphere.\n\nColas reasons we're not near that level as of now.\n\n\"Every bull market has its share of excess, but this only becomes dangerous when it becomes widespread. Examples would be dot com stocks in the late 1990s and speculative small caps in 2021,\" Colas wrote. \"The flurry of activity around GME today is normal, even if it calls back to prior market silliness.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCapital Economics chief markets economist John Higgins agreed this doesn't look like the prior bubbles.\n\n\"Even if interest in \u2018meme\u2019 stocks rebounds following a renewed surge in GameStop\u2019s share price, some of the telltale signs that a bubble in the broader stock market may be entering its final stages \u2014 such as excessive leverage \u2014 are absent,\" Higgins wrote. A chart from Capital Economics shows that in prior bubbles, including the 2021 meme stock surge, margin debt rose in line with the S&P 500.

        "content": "US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the wholesale inflation data in the US was 'quite mixed' - Samuel Corum/Bloomberg\n\nUS wholesale prices accelerated last month, according to fresh US government data, rising by more than expected and raising concerns about interest rate cuts.\n\nThe rise provides yet more evidence that the US Federal Reserve\u2019s fight against inflation is far from over, and will likely lead the US central bank to keep interest rates at their 23-year highs for longer than previously thought.\n\nThe producer price index (PPI) jumped by 0.5pc in April, the Labor Department said, marking a sharp increase from a revised 0.1pc slowdown a month earlier.\n\nThis was well above market expectations of a 0.2pc monthly rise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 2.2pc for the 12 months ending in April, its highest level for a year and up from 2.1pc the previous month.\n\nWall Street shrugged off the data to edge higher in early trading, while the dollar was down 0.1pc against the pound at $1.258.\n\nUS Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the figures were \u201cquite mixed\u201d, adding \u201cI don\u2019t think we know\u201d whether inflation will be persistent.\n\nKyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, said: \u201cThe Fed must be pulling their hair out here.

James\u00a0Warrington reports:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe auction house is attempting to sell works of art and other items worth $840m (\u00a3670m) in its spring auctions, which began on Friday.\n\nBut the sales, which account for nearly half of Christie\u2019s annual revenues, have been hampered by an apparent cyber attack.\n\nThe company\u2019s official website has been offline since late Thursday, threatening to derail online bidding.\n\nThe incident forced Christie\u2019s to delay a Geneva auction of a collection of rare watches, including some owned by Mr Schumacher. The sale went ahead on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nChristie\u2019s has since directed customers to a separate website for online bidding, while it has said bids can still be placed over the phone and in person.\n\nIn a statement, the auction house said it had been targeted in a \u201ctechnology security incident\u201d.\n\nIt added: \u201cChristie\u2019s has in place well-established protocols and practices, which are regularly tested, to manage such incidents.\u201d\n\nThe Only Watch charity auction went ahead on Friday without online bidding. It raised 28m Swiss francs (\u00a325m) for muscular dystrophy research.\n\nOther high-profile items going under the hammer include a Vincent van Gogh painting valued at $35m and a selection of fine wines and jewellery.

That was not enough to offset canceled sales covering 33 planes, 29 of which were related to the shutdown of Lynx Air, a Canadian discount airline that stopped flying in late February.\n\nAs expected, deliveries of new Boeing jet airliners were weak, at 24 in April.\n\nThe manufacturer has been in the spotlight since January when a plug door blew out of an Alaska Airlines 737 Max shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon.\n\nPilots were able to land the plane safely, but the incident attracted intense scrutiny from the US Federal Aviation Authority, which is limiting production of new Boeing 737 Max jets while the company tries to improve its manufacturing quality.\n\nLast month, Boeing revealed that its revenues had dropped 8pc in the first quarter of the year.\n\nDave Calhoun, the company\u2019s boss, said:\n\nWe will take the time necessary to strengthen our quality and safety management systems and this work will position us for a stronger and more stable future.

Daniel Woolfson reports:\n\nIt has become a high street staple after opening hundreds of stores in the last decade and is currently pushing into areas where it has been less exposed.\n\nRoisin Currie, the chief executive, said: \u201cThe areas where we\u2019re underrepresented ... that is, places like retail parks, petrol forecourts, supermarkets and also transport locations ... airports, train stations, bus stations.\u201d\n\nGreggs has opened 64 new shops this year. It currently has around 2,500 across the UK.\n\nDespite having thousands of shops, Ms Currie has said she believes Britain is nowhere near \u201cpeak Greggs\u201d and that the company could eventually run more than 3,000 stores across the UK.\n\nIt plans new stores in parts of the country in which it has been less exposed, such as the South.\n\nGreggs has also put together a small team within the business to explore whether it could open stores in other countries.\n\nAs well as opening new stores, the chain has mounted a challenge to the likes of Dominos by ramping up its focus on pizza slices and other dinner options during the cost of living crisis. A significant number of its stores now remain open well into the evening.

Moreover, schools and competitors reported that ESS had objected to the alternative solutions put forward to enable the extraction of their data.\n\nESS said the CMA announcement over its latest probe \u201coverlooks the fact that there are legitimate methods of migrating data ... to the systems provided by our competitors\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for the firm said:\n\nGuidance on these methods has long been available and we have made multiple communications to competitors, customers (and their support providers) explaining this.\n\nThat some competitors have chosen to ignore these methods and have instead created a \u2018workaround\u2019 that accesses our core code, is the only abuse in this situation.\n\nIt simply cannot be correct that the only way to sustain a competitive market is for one organisation to be forced to allow its competitors open access to its core intellectual property, which it has invested large amounts of time and money in developing.\n\n03:44 PM BST\n\nOzempic maker Novo Nordisk borrows to buy factories\n\nWegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk is selling \u20ac4.65bn (\u00a34bn) in bonds as it races to increase its manufacturing capacity for its in-demand drugs.\n\nBloomberg said that the proceeds will help it finance its $11bn \u00a0acquisition of factories from Catalent, citing a Novo spokesperson.\n\n03:33 PM BST\n\nBritish Airways boosted by demand for cargo in wake of Red Sea crisis\n\nAttacks on ships in the Red Sea are prompting companies to send more goods by air, providing a surprise boost to British Airways. Christopher Jasper has the details:\n\nDemand for cargo space on the airline\u2019s services from the Far East has boomed since Houthi militants in Yemen began attacking the vital trade lane last October.\n\nSince British Airways no longer operates dedicated freighter planes, the shipments are carried in the holds of passenger jets, boosting the viability of those flights even as Asian demand for travel struggles to recover to pre-Covid levels.\n\nOther consignments from China, Japan and Korea are also being loaded onto London-bound BA planes in India and Dubai after beginning their journey to Europe by ship.\n\nThe sea-to-air transfers cut out the risk of Houthi missile strikes, while also avoiding the long delays that ships would face by taking the alternative 4,000-mile, 12-day diversion via the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nProducts being transferred from ship to plane tend to be of high value, given the higher cost of airborne deliveries.\n\nIn the past few months, products sent on BA planes have included mobile phones, computer equipment and microprocessing chips, and essential components for automobile production and the aerospace sector.\n\nIAG Cargo has hubs at London Heathrow, Madrid, Dublin and Barcelona and employs more than 2,250 people. The division generated revenue of \u20ac1.15bn (\u00a31bn) last year, up 3.5pc from pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWhile demand has been boosted by importers looking for alternative trade roots, cargo revenue still slumped 12pc in the first three months of the year. It came as global supply chains continued to normalise, putting downward pressure on prices.

        "content": "Robinhood (HOOD) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) jumped 9.9% in the morning session after heavily shorted stocks (so-called meme stocks) continued to rally, with both AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) up more than 60%. On May 13, 2024, famous Wall Street Bets (Reddit stock trading forum) trader Keith Gill (known online as Roaring Kitty) returned to Twitter (also known as X) after three years, fueling a greater retail appetite for meme stocks. These moves could also drive volumes on trading platforms such as Robinhood as more retail investors jump on the bandwagon.\n\nIs now the time to buy Robinhood? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nRobinhood's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 18 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 2 months ago, when the stock gained 13.3% after the company provided its February 2024 operating data reflecting strong asset growth and higher trading volumes. Although its funded customers were only up by 130k compared to the previous month (23.6 million total), its Assets Under Custody (AUC) rose to $118.7 billion, representing a 16% month-on-month increase. This was driven by growing momentum in the public markets, which led to higher stock and cryptocurrency prices, and new inflows from existing customers into Robinhood's retirement products, which are offering customers a 3% match on any contributions. As a result, it wasn't surprising that volumes were up across all asset classes compared to the previous month. Notably, equity trading volumes were $80.9 billion (up 36% m/m) while crypto trading volumes were $6.5 billion (up 10% m/m). Given the increased platform activities, Securities Lending Revenue also benefitted and came in at $13 million, up 8%. Overall, the data showed Robinhood is performing well in the near term.\n\nRobinhood is up 49.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $18.48 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $20.13 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood's shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $530.59.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Meme stocks have the potential to completely change the portfolio health even with a limited exposure of 5% to 10%. The best example now is Carvana (NYSE:CVNA), which surged from under-$5 levels at the beginning of 2023 to $117. At the same time, there are meme stock ideas that have destroyed wealth. These meme stocks to avoid are likely to cater in the coming quarters.\n\nNote that some meme stocks represent companies with average to good fundamentals. Additionally, there are potential business catalysts that can support the rally. On the other hand, there are meme stocks that represent companies with weak fundamentals. When buying meme stocks, it\u2019s important to focus only on ideas that decent businesses back.\n\nThe meme stocks to avoid represent fundamentally weak companies. These stocks have remained weak and are seemingly oversold. Investors should, however, avoid the trap of buying at these levels as the correction is likely to be sustained.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air Touring sedan display at the Service Center. Lucid Motors (LCID) is a manufacturer of luxury EV Electric Vehicles.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe correction has been unabated for Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock. In the last 12 months, LCID stock has plunged by 62%. However, I believe there is further downside due to the meme stock.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Lucid Group currently commands a market valuation of $6.1 billion. For Q1 2024, the company reported revenue of $172.7 million. This would imply an annual revenue of $700 million. For a company that continues to report significant cash burn, a valuation of around 10x revenue seems stretched.\n\nAnother point to note is that for Q1 2024, Lucid reported operating level losses of $730 million. For Q1 2023, operating level losses were $772 million. Therefore, losses have been sustained at higher levels. With macroeconomic headwinds and intense competition, it\u2019s a big challenge to scale-up and narrow losses.\n\nThe only positive for now seems to be a strong cash buffer and the impending launch of Lucid Gravity. I believe this might not be enough to deliver a reversal for LCID stock.\n\nGameStop (GME) In this photo illustration the GameStop (GME) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) set the ball rolling for a historic meme stock rally of 2021. However, as the euphoria fizzled out, the focus was back on fundamentals. It\u2019s, therefore, not surprising that GME stock has been in a sustained downtrend.\n\nAmidst the broad downtrend, GME stock has rallied by almost 40% in the last six months. This is a good opportunity to exit. The stock traded at 52-week lows of $10 and will trade at new lows in the next 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the last financial year, GameStop reported revenue of $5.3 billion. On a year-on-year basis, revenue declined by 10%. Further, operating loss was $34 million for the year. While operating losses narrowed, it\u2019s clear that the business has low margins and does seem like an attractive investment.\n\nAdditionally, cash used in operations for the year was $204 million. Ultimately, the cash flows determine valuations, and I don\u2019t see GameStop delivering healthy cash flows in the coming years.\n\nNovavax (NVAX) Novavax (NVAX) research laboratory logotype enlarged with a magnifying glass.This laboratory has developed a vaccine against the covid-19 virus. NVAX price predictions.\n\nSource: pixinoo / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock skyrocketed by almost 100% in the last trading session. It seems that more gains are likely in the coming weeks, and I expect NVAX stock to trade in the range of $12 to $15. However, once the news-based euphoria is over, NVAX is likely to trend lower. I, therefore, see the rally as a good time for investors who have been trapped for an extended period to exit.\n\nComing to the news, Novavax announced a co-exclusive licensing agreement with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY). Under this agreement, Novavax will receive cash and an equity investment totaling $1.2 billion. In exchange, Sanofi will have a co-exclusive license to co-commercialize Novavax\u2019s current stand-alone adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine. Further, Sanofi will also have sole license to use Novavax\u2019s adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine in combination with Sanofi\u2019s flu vaccines.\n\nWithout a doubt, the development is positive, but there are two concerns. First, the demand for COVID-19 vaccines is on a decline globally. Further, Novavax is still building a pipeline. The cash infusion will be used for clinical trials. There\u2019s unlikely to be a sustained impact on revenue anytime soon. Therefore, the excitement will likely fizzle out and NVAX stock will trend lower.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "GameStop Stock (NYSE:GME): This Game Is Rigged Against You",
        "content": "Well, here we go again. The rigged game of meme-stock trading is back in vogue, evidently. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock traders deserve the credit or, perhaps, the blame for this. I won\u2019t win any popularity contests for this, but I am bearish on GME stock and expect this mania phase to end badly, just like it did after the 2021 hype cycle (see the chart below).\n\nIf anybody cares anymore, GameStop sells physical copies of video games and, to a lesser extent, digital copies of games. Generally speaking, today\u2019s gamers directly download or stream their video games instead of purchasing them through GameStop.\n\nThe problem is that financial traders have notoriously short attention spans \u2013 but you don\u2019t have to fall into that trap. I sincerely hope that this message reaches you before you commit your hard-earned capital to GameStop stock, only to probably end up regretting it later on.\n\nGameStop: The Unusual Reason for the Rally\n\nAs I\u2019ll describe in a few moments, Wall Street\u2019s analysts barely cover GameStop (and the one Wedbush analyst covering GameStop definitely isn\u2019t bullish). That\u2019s because seasoned investors don\u2019t take the company very seriously. However, GameStop stock \u2013 I mean the stock, not the company itself \u2013 garnered a lot of attention in 2021. Fast-forward to May 13, 2024, and the original meme stock of the 2020s is top-of-mind once again.\n\nAs covered by TipRanks contributor Shrilekha Pethe, as well as by Bloomberg and others, GME stock unexpectedly zoomed higher on Monday, even doubling in price at around 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. Thanks to Pethe\u2019s reporting, I quickly learned that there weren\u2019t any company-prompted catalysts on May 13, such as an earnings report or an announcement from GameStop\u2019s CEO, Ryan Cohen.\n\nInstead, the event that got meme-stock traders excited was a posting from \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d or @TheRoaringKitty, on social-media platform X. Previously a prolific Reddit user and meme-stock guru, \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d posted on X on Monday, and this was his first X or Reddit posting since the height of stock-market speculative fervor in 2021.\n\nJudging from his X posting, it looks like \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d didn\u2019t have much to say, as the post was just an image of a video game player sitting in an upright position in a chair. Is he suggesting that he\u2019s now sitting up and paying attention to something after a lengthy absence?\n\nGameStop: It\u2019s All FOMO and YOLO\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, there\u2019s no denying that \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d has some clout in the online trading community. Judging by Monday\u2019s stunning surge in GME stock, it\u2019s clear that meme-stock traders haven\u2019t lost their sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and YOLO (you only live once).\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancial Insyghts President Peter Atwater succinctly summed up the still-considerable influence of \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d and the implications of Monday\u2019s apparent meme-stock revival.\n\n\u201cThat he is able to generate a crowd says that the crowd is back to feeling FOMO and YOLO in an enormous way\u2026 When people dive into things that are of pure speculative value, their confidence is extremely high and this is one of the ways that it manifests,\u201d Atwater explained.\n\nThe key phrase here is \u201cpure speculative value.\u201d With TipRanks\u2019 tools at my disposal, I can immediately discern that GameStop isn\u2019t on rock-solid ground when it comes to the company\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nThe GameStop financials page is particularly useful here. As it turns out, the company has negative free cash flow (FCF) and roughly $600 million in total debt.\n\nFurthermore, on the GameStop earnings page, I discovered that Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast calls for the company to flip from an adjusted profit in Q4 2023 to an adjusted loss in Q1 2024. Only time will tell whether GameStop actually lost money in the first quarter, since the company is expected to release its earnings report on June 5.\n\nYet, eager meme-stock traders have already pumped up the GameStop share price prior to the earnings report. Now, GameStop has the unenviable burden of having to justify its sky-high share price \u2013 just like in 2021, and that story didn\u2019t end well in 2022, 2023, and early 2024.\n\nTo finish this cautionary note, I\u2019ll defer to the wisdom and experience of Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data at Vanda Research. He warned, \u201cThese surges in retail activity have served as contrarian signals, prompting institutional investors to quickly short the stock following these rallies driven by retail investors.\u201d So, would you rather be on the side of the retail crowd or the large-scale whales?\n\nIs GameStop Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, GME comes in as a Moderate Sell based on\u00a0one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. GameStop stock\u2019s price target is $5.60, implying 81.6% downside potential.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider GameStop Stock?\n\nThe strange surge in GameStop stock might be a \u201ccontrarian signal,\u201d to borrow a phrase from Pierantoni. However, I don\u2019t recommend trying to fade today\u2019s move and short-sell the stock. That\u2019s just asking for trouble.\n\nOn the other hand, serious investors should think long and hard about GameStop\u2019s fundamentals. The company has to deal with weak consumer spending and strong competition. Short-term traders might ignore the red flags, but I believe you shouldn\u2019t. All in all, the game is rigged against investors who chase GME stock in hopes of long-term gains, and I\u2019m definitely not considering buying any shares today.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. shares more than doubling on no fundamental news. Short sellers getting squeezed and retail traders using same-day options to amplify gains in otherwise beaten-down stocks. Nonsense crypto coins adding more than 1,000%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind GameStop Shares Soar as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Meme Mania China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Tesla Rehires Some Supercharger Workers Weeks After Musk\u2019s Cuts\n\nThat was Monday. But it could just as easily describe early 2021, when the meme-stock frenzy captured the popular imagination and day traders sent stocks on inexplicable wild rides. However a closer look at the magnitude and zaniness back then shows how much further this latest meme mania needs to go to match the original.\n\nIn the first go-round three years ago, GameStop soared more than 1,000% in a few days, as retail traders took to Reddit Inc.\u2019s Wall Street Bets forum to rally against Wall Street bigwigs who were short the stock. Today, those \u201cReddit Raiders,\u201d once flush with time and cash from pandemic-era stimulus and work policies, are largely back to work and bearing the burden of higher interest rates. Some got in late, and even with the latest surge are sitting on losses.\n\nIn addition, traders with an itch to gamble now have a bevy of choices for wagering. Casinos and racetracks were closed back then due to Covid, leaving stocks as the main game in town. Since then gambling has gone mainstream, and anyone who wants to place a bet can basically get action on any game they want from a few clicks on their phone.\n\nProfessional short sellers have also have largely given up on taking aim at companies with relatively small share floats, worried that the power of social media could foment a squeeze. And volumes in short-dated options, while still elevated, are nowhere near the levels seen in 2021.\n\n\u201cThese are always blips, they\u2019re like solar eclipses \u2014 they happen and then they go away for a long time and then they happen again,\u201d said Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary. \u201cBut if you look at them they always appear at extremes in sentiment.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s buying was triggered by a single post on X Sunday night from Keith Gill, the retail-trading icon who goes by the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d and drove the original mania before disappearing from social media in June 2021. In less than an hour, GameStop added some $6 billion in market value as traders pumped Gill\u2019s return to tweeting as a sign that the boom was back. Former meme darling AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. rallied more than 80%. And newly listed Reddit powered higher by as much as 14%. In cryptocurrencies, the Roaring Kitty token is up more than 4,000%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the moves pared back sharply as the session moved into the afternoon \u2014 GameStop closed up 74% \u2014 tamping down speculation about the start of another meme mania. Here\u2019s a closer look at some financial metrics that explain why:\n\nOptions\n\nOptions volumes have picked up in the past few weeks, but they\u2019re nothing like the levels seen in 2021. About 700,000 contracts changed hands on Monday \u2014 more than four time the average over the past month. Calls led as large numbers of $30 and $34 contracts moved.\n\nHowever, during peak meme mania in 2021, millions of contracts traded in a single session. The most active day that year \u2014 Jan. 22 \u2014 saw 8.5 million contracts change hands.\n\nMixed Orders\n\nA driver of 2021\u2019s craze was that the bulk of retail traders didn\u2019t already own GameStop, let alone at higher prices. In January of that year, GameStop was consistently the most bought stock across trading platforms that cater to individual investors with buy orders vastly outpacing those to sell.\n\nOn Monday, that wasn\u2019t the case. While GameStop was the most traded stock on Fidelity\u2019s platform, orders to sell shares nearly mirrored buys. This indicates that the retail crowd was selling to each other rather than being the sole driver of the stock gains. Even with the pop, GameStop is far from an intraday peak. The stock would need to more than quadruple from Monday\u2019s close to reach that peak.\n\nLess Money to Buy Stocks\n\nWhen Roaring Kitty and now GameStop Chief Executive Ryan Cohen kickstarted the meme craze, interest rates were near historic lows, while equity markets \u2014 and cryptocurrencies \u2014 were soaring as the Federal Reserve and Congress pumped trillions of dollars in stimulus aid to prop up an American economy gripped by recession in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThe previous GameStop saga took center stage three years ago, before the Fed began lifting rates in March 2022 at the fastest pace in a generation to cool inflation. Now, the stock market \u2014 and the economy \u2014 are in a different place, and retail traders have seen a reversal of fortunes as high borrowing costs diminish their holdings in risky assets.\n\nThat\u2019s on top of the fact that credit-card delinquencies at the smallest banks are running at the highest rate in 30 years, and those at large banks are at decade highs. That means liquidity for small-time investors is likely at a low, and the end of stay-at-home orders indicates the YOLO crowd is back at work or school and not glued to a trading app.\n\nMemecoin Mania\n\nThe vast nature of cryptocurrencies with no inherent value has also sopped up a chunk of retail investor cash. The meme craze surrounding Gill\u2019s return has spilled into the world of crypto, as a token created at the end of January utilizing GameStop\u2019s name, logo and ticker rose more than 1,400% on Monday before paring some of that surge, according to CoinGecko data, despite having no affiliation with the company.\n\nThe so-called memecoins are prone to wild swings based on the popularity of the tokens across social media platforms. The coins, which often trade for fractions of a penny, can see surges in volume and price based on a few traders pumping in small amounts of cash.\n\nScars From 2021\n\nThe 2021 meme-stock frenzy that upended the US stock market and schooled some Wall Street pros didn\u2019t end well after the bear market of 2022. The YOLO crowd lost all of the money made in the meme-stock rush, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. showed in 2022.\n\nSo, while the group\u2019s activity on Monday is rekindling memories of a 2021 rush, it\u2019s not there yet. Trading orders from retail traders in stocks and exchange-traded funds accounted for 24% of the market\u2019s total volume in the first quarter of 2021, estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show. That compares with a little more than 17% in the first quarter of 2024, BI\u2019s data show.\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna and Jessica Menton.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nKids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Corporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

This followed a University of Michigan report on Friday that showed U.S. consumer sentiment sagged to a six-month low in May as households worried about the cost of living.\n\nLast week the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 both registered their third straight weeks of gains, boosted by strong earnings reports and signs of a cooling labor market that fueled bets of one or two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.\n\nBut on Monday investors appeared anxious to stay clear of making big bets ahead of April Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due out on Wednesday. They will also preparing to monitor producer price index data, retail sales data, weekly jobless claims and earnings reports from big retailers Home Depot and Walmart, all due out this week.\n\n\"Investors are like somebody looking out the window trying to see what the weather's like before deciding what to wear. Today and tomorrow are going to be all about Wednesday's consumer inflation report,\" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group in Dallas.\n\n\"In the last three months that's been the single biggest mover. Each of these times inflation's come in a little bit stickier than investors had expected. Each time that's happened investors have ratcheted back expectations for interest rate cuts.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 81.33 points, or 0.21%, to 39,431.51, the S&P 500 lost 1.26 points, or 0.02%, to 5,221.42 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 47.37 points, or 0.29%, to 16,388.24.\n\nAnthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, said the \"marked deterioration in consumer sentiment and rising expectations around inflation\" from the consumer sentiment surveys puts even more weight on the upcoming inflation data.\n\n\"Stocks are just kind of stuck in this really tight trading range until we get some more information on inflation trends,\" said Saglimbene.\n\nStory continues\n\nCore consumer prices are expected to have risen 0.3% on a month-over-month basis in April and 3.6% on an annual basis according to economist forecasts in a Reuters poll ahead of Wednesday's release.\n\nFed Vice Chair Phillip Jefferson said earlier on Monday that he supports keeping interest rates steady until it is clear that price pressures are moderating.\n\nAmong the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors only two gained ground on Monday.\n\nTechnology provided the biggest boost and\n\nApple was its biggest index point contributor.\n\nInvestors in the sector were focused on artificial intelligence technology with Apple shares closing up 1.8% after a report that it had closed in on an agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to use the startup's technology on the iPhone.\n\nOpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, said it would release a new AI model capable of realistic voice conversation and able to interact across text and image.\n\nAlphabet, expected to show off its own new AI-related features at its developers' conference on Tuesday, managed to close up 0.3% after falling as much as 2.7% during the session.\n\nShares of videogame retailer GameStop jumped soared 74% after \"Roaring Kitty\", a former marketer at an insurance firm credited with sparking the 2021 meme stock rally, returned to X.com after a three-year hiatus.\n\nOther highly shorted names involved in the 2021 meme rally also rose. AMC Entertainment jumped 78% and Koss Corp closed up 36.7%.\n\nOn U.S. exchanges 10.09 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.79 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 311 new highs and 40 new lows.\n\nOn the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.14-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 145 new highs and 91 new lows.

        "content": "GameStop stock (GME) soared as much as 110% Monday before paring gains, and it was halted for volatility numerous times after \"Roaring Kitty,\" the person who is seen as the kick-starter of the meme stock frenzy during the pandemic, posted online for the first time since 2021.\n\nThe stock crossed above $30 per share on Monday to close up 75%. Shares had been on an upward trend, rising about 60% over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Roaring Kitty,\" who was identified that year as Keith Gill, became a prominent figure on the WallStreetBets subreddit and YouTube for his bullish stance on GameStop (GME).\n\nSunday's post on X, formerly known as Twitter, included a meme of a video gamer leaning forward, appearing to take the game seriously. The post received more than 81,000 likes and 9,000 comments. The last time Roaring Kitty posted on X was in June 2021.\n\nHe was known for posting commentary about why GameStop would go higher and eventually testified before Congress about the massive January 2021 short squeeze spurred by an army of retail traders.\n\npic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024\n\nShort interest on GameStop sits at around 24% of the float, according to S3 Partners data.\n\n\"Including today's losses, GME shorts are now down -$1.34 billion in May month-to-date losses, and now down -$952 million for the year,\" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.\n\nMonday's short squeeze follows a recent rally in meme-related stocks. Theater chain operator AMC (AMC) gained as much as 50% during the session, while Trump Media & Technology (DJT) gained 8%.\n\n\"Short sellers may be in for a bumpy and bloody ride in these stocks,\" said Dusaniwsky.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jared Blikre recently noted, the recent meme stock surge doesn't appear to be the ominous signal it has been in the past, but rather a healthy risk appetite for investments.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US stocks and bonds are facing an upside risk this week as traders keep building long positions across asset classes heading into key inflation data, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy GameStop Shares Soar as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Meme Mania Global Chips Battle Intensifies With $81 Billion Subsidy Surge\n\n\u201cI am starting to see some real FOMO start to develop based on incomings last week,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Global Markets Division managing director and tactical specialist Scott Rubner wrote in a note to clients Monday.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index hovered near 5,220 Monday after three straight weeks of gains, fueled by prospects that the Federal Reserve will eventually cut interest rates this year and resilient corporate earnings. So far 79% of S&P companies beat earnings-per-share forecasts for the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeme stocks were also revitalized with unprofitable and heavily shorted names rallying Monday as GameStop Corp. soared after Keith Gil, who drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 under the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d posted on X \u2014 generating speculation that he might be returning to social media.\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty is back, the message boards are going crazy this morning,\u201d said Rubner. \u201cIt is time for a thread.\u201d\n\nWild swings in GameStop shares were fueled by call options that traders quietly gathered earlier in May.\n\nCommodity trading advisers, funds that use systematic strategies to trade futures contracts, have already been increasing long equity positions in US stocks, according to Rubner. Total systematic equity, which includes CTAs, vol control, and risk-parity funds, show an overshot exposure, after decreasing long positions into an earlier selloff in April, he wrote.\n\nRubner says CTA equity and fixed-income demand is notable in the next week with a so-called \u201cgreen sweep\u201d showing up in most of Goldman\u2019s models. This means investors will keep piling into US stocks and bonds even if the market goes down.\n\n\u201cI think there is upside risk to the US 60/40 portfolio this week,\u201d Rubner said.\n\nWithout specifying the magnitude of a potential upward or downward move in the S&P 500, he noted that inflows into US stocks can be between $7.6 billion to $13.2 billion over the next week.\n\nOn top of that, as more than 90% of S&P 500 companies have reported first quarter earnings, the market is in the \u201cpeak open window\u201d for corporate buybacks with about $5.5 billion worth of daily demand until mid-June, said Rubner.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more: With Fed on Hold, Corporate Buybacks Offer Stocks a Tailwind\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "Why Are GameStop (GME) Shares Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) jumped 119% in the morning session after meme stocks soared (AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) +14%, Newegg Commerce (NASDAQ:NEGG) +14%, Beyond (NYSE:BYON) +14%). Gamestop's stock rally also coincided with the return of the famous Wall Street Bets (Reddit stock trading forum) trader Keith Gill (known online as Roaring Kitty) to Twitter (also known as X.com) after three years. The moves likely point to the growing interest of retail investors in the stock market.\n\nIs now the time to buy GameStop? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nGameStop's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 38 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for GameStop and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 2 months ago, when the stock\u00a0 dropped 19.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue unfortunately falling short of analysts' expectations, driven by significant underperformance in its software segment ($465m of revenue vs. estimates of $670m). Because the company's software products have higher profit margins than its hardware products, it missed Wall Street's estimates on nearly every profitability metric. The company also didn't provide any guidance and said it would not host a conference call to discuss the results, which raises an eyebrow. Overall, this was a bad quarter for GameStop.\n\nGameStop is up 82.7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of GameStop's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $14,746.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

The long-term average is 66.7%.\n\nAt 11:24 a.m. the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.17 points, or 0.12%, to 39,560.01, the S&P 500 gained 2.90 points, or 0.06%, to 5,225.58 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 42.66 points, or 0.26%, to 16,383.53.\n\nShares of videogame retailer GameStop jumped 65% after \"Roaring Kitty\", a former marketer at an insurance firm credited with sparking the 2021 meme stock rally, returned to X.com after a three-year hiatus.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther highly shorted names including AMC jumped 32% and Koss Corp soared 25%.\n\nAlphabet slipped 1.5% as Microsoft-backed OpenAI looked set to announce its artificial intelligence (AI)-powered search product on Monday.\n\nApple added 1.6% after a report said the company had closed in on an agreement with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to use the startup's technology on the iPhone.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.26-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and 1.99-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 125 new highs and 61 new lows.

        "content": "Meme Mania: COVID-19 was the Perfect Storm\n\nThe 2020 U.S. equity crash and subsequent rebound was the perfect storm for a unique event called the \u201cMeme\u201d stock craze. After the panic lows of March 2020, stocks bottomed, and the government started to pump liquidity into the market and everyday Americans with stimulus checks. With many people working remotely, confined to their homes, and with more money in their pockets, Americans started trading in the stock market.\n\nBy 2021, a message board called \u201cWallstreetbets\u201d gained a cult-like following on the social media website Reddit. At the center of the Wallstreetbets subcategory was a GameStop (GME) investor named Keith Gill, better known by his handle \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d Gill made the astute observation that big institutional investors were heavily short GME shares and decided to band together a hoard of retail investors to orchestrate a classic short squeeze. The plan worked. In January 2021, GME shares gained over 1600% in a single month!\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d is Back\n\nMonday morning, Roaring Kitty tweeted an image of a person sitting forward in a chair \u2013 a meme that signifies \u201cthings are getting serious.\u201d GME shares gained more than 100% based on the tweet. So much for the efficient market hypothesis! Meanwhile, other former meme stock favorites such as AMC (AMC),Beyond (BYON), and Upstart Holdings (UPST) spiked in sympathy.\n\nMeme Craze Lessons\n\nTrading meme stocks is not for everyone. Below are 3 essential lessons to consider:\n\n\u201cMarkets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\u201d: Though the fundamental reason for such moves is obviously questionable, it doesn\u2019t mean these stocks can\u2019t move higher.\n\nWhen music stops, it can get ugly: As fast as stocks move higher, they can also move lower. GME plunged nearly 70% in February 2021.\n\nExpect Hyper Volatility: With so many investors watching the same stocks, higher volatility is a given.\n\n3 Meme Stocks Worth Considering\n\nThough GME is the king of meme stocks, it is also likely to be the most volatile. Instead of chasing meme stocks with no fundamentals or catalysts, I prefer to do the opposite. Below are 3 meme stocks to consider:\n\nNovavax (NVAX)\n\nLast week, NVAX shares doubled on volume 2,000x the norm after the company announced a deal with biotechgiant Sanofi (SNY) toco-commercialize a COVID-19 vaccine and develop novel COVID-19-Influenza combination vaccines. The deal is a game changer for the company for 3 reasons.\n\n1. Cash Injection: NVAX will get cash and equity worth ~$1.2 billion. (NVAX market cap is just $1.69 billion)\n\nStory continues\n\n2. SNY Stake: Sanofi will take a minority equity investment in the stock. Perhaps the company will buy more NVAX in the future.\n\n3. Distribution: A deal with a biotech juggernaut like SNY provides NVAX with distribution.\n\nReddit (RDDT)\n\nSocial media giant RDDT recently went public. RDDT stands to benefit from increased traffic from meme stock mania indirectly. More importantly, RDDT is likely to benefit immensely from the AI revolution. Because of RDDT\u2019s immense popularity, the website is perfect for \u201ctraining\u201d large language models such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. RDDT recently scored a $60 million annual licensing deal with Alphabet (GOOGL) to train its large language models. As the race for AI supremacy heats up, RDDT will likely cash in on more licensing deals.RDDT is currently forming a classic and bullish IPO \u201cU-turn\u201d base structure. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTSLA is one of the original meme stocks, which went from $23 to over $400 during the first meme stock craze. The stock has the perfect recipe for a run. It continues to be heavily shorted, has several catalysts ahead (like the Cybertruck rollout), and has a bargain base valuation.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMonday\u2019s market action tells us that meme stocks are back in play. However, because not all meme stocks are created equally, investors should focus on those with fundamental catalysts.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The activity aligns with GameStop\u2019s soaring stock price, which jumped 68% in the three weeks through last Friday as trading volume took off.\n\nThe heavy volume over the past several weeks came despite a dearth of corporate catalysts or news that could drive a rally in the shares. It also predated the oblique Sunday night tweet from the account associated with Keith Gill, who drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 under the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d stoking speculation that Gill, whose X account has been inactive for almost three years, might return to social media. He tweeted again on Monday morning, although neither post specifically mentioned GameStop.\n\nRead more: GameStop Surges as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Return Adds Fuel to Rally\n\nOn Friday, $20 and $30 calls dominated Gamestop trading.

Within hours of Monday\u2019s stock market opening, both contracts became profitable as the shares climbed as high as $38.20.\n\nThroughout May, mentions of Gamestop on online forums like Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets and StockTwits accompanied jumps in its volume and options activity.

        "content": "Shares of GameStop (GME) soared on Monday after the person behind the 2021 rally in the video game retailer's stock resurfaced on social media site X, formally known as Twitter, after a seemingly three-year hiatus. \r\n\r\nThe share price was up 63% intraday, previously hitting its highest level since August 2022 in morning trade.\r\n\r\nThe person, known as \"Roaring Kitty\" on YouTube, posted on X a sketch of a video gamer leaning forward in a chair, a meme used to indicate that things are getting serious. It is the first post on his X timeline since June 2021.\n\nHis legal name is Keith Gill, and is known as \"DeepF\u2014Value\" on Reddit. His posts on Reddit's Wallstreetbets discussion group in 2021 helped drive interest in GameStop. \r\n\r\nA key position of Gill at the time was that GameStop was undervalued and that investors could rally behind the stock and squeeze Wall Street short sellers. Shares of AMC (AMC), another meme stock, rallied 31% in Monday trade.\r\n\r\nGill has not posted on YouTube since April 2021. In the aftermath of the meme rally, Gill was hit with class-action lawsuits, according to media reports. He testified before Congress' House Committee on Financial Services in February 2021 about his role in the frenzied GameStop trading. Others including Robinhood Markets (HOOD) Chief Executive Vlad Tenev also testified at the time.\r\n\r\nIn March 2024, GameStop reported a year-over-year decline in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that reflected softer sales across all three of its operating segments. On a conference call at the time, then-Chief Executive Matthew Furlong said that \"although there is a lot of hard work and necessary execution in front of us, GameStop is a much healthier business today than it was at the start of 2021,\" according to a Capital IQ transcript.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- GameStop Corp. shares surged as speculation swirled around a return to social media by Keith Gill, who drove the meme-stock mania of 2021 under the moniker \u201cRoaring Kitty.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy GameStop Shares Soar as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Revitalizes Meme Mania Putin Names Economist as Defense Minister in Surprise Reshuffle\n\nThe account\u2019s post on X showed a man leaning forward with what looked like a gaming controller, which some traders interpreted to mean that Gill is coming back into action. Gill, whose account has long been dormant, shot to fame in 2021 by rallying day traders on Reddit in an effort to squeeze GameStop short sellers.\n\nThe post had attracted more than 12 million views in the hours since its publication, Gill posted on X again at 11 a.m. New York time, this time a short video clip stating \u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to Gill\u2019s initial post shows shades of the original 2021 mania, with chatter across Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets and activity on StockTwits sparking a rush of retail trader buying.\n\n\u201cThat he is able to generate a crowd says that the crowd is back to feeling FOMO and YOLO in an enormous way,\u201d said Peter Atwater, president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary and the University of Delaware. \u201cWhen people dive into things that are of pure speculative value, their confidence is extremely high and this is one of the ways that it manifests.\u201d\n\nMore than 46 million shares changed hands before 10:15 a.m. in New York, roughly 21-times what\u2019s been normal in that stretch over the past month, as trading was halted for volatility nine times within the opening 90 minutes of trading. Shares rose as much as 119% Monday.\n\nGameStop ripped off a three-week rally in the lead up to Monday\u2019s pop, its longest such winning streak this year as shares soared 68% over that stretch as of Friday\u2019s close.\n\nThe stock famously soared more than 2,000% in early 2021, bringing the meme-stock frenzy into the broader public consciousness. When adjusting for a stock split, the shares peaked at $86.88 near the end of that month before crashing about 88% in three weeks.\n\nRoaring Kitty helped draw attention to the stock\u2019s eye-popping short-interest ratio \u2014 some 140% of available shares were sold short \u2014 as investors bet on the entrepreneur-turned-retail trading icon Ryan Cohen. Cohen, the video-game retailer\u2019s largest shareholder who has a cult-like following among individual investors, built out a stake through early 2021 and pushed to essentially take over the company as retail traders cheered him on.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter selling Chewy Inc., the pet retailer he co-founded, for more than $3 billion in 2017, he plowed much of that into Apple Inc. stock, which went on to rally. His firm, RC Ventures LLC, first disclosed its GameStop stake in 2020 when the shares traded below $2 on a split-adjusted basis (the retailer executed a four-for-one stock split in 2022).\n\nThe billionaire has since built his position to some 36.8 million shares, accounting for 12% of the company, as he became chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board. Late last year, the company disclosed an unorthodox plan for its roughly $900 million in cash and equivalents: allowing Cohen to buy stocks of other companies.\n\nWhile Gill and Cohen have been cast as icons among the hoards of retail traders who praise the duo, many who were late to the initial mania were left holding an almost empty bag. Shares have lost nearly three-quarters of their value from a January 2021 peak when so-called Reddit Raiders flocked to the stock. It\u2019d take another 3,700% boom from Monday\u2019s levels to recoup all of their losses.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the percentage of shares available for trading sold short has stayed at roughly 24%, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. That\u2019s elevated for a typical company but nowhere near the levels that preceded the 2021 mania.\n\nWith no clear catalyst driving the recent gains, GameStop\u2019s move has again seen retail investors make up the bulk of demand. Inflows through the last week totaled $12 million, according to Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data at Vanda Research.\n\n\u201cThese surges in retail activity have served as contrarian signals, prompting institutional investors to quickly short the stock following these rallies driven by retail investors,\u201d Pierantoni added.\n\nGameStop is expected to report quarterly results next month before an annual shareholder meeting. While the majority of Wall Street has avoided covering the stock in recent years, just three analysts cover it with two advising clients to sell and only one assigning a hold rating as none suggest buying the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnalysts have long warned that GameStop was detached from fundamental values as it carries a $9.3 billion market capitalization. The company reported just $6.7 million in net income for 2023, meaning it trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of more than 1,000. For reference, that\u2019s more than double market darling Nvidia Corp.\u2019s multiple of roughly 74.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they have the numbers to keep this up, nor do I think the shorts have the resolve shown by Gabe Plotkin three years ago, so likely this fizzles as the fundamentals continue to deteriorate,\u201d said Wedbush\u2019s Michael Pachter, one of GameStop\u2019s most vocal skeptics.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the lack of a clear strategy has befuddled the few analysts that cover the company. It also hasn\u2019t taken questions on an earnings call since Cohen started to shake-up the company.\n\n\u201cGame sales are flattish, hardware sales are down, and the shift to digital downloads continues, so it\u2019s highly unlikely GameStop can stop shrinking,\u201d said Pachter.\n\nOption activity on GameStop has soared so far this month. Open interest on calls has reached 588,205 contracts, the highest point this year, while 293,402 calls were traded on Friday, nearly three times the 20-day average.\n\nMeanwhile, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. \u2014 another stock favored by retail traders \u2014 jumped as much as 39%. The stock is down more than 99% since its 2021 peak, while GameStop shares have lost more than 60% of their value since then.\n\nThe flurry of activity broadened from former darlings to newer companies that have taken the meme stock baton like BlackBerry Ltd. and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.\n\nThe most-hated stocks tracked by a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has jumped 8.7% in the best day since November 2022. A separate gauge of money-losing technology companies tracked by Goldman Sachs jumped 4.5% on Monday, outperforming the Nasdaq 100 Index by the most since December.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the dynamic duo of meme stock-ery,\u201d said Atwater, who previously ran JPMorgan\u2019s asset-backed securities business and served in executive roles at First USA, Bank One and Juniper Financial.\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika and Elena Popina.\n\n(Updates to add stock halt, volume and analyst comments throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "GameStop's Rally Resumes In May - What Sparked The Interest?\n\nGameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) stock soared in premarket trading on Monday amid possible retail investor interest following a social media post by Roaring Kitty.\n\nShares of struggling video game retailer GameStop surged around 60% in May from $10.91 on May 1 to $17.46 today but remain far from the peak of around $81.2 in 2021.\n\n\u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d a.k.a\u00a0Keith Gill, a social\u00a0media persona whose online posts reportedly sparked a trading frenzy in the so-called \u2018meme stock\u2019 in early 2021, returned on X.com (formerly Twitter) after three years.\n\nGameStop stock also gained on Friday on heavy volume as traders circulated a screenshot of The Roaring Kitty\u2019s X account showing the account liked a post from February,\u00a0referencing the\u00a0film,\u00a0\u201cRun, Lola, Run.\n\nOn Sunday, Gill\u00a0shared a drawing depicting a man leaning forward in a chair, a widely recognized meme among gamers signaling heightened intensity or seriousness.\n\nIt is his first post on X after being notably absent on social media platforms since mid-2021.\n\nIn March,\u00a0GameStop reported first-quarter earnings that came\u00a0below the consensus, sending the shares trade lower.\n\nGill\u2019s Reddit posts in the\u00a0Wallstreetbets group, boasting about his profits from investing in GameStop, ignited the meme stock frenzy of 2021.\n\nThe rally had spread to highly shorted stocks, including\u00a0AMC Entertainment Holdings\u00a0Inc (NYSE:AMC), as Reddit users banded together to squeeze hedge funds\u00a0who\u00a0had bet against GameStop and other firms.\n\nRoaring Kitty sparked a frenzy among day traders, who rallied to invest heavily in GameStop stocks and call options from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThis collective action caused a short squeeze, resulting in GameStop shares skyrocketing by 1,700%.\n\nThis movement targeted hedge fund\u00a0Melvin Capital, which was betting against GameStop and suffered significant losses.\n\nCitadel and Point72 injected nearly $3 billion to stabilize Melvin\u2019s finances.\n\nThe craze led to trading restrictions on platforms like\u00a0Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) due to clearinghouse margin issues, prompting a class-action lawsuit dismissed in August 2023.\n\nGill faced another lawsuit, accusing him of misrepresenting himself as a novice trader despite being a licensed professional.\n\nThe events of 2021 were later adapted into the movie\u00a0\u201cDumb Money,\u201d\u00a0with\u00a0Paul Dano portraying Gill.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as meme investing, shook Wall Street, and the Reddit group WallStreetBets introduced a novel approach to investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead Next: Reddit, Social Media Giant Behind GameStop Saga, Plans $10B March IPO.\n\nPrice Action: GME shares are up 45.10% at $25.34 during the premarket session at last check Monday.\n\nPhoto Courtesy 1take1shot On Shutterstock.com\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nGAMESTOP (GME): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article GameStop's Rally Resumes In May - What Sparked The Interest? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Trader euphoria stemming from the long-awaited return to social media by Keith Gill, the investor known for spearheading 2021\u2019s memestock rally under the name of \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d has spilled over into the world of crypto.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Vows \u2018Day One\u2019 Executive Order Targeting Offshore Wind China to Start $138 Billion Bond Sale on Friday to Boost Economy Putin Names Economist as Defense Minister in Surprise Reshuffle Global Chips Battle Intensifies With $81 Billion Subsidy Surge\n\nA cryptocurrency created at the end of January utilizing GameStop\u2019s name, logo and ticker rose more than 1,400% on Monday, according to CoinGecko data, despite having no legitimate affiliation with the company. GameStop, a video game retailer that became one of the most recognizable memestocks, was a target of Gill\u2019s when he rallied day traders on Reddit in an effort to squeeze the company\u2019s short sellers more than two years ago.\n\nGill\u2019s account posted an image on X on Monday, showing a man leaning forward in his seat while holding a video game controller. Speculators on social media took the post to mean Gill could soon make a return to day trading, with his account having been silent on X since June 2021.\n\nRead More: GameStop Surges as \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 Return Adds Fuel to Rally (2)\n\nMuch like their stock counterparts, a memecoin\u2019s success is determined by its popularity on social media. Trading them, however, couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 easy to set up in a matter of minutes, the tokens are able to generate eye-popping hourly gains due to their tiny size and limited market liquidity. The GME coin, for example, is worth just $0.008212.\n\nDemand for memecoins has skyrocketed since late February as traders sought new ways to earn money, flush with cash from the meteoric rise in prices of larger tokens like Bitcoin and Ether. Coins like Dogwifhat\u2019s WIF, Pepe and Bonk are among the most notable risers.\n\nRead More: Memecoin Billionaires Return With Bets on Being \u2018First Idiot In\u2019\n\nAnother token named Roaring Kitty, created in December, rallied more than 700% on Monday, per CoinGecko. GameStop shares more than doubled on Gill\u2019s post.\n\nA similar trajectory where traders turned from stocks to crypto occurred in 2021 during the first memestock mania. Dogecoin rose as much as 15,444% to a peak of 73 cents in May 2021, up from $0.0047 at the start of that year after Tesla boss Elon Musk repeatedly touted it on social media.\n\n(Updates to add context and pricing from the fourth paragraph onward.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCorporate America Never Really Quit Forced Labor \u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA How Uniqlo\u2019s \u2018Millennial Birkin\u2019 Is Beating Designer Bags Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits Tim Cook Can\u2019t Run Apple Forever.

        "content": "GameStop stock (GME) soared as much as 110% Monday before paring gains and was halted for volatility numerous times after \"Roaring Kitty,\" the person who is seen as the kickstarter of the meme stock frenzy during the pandemic, posted online for the first time since 2021.\n\nThe stock crossed above $30 per share Monday. Shares had been on an upward trend, rising about 60% over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Roaring Kitty,\" who was identified that year as Keith Gill, became a prominent figure on the WallStreetBets subreddit and YouTube for his bullish stance on GameStop (GME).\n\nSunday's post on X, formerly known as Twitter, included a meme of a video gamer leaning forward, appearing to take the game seriously. The post received more than 81,000 likes and 9,000 comments. The last time Roaring Kitty posted on X was in June 2021.\n\nHe was known for posting commentary about why GameStop would go higher and eventually testified before Congress about the massive January 2021 short squeeze spurred by an army of retail traders.\n\npic.twitter.com/YgjVqtgcNS\n\n\u2014 Roaring Kitty (@TheRoaringKitty) May 13, 2024\n\nShort interest on GameStop sits at around 24% of the float, according to S3 Partners data.\n\n\"Including today's losses, GME shorts are now down -$1.34 billion in May month-to-date losses, and now down -$952 million for the year,\" Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, told Yahoo Finance on Monday.\n\nMonday's short squeeze follow a recent rally in meme-related stocks. Theater chain operator AMC (AMC) gained as much as 50% during the session, while Trump Media & Technology (DJT) gained 8%.\n\n\"Short sellers may be in for a bumpy and bloody ride in these stocks,\" said Dusaniwsky.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jared Blikre recently noted, the recent meme stock surge doesn't appear to be the ominous signal it has been in the past, but rather a healthy risk appetite for investments.

In this type of market, it\u2019s equally important to identify not only the best stocks to buy, but F-rated stock picks to avoid a summer slump.\n\nThe benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average is up only 3% in 2024, while the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are both doing better with 8% gains. So, there are plenty of stocks to choose from that would be solid picks for your portfolio.\n\nHowever, weakness in electric vehicles and some consumer sectors continue to plague the market. Meme stocks are wildly unpredictable but often lead to more pain than gain.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Portfolio Grader rates all stocks in the market on an \u201cA\u201d through \u201cF\u201d scale to help determine the best stocks to buy and the key stock picks to avoid.\n\nBy evaluating stocks based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment, the Portfolio Grader allows you to quickly identify which stocks could create the most pain for your portfolio.\n\nThese names are all F-rated stock picks to avoid this month.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is a struggling electric vehicle manufacturer that was once seen to be a potential rival for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). But it hasn\u2019t worked out that way.\n\nTesla is among the EV companies that are in a slump right now, as Tesla slashed the prices of its vehicles to make them more appealing to customers, but at the same time greatly reduced its profit margin and slowed profit growth.\n\nAnd Lucid hasn\u2019t been able to scale its business to be anything more than an afterthought in the EV world, delivering only 6,001 vehicles in all of 2023. Its velocity increased only slightly in the first quarter, when the company manufactured 1,728 vehicles and delivered 1,967.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was $172.7 million, up from $149.4 million a year ago. But the company also lost $729 million in the quarter, which was similar to its $772 million loss in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company is making an effort \u2014 it secured an agreement with the Ayar Third Investment Company, which is an affiliate of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is buying $1 billion in Lucid Group preferred shares.\n\nIt also has a new partnership with the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, which is a Saudi Arabian-based government organization that will work with Lucid on projects.\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to move the needle \u2014 especially as Lucid continues to post massive quarterly losses.

Often meme stocks can be subject to short squeezes if a group of retail investors believe that hedge funds are trying to short a stock.\n\nBut the problem with many meme stocks is that the fundamentals and performance of the company doesn\u2019t match the valuation, and that\u2019s where AMC comes in.\n\nAMC has its supporters, despite a tough 2023 that saw a writers\u2019 strike in Hollywood that stopped production, as well as the continued rise in streaming services that make watching movies at home more appealing.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $951.4 million, down slightly from $954.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company also reported a net loss of $163.5 million and 62 cents per share, which was an improvement from a loss of $235.5 million and $1.71 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nAt best, AMC is a stagnant business. The stock is down 47% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is a play on clean energy. The company makes a battery that uses hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. The only byproduct is water vapor.\n\nWhile Plug Power\u2019s battery is theoretically appealing for businesses and communities that want to lower their carbon footprints, the reality for investors is that Plug Power hasn\u2019t been able to make the business profitable.\n\nThose losses continued in the first quarter of 2024, in which Plug Power reported revenue of $68.2 million, down from $182 million a year ago. Losses grew to $159 million from $69.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nPLUG stock continues to lose ground. The stock is down 47% this year and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) logo in front of stock market price graph\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe second and most infamous of the meme stocks on this list is GameStop (NYSE:GME).\n\nHedge funds famously shorted the retailer in 2021, but retail investors rescued the company with a memorable short squeeze.\n\nThe whole episode was the subject of a film, Dumb Money, in 2023. While the short squeeze is long over, GameStop carries on, giving back all the gains that it earned during those heady but illogical times.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter were $1.794 billion, down from $2.226 billion in the same quarter of 2022. Net income was up slightly, from $48.2 million to $63.1 million.\n\nGameStop stock is wildly unpredictable. Retail investors pushed the stock price up 50% last month for unspecified reasons, but the company is already starting to give back the gains. GME stock is still down 9% for the year and was down 42% before its most recent rally.\n\nI expect it to return to its moribund ways. GME stock gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChegg (CHGG) Chegg (CHGG) logo on the company's web page magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nChegg (NYSE:CHGG) is a California company that offers help to students, including homework assistance, textbook rentals (both physical copies and digitally) and online tutoring.\n\nBut Chegg is facing some critical problems right now due to the rise of artificial intelligence, which is progressing to the point that free generative AI platforms are able to help students \u2014 and even do the work for them \u2014 for free.\n\n\u201cWe question if Chegg can build an AI experience that is meaningfully better than free alternatives that students will be willing to pay for [\u2026] Chegg has historically always beaten free competitors in the marketplace, but we believe the AI wave presents a truly credible free product experience to Chegg\u2019s paid subscription,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a research note.\n\nChegg is also making some changes at the top of its org chart, with Nathan Schultz taking over as CEO to succeed Dan Rosenweig, who is now executive chairman of the board of directors.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $174.4 million, down 7% from a year ago. Subscription services fell 9% to $154.1 million.\n\nCHGG stock is down 56% this year, including 31% in the last month. It gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are a lot of people who can\u2019t get through the day without a cup of coffee \u2014 or a whole pot. And Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) changed the industry when the Seattle-based coffeehouse swept across the country in the 1990s.\n\nBut after Starbucks posted a revenue and EPS miss in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, is it fair to wonder if people are getting tired of high-priced coffee drinks?\n\nComparable store sales fell by 3% in the U.S. and North America, and by 6% in international locations in the quarter. Overall, Starbucks reported revenue of $8.53 billion, down nearly 2% from a year ago.\n\nA major challenge for Starbucks is its ambitions in China. Luckin Coffee (OTCMTKS:LKNCY) passed Starbucks as the top coffeehouse in China last year and maintains an aggressive pricing plan that undercuts Starbucks.\n\nNot surprisingly, Starbucks stock is down 23% this year with most of those losses coming after the company\u2019s Q2 earnings report. Starbucks has its work cut out for it, and there\u2019s no need for investors to hold on while hoping for a turnaround.\n\nSBUX stock gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt may be fair to say that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is a victim of its own success. The company was wildly successful in the last few years as it was one of the first to create and market a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThat success brought in billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nBut because people aren\u2019t getting vaccinated against Covid-19 as often as they were a year or two ago, Pfizer is facing some extremely challenging comparable numbers as it reports earnings.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $14.8 billion, down from $18.4 billion a year ago. Pfizer reported income of $4.6 billion and 82 cents per share, but that wasn\u2019t as good as a year ago when it reported $7 billion in income and $1.23 per share.\n\nPfizer issued full-year guidance for revenue between $58.5 billion and $61.5 billion, and adjusted EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. Pfizer says that it expects to get $8 billion in combined revenue this year from its Covid-19 vaccinations, with the majority of that coming in the second half of the year.\n\nPFE stock is one to watch for a turnaround, but we aren\u2019t there yet. The stock is down 2% in 2024 and gets an \u201cF\u201d rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis\u00a0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Despite the inflation concerns and the market ups and downs, 2024 will be a much better year for investors compared to 2023. The current market situation may not seem like it,\u00a0but\u00a0we\u2019ve seen better days in the past few months. The earnings season is boosting the stock market,\u00a0and\u00a0the outlook could improve as we progress through the year.\u00a0This\u00a0is an ideal time to move away from the hot and attractive stocks and look at the undervalued sleeper stocks with high upside potential.\n\nAn early-mover advantage can reap significant benefits for you. Here are three undervalued sleeper stocks that can be solid bets this month. With at least one rate cut anticipated in the year, the financial environment will improve,\u00a0and\u00a0these stocks could benefit. They are cheap and have a substantial upside. Let\u2019s take a look at three undervalued sleeper stocks.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLegacy automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM)\u00a0isn\u2019t new to the business,\u00a0and\u00a0the company has seen several market ups and downs. It survived inflation and is bouncing back with\u00a0strong\u00a0results. It beat expectations and reported a\u00a0revenue of $43 billion, up 7.6% year-over-year. The net income increased to $2.9 billion, up 26% YOY. The increase\u00a0was driven\u00a0by a rise in truck sales,\u00a0which\u00a0saw a 7.4% YOY jump.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter the strong results, the management has increased the guidance for the year and expects adjusted earnings in the range of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion, up from $12 billion to $14 billion. It also expects a higher free cash flow of $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion.\n\nThe company was pivoting towards electrification, but the sector\u2019s slump\u00a0has left it worried about how to move forward.\u00a0For now, the EV rollout looks like it is on track. However, with a strong presence in the combustion-powered vehicle industry, General Motors can keep growing revenue while finding ground in the EV sector.\n\nTrading at $45, GM looks like an undervalued stock to me. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 1.07%. While it is at the 52-week high, the company has ample potential to expand. It just proved that it\u00a0can\u00a0grow despite competition in the industry. Over half a dozen analysts have raised the stock\u2019s price target after\u00a0strong\u00a0results.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company.

These image problems are slowly vanishing,\u00a0and\u00a0users have started to trust the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobinhood reported record revenue and deposits in the\u00a0first-quarter results. Up 40% YOY, the revenue stood at $618\u00a0million,\u00a0and\u00a0the net deposits reached $11.2 billion. The higher revenue\u00a0was driven\u00a0by the crypto revenue,\u00a0which\u00a0more than tripled.\u00a0This\u00a0was its second straight profitable quarter with net income at $157 million.\n\nTwo important metrics impressed investors. The subscribers increased by 42% YOY, a 500,000 increase to end the quarter with 1.7 million users,\u00a0and\u00a0the average revenue per user hit $104, up 35% YOY.\u00a0This\u00a0is impressive growth,\u00a0and\u00a0long-term investors should focus on the fact that Robinhood is seeing steady user growth. The company has always aggressively acquired users, and its efforts have paid off. Its monthly active users also reported a 16% jump.\n\nOnce a brokerage platform, the company has moved toward offering unique financial products and services that have attracted new users. It already has over 1 million users on the 3% cash-back credit card waitlist.\n\nTrading at $17 today, HOOD is an undervalued sleeper stock that can double over the next 12 months. The stock is up 12% YTD and 125% in the past\u00a0six\u00a0months. The concerns about the\u00a0Wells notice\u00a0are overblown,\u00a0and\u00a0an upside from the current level is\u00a0certain.\n\nRobinhood is one of the best fintech stocks to own as the economy improves.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nChinese automaker Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has been a frontrunner in the electric vehicle race since 2023. The company impressed the market with\u00a0strong\u00a0delivery numbers and fundamentals. However, the slump in the industry since the beginning of the year slowed its momentum. Li Auto might be down,\u00a0but\u00a0it is not out,\u00a0and\u00a0the undervalued sleeper stock has the potential to generate multi-bagger returns.\n\nLi Auto has launched\u00a0Li L6, a five-seater premium family SUV, and\u00a0is set\u00a0to launch lower-priced Li L7 and Li L8 variants this month. The company is steadily working on the launch of new models, which helps improve deliveries. In April, it reported deliveries of\u00a025,787 vehicles, up 0.4% YOY.\n\nLi Auto ended the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $14.6 billion and a revenue of $5.88 billion, up 136% YOY. The liquidity allows the company to aim for higher growth, and it hasn\u2019t considered global expansion yet. If Li Auto aims to go\u00a0global, it will see massive growth across EV markets.\n\nTrading at $27 today, the stock has dropped 21% YTD and gone from the high of $45 to $27.\u00a0This\u00a0is your chance to grab the multi-bagger before it explodes. My InvestorPlace colleague,\u00a0Faisal\u00a0Humayun,\u00a0thinks\u00a0the stock could double before the end of the year.\n\nNew launches, healthy delivery growth, and strong fundamentals make Li an ideal addition to your portfolio. The company reports first-quarter earnings on May 20.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nMeme stocks are grabbing headlines once again.\n\nHousehold names that captured investors' imaginations in 2021 \u2014 like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) \u2014 are surging higher (and lower, in some cases).\n\nAnd while the sudden appearance of meme stock volatility was once a contrary, risk-off warning for stocks in years past, the 2024 surges appear to be signaling a healthy risk appetite for investments.\n\nIn a critical break from prior trading epochs, much of the recent meme stock volatility is being fueled by material news and fundamentals, like earnings, as opposed to Reddit (RDDT) posts.\n\nIn an ode to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks that have captivated investors' imaginations \u2014 and tried their patience at times \u2014 we selected seven retail-oriented, well-known names that, at one time or another, were designated meme stocks in the spirit of the prevailing zeitgeist.\n\nNot surprisingly, the top of the list features the big two, GameStop and AMC. To those, we add: Carvana (CVNA), Beyond Meat (BYND), Kodak (KODK), Palantir (PLTR), and Coinbase (COIN).\n\nTo see the clusters of volatility in these seven names, we measured the trailing quarter volatility and aggregated any big moves (at least three standard deviations or more to be precise), both up and down, for all seven names over a rolling window of five days.\n\nThe high in the series is 14 and was observed on Jan. 28, 2021 \u2014 the very peak of GameStop frenzy.\n\nWhen these meme stock signals are superimposed on a chart of the S&P 500, they can at times appear to presciently warn of an imminent general market reversal.\n\nThis was the case during the 2022 bear market and start of the next bull (highlighted by the red square), when meme volatility preceded four downturns in the general market.\n\nOver this period, when meme stocks surged and grabbed headlines, it was simply a case of laggards catching up. New longs were swiftly met with a sharp reversal that punished the dip-buyers.\n\nContrastingly, since the October 2023 lows, the volatility signals don't appear to have predictive value about the general market. One might happily conclude that this is simply a risk-on bull market in which a rising market tide brings up meme stocks too.\n\nIf your portfolio is up this year, you might not need seven meme stocks to tell you the market is healthy.\n\nBasing a stock's performance on earnings and fundamentals as opposed to, well, memes means that quarterly results actually may matter. Which Palantir investors, seeing the stock down 14% Tuesday after Monday's results, learned the hard way.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd now, on Wednesday, two key players step up to deliver more meme-centric quarterly results: Robinhood, the original accelerant-turned-villain of the movement, and blue-chip meme stock AMC. They follow not only Palantir, but perhaps the original source of the whole meme movement \u2014 Reddit, which reported for the first time as a public company Tuesday. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "GameStop Warning: Why GME Is a No-Brainer Gaming Stock to Sell",
        "content": "Struggling video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has seen a very protracted decline from the height of meme stock mania roughly three years ago. I know, it seems like it was just yesterday. Recent speculation has boosted GME stock by 17% recently.\n\nMuch of this rise has to do with some very dovish commentary (relative to what the market was expecting) from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nAnticipation around potential rate cuts (instead of hikes) pushed many investors to move up the risk curve.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop is about as far up the risk curve as you can go, hence the outsized move.\n\nThis comes as GameStop has struggled to transition online, leading to an 18% stock drop after its recent disappointing Q4 2023 results.\n\nThe company reported earnings of 22 cents, missing Wall Street estimates, with hardware/accessories down 12%, software down 31%. Sales decline due to online game purchases.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into what to make of this very volatile price action in the stock, and whether investors are making a right move by trading this stock in either direction.\n\nSliding Sales and GME Stock\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned earnings numbers, a recent SEC filing also revealed that the company has laid off some of its workforce due to sales drops.\n\nThis puts GME in a lousy light despite plans and hopes of boosting profitability through such cost-cutting measures.\n\nIn Q4 2023, these cost-cutting initiatives were followed by declining sales. That makes sense \u2013 it\u2019s hard to grow if you\u2019re cutting locations and headcount, particularly in the retail world.\n\nFrom $2.2 billion, GameStop only saw a $1.7 billion in revenue for the quarter. Other console makers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Sony (NYSE:SONY), and Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), which shifted to digital downloads, greatly impacted GameStop\u2019s sales.\n\nDownloadable video games have clearly negatively affected GameStop\u2019s sales. Besides GameStop, its peers like Nintendo, saw a drastic drop in hardware sales of 7.8%.\n\nAnalysts and investors also showed concern over Ryan Cohen, GME\u2019s CEO, who plans to continue investing in cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-related stocks.\n\nThey fear that this might cause a greater decline for the company, especially now that it has seen 39% decline since the beginning of 2024.\n\nWedbush\u2019s analysis forecasts GameStop\u2019s demise by 2029 after poor Q4 results. More than cost-cutting is needed, with a yearly revenue drop of $150-$200 million.\n\nThe retailer struggles to offset declining game sales, and until the cash burn stops and there\u2019s a positive cash flow story to talk about, many fundamental investors will continue to avoid this name.\n\nStory continues\n\nGames Are Depreciating\n\nGameStop\u2019s revenue fell in the holiday quarter because of e-commerce competition, reduced spending, and declining software sales. Inflation affected hardware, accessories, and collectible sales.\n\nAs a meme stock, this is a company that\u2019s trading based almost solely on speculative sentiment in the market at any given time.\n\nThe fact is, the gaming market is depreciating in value. Most console operators sell these games online, and GameStop\u2019s lack of a shift to another business model really reminds me of BlockBuster.\n\nI\u2019m not alone, and that\u2019s why the stock is so heavily shorted, which portends well for short squeezes.\n\nThe thing is, given GameStop\u2019s size relative to its true value, I think it\u2019s going to be much harder for another squeeze to take place from a technical perspective.\n\nBetter Sell GME Stock Now\n\nThis top meme stock certainly created a tremendous amount of buzz due to its 2021 short squeeze.\n\nHowever, with that debacle in the rear view mirror, it\u2019s becoming more and more clear that this is a company that\u2019s headed toward bankruptcy. I just don\u2019t see a way out, other than a major pivot the company has yet to pursue.\n\nFor those looking to ride this momentum higher, be careful. I think more downside is ahead over time, and it may be a slower and steadier bleed than many are anticipating.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Even Worse than Gamestop? 3 Meme Stocks That Are Screaming Sells",
        "content": "You\u2019ll get no argument from me that GameStop (NYSE:GME) is one of the best meme stocks to sell. However, the video game retailer has been around a long time, suggesting it\u2019s not the worst of the meme stocks to sell.\n\nSo who is?\n\nQuiverQuant.com provides data on the top meme stocks in U.S. stock exchanges. One of its data points is the WallStreetBets score, based on the number of times a company is mentioned on the subreddit over the past week.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop has a 95 rating out of 100, which is quite high. Eight others have scores higher than 95. Those would be good candidates for meme stocks to sell.\n\nThere are other stocks with lower scores that I would sell in a heartbeat, such as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which clocks in at 94. I won\u2019t select it because I\u2019m tired of getting emails from AMC bulls complaining about my lack of objectivity. Crap is crap.\n\nAnyway, this list of top meme stocks includes some names worth owning. I\u2019ll save these for another time.\n\nImmunityBio (IBRX) Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTE\n\nSource: everything possible / Shutterstock.com\n\nImmunityBio (NASDAQ:IBRX) has a WallStreetBets score of 97, which means it gets a lot of chatter. Many investors may not be familiar with it, but it has a $6.1 billion market capitalization.\n\n\u201cImmunityBio is a vertically integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases,\u201d states the company\u2019s investor relations site,\u201d the company\u2019s investor relations site states.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong founded ImmunityBio in 2014. He is the Executive Chairman and owns nearly 83% of the company through various affiliated businesses. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he\u2019s worth $12.6 billion, up $2.1 billion in 2024.\n\nIf he\u2019s as good at running a biotech firm as a newspaper \u2014 he bought the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million \u2014 you don\u2019t want anything to do with ImmunityBio.\n\nOne benefit of owning the largest paper on the West Coast is that it gets to announce ImmunityBio news. On April 22, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved Antika, the company\u2019s treatment for bladder cancer. As a result, Antika\u2019s shares are up 70% over the past month.\n\nWhile good news, it will have to sell a lot of Antika to eliminate the nearly $3 billion accumulated deficit on its balance sheet.\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) has a WallStreetBets score of 96.\n\nThere was a time when I thought Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor\u2019s strategy of buying Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for his data analytics software business\u2019s balance sheet wasn\u2019t a terrible idea.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Saylor started buying BTC in August 2020, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Funds Effective Rate, or FRED, was 0.10%. Today, it\u2019s 5.33%. With cash balances delivering negligible income, it couldn\u2019t hurt to put excess cash into an appreciating asset. Bitcoin at the time was $11,670. Today, it\u2019s over $58,000.\n\nThe company reported its Q1 2024 results on April 29. They missed on both the top and bottom lines. Its shares fell nearly 10% on the news.\n\nIn February, I argued that MicroStrategy wasn\u2019t a good data analytics stock because Bitcoin obscured its operating business, which isn\u2019t a high-growth enterprise. Its software-related revenue fell 5.5% in the first quarter to $115.2 million.\n\nThe problem is that it went from an operating loss of $20.3 million in Q1 2023 to a $203.7 million loss in the latest quarter. This was because of Bitcoin losses in the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nUnlike Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B), which provides investors with a lower-risk way of owning Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), MicroStrategy does not do the same for Bitcoin.\n\nIf you want to own the cryptocurrency, buy it directly or purchase one of the many Bitcoin trusts.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RMBL) has a WallStreetBets score of 63, well below GameStop\u2019s 95 score. I picked Rumble because it\u2019s another example of misguided loyalty to all things Donald Trump.\n\nThe good news if you bought RUM stock at the beginning of the year is that you\u2019re up more than 55% year-to-date. The bad news is this is about as good as it will get. The stock got as high as $18.52 in February 2022. It remains well down from its 2022 highs despite this year\u2019s gains.\n\nThe gains in 2024 are two-fold: First, the same people gobbling up Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT) stock also buy Rumble because of its video partnership with Truth Social, TMTG\u2019s social media platform. Secondly, it signed a partnership with Barstool Sports that puts all of Barstool Sports\u2019 content on the Rumble platform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about Rumble\u2019s commitment to sports and broadening audiences,\u201d said Dave Portnoy, Founder of Barstool Sports. \u201cWith the power of Barstool Sports, we are going to help Rumble be the top player in the video, cloud, and livestreaming space.\u201d\n\nIt all sounds terrific. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nIn 2023, Rumble generated $81 million, which is a heck of a lot more than Trump Media, but it was flat quarter to quarter while losing nearly $136 million in the past year, or $1.68 per dollar of sales, up from 91 cents per dollar of sales in 2022.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve is finally winning the war against inflation; that\u2019s at least what the latest economic report says, but should still keep in mind that there are retail stocks to avoid. The U.S. economy slowed down sharply in the first-quarter (Q1), growing by just 1.6%, a dramatic drop from the 3.4% growth in the prior-year period. That statistic spells trouble for retail stocks, with consumer spending waning amidst weaker economic momentum.\u00a0 Hence, it\u2019s probably the right time for investors to consider the retail stocks to avoid.\n\nTo be fair, the retail stocks discussed in the article have been struggling for a while now. Their problems, though, are likely to be compounded further, given a challenging economic environment. With that said, here are three retail stocks to offload from your portfolios.\n\nRetail Stocks to Avoid: GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME stock) logo on the outside of a store\n\nSource: Emil O / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME)\u00a0has been criticized extensively over the years, and though it may seem sadistic to continue doing so, it keeps providing reasons for it. The meme stock favorite is nothing more than a catalyst for short sellers and Reddit users to spark short-lived market surges. Overall, though, GME stock has shed more than 74% of its value in the past three years and more than 40% last year alone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, GameStop\u2019s business remains a mess despite its management\u2019s best efforts to spark a turnaround. I was all ears when it announced a shift towards a digital-first approach, in line with the broader market trends. Ironically, despite its shift toward digital, GameStop\u2019s recent quarterly results have shown a decline in software sales. Its software sales slid 31% in its fourth-quarter (Q4), with a 12% drop in hardware sales. Overall sales were down almost 20% in the quarter to $1.79 billion, missing estimates by $256 million. Moreover, it was the fifth time it missed revenue estimates in the past seven quarters. \u00a0Despite its troubling financials, GME stock trades at more than 395 times forward earnings.\n\nLands\u2019 End (LE) The logo for Lands' End is displayed on a retail storefront.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nLands\u2019 End (NASDAQ:LE) has been an American multi-channel retailer for over 60 years. It specializes in casual apparel, accessories, shoes, and home products and has a sizable online presence in addition to its established brick-and-mortar operations.\n\nThe company has witnessed a marked slowdown in top-and-bottom-line growth over the past few years, suffering from debt. It still attracts a financial strength rating of just 5 out of 10 from Gurufocus, with an Altman Z-Score\u00a0that\u2019shovering between Distress and Grey.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, plenty of excitement surrounds the stock under its new management, with its stock gaining almost 95% last year. It has also kept up the pace this year, gaining over 45% year-to-date (YTD). With decreased clearance inventory sales, effective cost control, and a focus on high-quality sales, the firm swung to a profit in Q4.\n\nThough its management is delivering, the rally seems overdone at this point. The broader market is in the negative, while LE stock is up almost 28% this month alone. A pullback is likely, and waiting on the sidelines for a better price is best.\n\nStitch Fix (SFIX) Homepage of Stitch Fix (SFIX) website on the display of PC\n\nSource: Sharaf Maksumov / Shutterstock.com\n\nStitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) is an online retailer that\u2019s struggled to find its footing post-pandemic. The firm provides a subscription-based service where users can order apparel online with the option to return them if they don\u2019t meet their expectations. It solved an important pain point, and with the pandemic-led tailwinds at its back, the company soared to new heights in the Covid era. The company posted multiple quarters during the pandemic, adding millions in active customers while growing its sales by double-digit margins.\n\nHowever, with the tailwinds normalizing, the company faces a massive challenge in retaining its client base. It lost more than 100,000 active customers in its most recent quarter, posting negative growth rates since the third-quarter (Q3) of 2023.\u00a0 Moreover, it lowered its 2024 revenue forecast to fall in the $1.29 billion to $1.32 billion range, significantly\u00a0behind the estimated $1.35 billion. SFIX stock is a \u2018moderate sell\u2019 with zero buy ratings, according to analysts.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Sweep From Your Portfolio This Spring",
        "content": "Growth stocks are amazing choices for investors who are willing to take a little bit of added risk in the hopes that an innovative company will achieve above-average growth in revenue and earnings. But equally important is to identify growth stocks to sell should the ones in your portfolio aren\u2019t pulling their weight.\n\nGrowth stocks are popular because they are expanding fast \u2014 at least, the good ones are \u2014 and plugging their profits into growing their businesses even more. That\u2019s why many growth stocks don\u2019t offer dividends or buy back stock, because they are too busy scaling their businesses or expanding via mergers and acquisitions.\n\nGrowth stocks are also often out of whack with their fundamentals \u2014 and that\u2019s something to consider. It\u2019s not entirely unusual to see a growth stock with a high price-to-sales ratio or a price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe other side of the coin to growth stocks are value stocks, which typically are solid, consistent performers that trade at a lower price relative to their fundamentals, and often reward shareholders with dividends or stock buybacks.\n\nIf you\u2019re holding a growth stock that isn\u2019t growing as much as it should, then you\u2019ve probably got a growth stock to sell on your hands.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader can be an ideal tool to help you identify the underperformers as it evaluates stocks based on growth, earnings performance, momentum and other factors.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at some growth stocks to sell. Some of them have strong grades in the Portfolio Grader for growth \u2014 but all of them are underperformers with an overall disappointing grade. Those are the ones that you want be the most cautious with when considering what kind of growth stocks you want to have in your holdings.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) AMC theater in Manhattan, New York City. AMC stock. APE stock\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to really consider AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) a growth stock, but if it is, it\u2019s certainly among the growth stocks to sell. It\u2019s more of a meme stock to me because it was one of those that gained in popularity when retail investors decided to jump into it, GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a few others.\n\nOn top of that, this is a growth stock that\u2019s not growing. While revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, up from $990 million, AMC could not hold on to that momentum.\n\nPreliminary Q1 figures show that AMC plans to post revenue of $951.4 million, a drop from $954.4 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAMC is also expected to post a loss of $163.5 million and 62 cents per share, versus a loss of $235.5 million and $1.71 per share a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC has a debt problem of $4.6 billion that continues to weigh on the company. Some lenders are seeking an extension on that debt payment, but that\u2019s not enough to make me change my mind about AMC stock.\n\nAMC stock is down 51% in 2024. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but an \u201cF\u201d rating overall in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMagna International (MGA) A Magna International (MGA) sign is on the front of a Magna building in Ontario, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMagna International (NYSE:MGA) can do it all with automobiles. The Canadian company can do bodywork, power train modules, electrical systems and interiors. It can even manufacture complete vehicles.\n\nThe company has a partnership with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) to develop a business-to-business platform called SDVerse that would serve as a matchmaking platform for buyers and sellers of embedded automotive software.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the downside. Magna also has a relationship with Fisker (OTCMKTS:FSRN), a struggling electric vehicle company that is just trying to stay out of bankruptcy at this point.\n\nEvercore ISI downgraded MGA stock specifically because of the threat that Fisker poses to Magna\u2019s bottom line.\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter were $10.4 billion, up from $9.5 billion a year ago. An EPS of 94 cents was better than the 33 cents per share that Magna earned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile the earnings performance is OK, Fisker\u2019s threat appears to be priced in to the stock price these days. MGA stock is down 18% this year and it gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlackBerry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackBerry (NASDAQ:BB) made its mark as a maker of smartphones \u2014 it was one of the first devices in which you could get your email, and it was known for having a full keyboard on the device itself \u2014 which made for very small buttons.\n\nBut as other smartphone companies came along with better products that offered customer-pleasing apps and touch screen input, BlackBerry moved away from smartphones and to a software and services company.\n\nIt currently provides mobile device management, cybersecurity and software for autonomous vehicles.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was $173 million, down from $175 million a year ago. The company posted loss of $56 million and 10 cents per share for the quarter, which was an improvement from its loss of $495 million and 85 cents per share from the same quarter a year ago.\n\nBB stock is down 19% this year, which is why I see it as one of the growth stocks to sell. It gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is there to say about Boeing (NYSE:BA)? There\u2019s not much positive to say for this blue-chip company that is having a horrendous year.\n\nThe maker of the Boeing 737 Max 9 passenger jet is under tremendous pressure ever since the rear door flue off a jet while in midflight.\n\nFederal investigators grounded the entire fleet for inspection and two airlines reported finding loose screws on their aircraft.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have both been critical of Boeing, and with good reason.\n\nSeveral online tools have popped up in response, showing passengers how to avoid getting on 737 Max when booking their flights.\n\nNone of this is publicity that will help Boeing or BA stock. Boeing is one of the worst performers this year in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe stock is down 32% this year and earns a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square (SQ) logo displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is a technology computer software company. Besides owning the hardware that allows people to process credit card transactions from a smartphone or tablet.\n\nBlock also operates the CashApp finance platform, which is used as an alternative to traditional banks.\n\nIn addition, Block has a significant investment in Bitcoin (BTC-USD), owning over 8,000 of the digital currency.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin jumped 69% in 2024, Block realized $207 million in earnings from its Bitcoin holdings in the fourth quarter of 2023. That\u2019s a huge percentage of the company\u2019s overall $562 million in quarterly revenue.\n\nSo yes, Block is making money. But I\u2019m also concerned that it\u2019s overly reliant on the Bitcoin price to do so. Bitcoin is down 10% in the last month and that doesn\u2019t bode well for SQ earnings when it next reports.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s rise was the only reason Block registered a profit for the 2023 fiscal year. It needs to find another way to profit should Bitcoin continue to slide in 2024.\n\nSQ stock is down 11% in 2024. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too long ago that MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) carried an \u201cA\u201d grade in the Portfolio Grader, but time has not treated the e-commerce company favorably. This is a prime example of why it\u2019s important to review your portfolio regularly.\n\nMercadoLibre operates an e-commerce and digital marketplace. Not only does it handle over 21% of all e-commerce sales in Latin America, but it serves as a payment processor for people who don\u2019t want to use a traditional bank.\n\nHowever, MELI looks like it\u2019s turning things around. First-quarter earnings reported May 2 showed net revenues up 36% from a year ago, and net income up 90%.\n\nMELI stock is down 6% in 2024, though that may be changing as the stock is up 3.6% in after-hours trading after reporting earnings on Thursday afternoon. It gets an \u201cA\u201d rating for growth but a \u201cD\u201d overall grade in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nLamb Weston (LV) Louis Vuitton storefront featuring an LV handbag.

In North America, the company reported that sales volume was down by 8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 because of the transition to a new enterprise resources planning system that reduced the visibility of inventory at distribution centers \u2014 leaving the company unable to fulfill orders.\n\nThat\u2019s a painful problem because Lamb Western had the product but couldn\u2019t sell it \u2014 and it potentially hurt its relationships with those disappointed customers.\n\nLW stock is down 22% in 2024 and gets a \u201cB\u201d rating for growth and a \u201cD\u201d overall grade in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in\u00a0LW.

        "content": "In the era of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), many retailers have gone bankrupt because they could not compete with the e-commerce juggernaut. And of course, the pandemic-era lockdowns causing many retailers to become saddled with gargantuan debt did not help. In just the last several years multiple, once major, companies have all gone belly up. The most recent victim to file for Chapter 11 was Express (OTC:EXPR). It\u2019s possible that, given the company\u2019s reliance on selling clothes worn in offices, the work-from-home trend badly damaged the retailer. Express was also hurt by high debt and expensive leases. Here are three retailers that could easily be among the next to go bankrupt, making them retail stocks to avoid.\n\nStitch Fix (SFIX) Homepage of Stitch Fix (SFIX) website on the display of PC\n\nSource: Sharaf Maksumov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor any company, declining net customer totals is definitely a very bad sign. So the fact that Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX), which sells apparel online, lost a net total of 6% of its customer base in Q2 2024 is definitely a good reason to avoid SFIX stock. And compared with the same period a year earlier, Stitch Fix shed 17% of its users during the quarter.\r\n\r\nGiven the firm\u2019s declining customer totals, I\u2019m not surprised that its sales fell 17.5% year-over-year in Q2 .\n\nFor the third quarter, which ended on April 27, SFIX expects an adjusted EBITDA of potentially -$5 million. So it appears that the retailer may be heading into the red even on an adjusted EBITDA basis.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd indicating that the Street is losing patience with the name, the shares have tumbled 40% so far this year.\n\nPeloton (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome may dispute my decision to categorize Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) as a retailer. But since the firm does have physical stores and sell its products to consumers, I view it primarily as a retailer.\n\nLike Stitch Fix, Peloton\u2019s customer base is shrinking which is never a good sign for any company. Specifically, in Peloton\u2019s fiscal Q2 2024, its total membership declined 4% year-over-year (YOY) to 6.4 million. Meanwhile, its paid app subscription total fell 16% YOY to 718,000. And in another negative development, its top line dropped 6% YOY.\n\nOn a positive note, the amount of its cash burned by operating activities did sink 65% to $31.2 million in Q2. Still, given the meaningful declines of its customer base, I believe that the company will have difficulty shrinking its loss much further. That\u2019s particularly true because the improvement in its cash burn was entirely due to a large, 14% YOY decline in its operating expenses. As is well known, the extent to which firms can cut their expenses is always limited.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeloton\u2019s long-overdue decision to start selling its products through third parties, including Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) and Amazon, bore fruit, as Peloton\u2019s revenue from those channels jumped 74% YOY in Q2. And its partnership with lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), established last September, could pay off too.\n\nBut given its continued, sizeable cash burn, revenue declines and customer losses, along with its $1.6 billion of net debt, I think that these positive moves will probably be a case of \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d for Peloton. This places PTON firmly among the retail stocks you will want to avoid.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nIn the wake of GameStop\u2019s (NYSE:GME) poor Q4 results, investment bank Wedbush predicted that the retailer would not survive past 2029.\n\nThe bank believes that the firm\u2019s top-line will probably sink by $150 million to $200 million annually, while GameStop will probably not be able to cut its costs sufficiently to compensate for those declines. The retailer\u2019s main problem is that it does not appear to have found a way to compensate for its declining video-game sales, Wedbush explained.\n\nFor Q4, GameStop\u2019s revenue came in at $1.078 billion, down from $1.186 billion during the same period a year earlier. Its operations burned a huge $203.7 million of cash during the quarter.\n\nGameStop\u2019s declining revenue and poor outlook definitely make it one of the retail stocks to avoid at all costs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the13 Best Reddit Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Reddit Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nMillions of young retail investors turn to Reddit every day to talk or learn about the stock market. Back in the pandemic days, the rise of zero-commission stock trading apps and excessive cash allowed Redditors to build a strong investing community which went on to spar with hedge funds over shorted stocks like GameStop and AMC. Those days marked a turning point in the retail investing landscape. Data shows that millions of young Americans today use social media for investing advice. A report by FINRA Investor Education Foundation says that about 60% of investors aged 18\u201334 take investing advice from social media, compared to just 35% aged 35\u201354 and only 8% aged 55 and older.\n\nCan Reddit Stock Picks Beat The Market?\n\nBut with the pandemic in rear view, Wall Street has an important question to answer: does following Reddit investing threads and investing in stocks bought by retail investors on the platform actually bring any profits? A research paper titled Financial Recommendations on Reddit, Stock Returns and Cumulative Prospect Theory analyzes Reddit's stock picks to answer this question from various angles. The paper said that investing in stocks recommended on famous Reddit investing communities like WallStreetBets, Investing and Stocks creates a portfolio with \"higher average returns at the expense of higher risks than the market for all holding periods, i.e., unfavorable Sharpe ratios.\"\n\nWhat Happened After the GME, AMC Short Squeeze Events?\n\nAn interesting research paper titled Place Your Bets? The Market Consequences of Investment Research on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetbets analyzed the stock returns of Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, which rose to fame following the GameStop saga. WallStreetBets users often write posts tagged \"DD (Due Diligence).\" These reports often analyze stocks in detail and conclude by giving a clear buy or sell signal. These are usually serious analysis-based posts, unlike meme-like, funny posts that are now ubiquitous on the platform. The research paper analyzed 5,015 DD reports and 13,255 non-research related WSB posts issued between July 2018 and June 2021. The results show that before the GME event, WSB stock recommendations resulted in stock gains. But after the GME and AMC events, these gains fell and the platform saw a clear tilt towards volatile stocks with high short interest.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We find DD reports are significant predictors of future returns. For example, an incremental DD buy recommendation is associated with a 5.17% increase in one-month ahead returns for the full sample and a 2.33% increase after excluding GME and AMC.\"\n\nThe report also said that the success of Redditors during their battle with hedge funds over GME and AMC attracted a lot of new users, who started focusing too much on factors not relevant to fundamentals, cash flow and valuations.\n\n\"We also document a positive relation in the pre-GME period between DD reports and future media sentiment, earnings surprises, and analyst earnings forecast revisions, which points to the possibility that at least a portion of the return predictability associated with DD reports in the pre-GME period is attributable to forecasting future cash-flow news. However, in the post-GME period, the positive relation between DD reports and cash-flow news is fully eliminated, and in some cases, it even becomes significantly negative.\"\n\nHowever, there has been a clear and noticeable change in Redditors' stock preferences, especially on serious, analysis-focused subreddits like Investing, Stocks, etc. Redditors no longer emphasize on investing in meme stocks. Instead, they prefer high-quality stocks with growth fundamentals, low-risk index funds and mutual funds. Best Reddit Stocks to Buy Now\n\nbrett-jordan-0FytazjHhxs-unsplash Methodology\n\nFor this article we scoured investing-related subreddits on Reddit and listed down all stocks that Redditors are bullish on. From these stocks we picked 13 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Insider Monkey\u2019s monthly newsletter and\u00a0portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs\u2019 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.\n\n13. British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nRedditors like British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) because of its dividend, low valuation multiples and stability. British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) recently increased its dividend by 6.1%\n\nRecently, JPMorgan published its list of European dividend stocks which has sustainable dividend yields. British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI) made it to the list.\n\nBroyhill Asset Management stated the following regarding British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe largest detractors to performance over the quarter were LatAm airports (ASR, OMAB, PAC), Bayer, and\u00a0British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI). After years investing across the tobacco sector, it became increasingly clear that owning anything other than the global leader \u2013 Philip Morris \u2013 made little sense. Consequently, we liquidated our investment in British American Tobacco after deciding that the (seemingly) cheap valuation wasn\u2019t worth the mental anguish. In a hollow victory, shortly after our sale, management promptly wrote down the value of its US tobacco brands by $31.5 billion, sending shares cratering.\u201d\n\n12. SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\n\nSoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI)\u00a0is one of the all-time favorite stocks of Reddit. Redditors are bullish on SoFi Technologies Inc's\u00a0(NASDAQ:SOFI)\u00a0revenue growth in the future.\n\n11. Owens Corning (NYSE:OC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 39\n\nComposite materials company Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) ranks 11th in our list of the best Reddit stocks to buy now. \u00a0Redditors like the stock because they believe it\u2019s undervalued and Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) has a solid and growing business.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Owens Corning\u00a0(NYSE:OC).\n\n10. Crocs Inc (NASDAQ:CROX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\n\nCrocs\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:CROX)\u00a0is one of the best Reddit stocks to buy for 2024 and beyond. Redditors think Crocs\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:CROX)\u00a0is undervalued and has strong operating margins. Retail investors on Reddit also said Crocs\u00a0Inc's (NASDAQ:CROX)\u00a0growth in Asia looks strong and it\u2019s still in infancy and growth mode.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Crocs\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:CROX).\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThis quarter we entered four new positions, while exiting four positions. Our largest new position was\u00a0Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX). Crocs is a well-known consumer brand in the footwear industry. Despite continual calls over the years as a fad, Crocs has shown impressive growth and staying power. Since 2017 the company has increased sales at a 20%compound annual growth rate (CAGR) while maintaining industry leading operating margins of 27%. The stock sold off recently as the HEYDUDE brand it purchased in 2022 faced challenges. A combination of market oversaturation, and still limited brand awareness has made HEYDUDE a drag on the overall business. This is more than priced in at current levels with the stock trading at a P/E of 8.5x below peers at 14.3x and their historical average of 15x since 2019. The company is making progress on fixing HEYDUDE with growth expected to return in the 2H24. Overall, we view the child piece of the core Crocs product as a consumer staple and believe people are underappreciating its staying power as well as the ongoing improvements in the HEYDUDE brand. We believe you can buy a high-quality company, at a low multiple, with top FCF yield (13%) that is committed to both debt paydown and buybacks.\u201d\n\n9. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nCostco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0is one of the top stocks Redditors are recommending to buy in 2024. Some of the reasons why Redditors love Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0include dividends and solid business that remains resilient despite the broader market volatility. While discussing Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0stock in the subreddit \u201cStocks\u201d a Redditor explained why he likes Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST):\n\n\u201cQuality business. Subscription service. Huge revenue. Can turn up their prices without losing any customers probably. Good business model. Happy workers. Happy customers. Room for growth in other countries. Price to free cash flow is around 30. Not cheap, not super expensive. Don\u2019t look at PE alone.\u201d\n\nHedge funds agree with Redditors. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). The biggest stakeholder of Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\u00a0was Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.8 billion stake in Costco\u00a0Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST).\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported solid holiday results and announced a special dividend of $15 per share. Earnings were better than expected driven by better gross margin. Same store sales were 3.9% with solid traffic. Costco also noted better discretionary trends and solid seasonal sales.\u201d\n\n8. Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 79\n\nRedditors think Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) has not been getting much love lately because the market seems to think Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) might never be able to gain back its glory days of the pandemic. But retail investors on Reddit think Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) has long-term growth catalysts and the future outlook for Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) looks strong. On a latest discussion thread, a Redditor commented about Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE):\n\n\u201cIt's almost entirely because their covid drug revenue is going down faster than people anticipated. The thing is, their stock price has gone down so much that it makes no sense. Their 2024 and 2025 estimates all look quite good. That's why I'm buying more during this dip.\u201d\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAmong our bottom contributors in Q4 were BorgWarner and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Biopharmaceutical company Pfizer was pressured as COVID sales were slower than expected in Q4. However, outside COVID-related sales, the base business is performing as expected, and the company is starting a cost-cutting program that should restore margins to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to like Pfizer for its diversified business, strong cash flow generation capabilities and balance sheet, and solid leadership under a quality CEO.\u201d\n\n7. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 86\n\nContracts from the US government, new fabrication plants Ohio, Germany and Israel, partnership with ARM and AI are some of the top reasons why Redditors love Intel\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:INTC).\n\nHere is an interesting comment on Reddit that sums up long-term thesis on\u00a0Intel\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:INTC):\n\n\"I think the thesis on Intel hasn\u2019t changed since 2022. The \u201ccatalyst\u201d will be when/if they successfully launch intel 3, 20A, and 18A and if they land some big foundry customers. That will send them back above 60\n\nThis isn\u2019t a one day, one quarter, or even one year play. It\u2019s a 2-3 year play, minimum. My horizon on intel is through 2030.\"\n\nUpslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) \u2013 New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require \u201cprotection\u201d for Upslope\u2019s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.\u201d\n\n6. Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 87\n\nWhile there\u2019s no shortage of Redditors skeptical of Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), an overwhelming number of retail investors on the social media platform believe Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u00a0shares will gain value in the future. Many investors on Reddit think Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u00a0is going through a transition and Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u00a0would come back to normal in the months to come.\n\nHedge funds are also bullish on the stock. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 87 hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database had stakes in Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), up from 78 funds in the previous quarter.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company\u2019s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal\u2019s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal\u2019s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Reddit Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Reddit Stocks with Biggest Upside 12 Best Reddit Stocks To Buy Now 10 Reddit Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 most popular retail investor stocks in 2024. If you want to skip our introduction to how retail trading has changed over these past couple of years and some recent trends, then you can check out 5 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024.\n\nThe stock market of 2024 is quite different from the one present at the turn of the millennium. This is because the internet and consumer technology have made vast sums of information available to anyone willing to learn. As a result, more people are able to invest in the stock market, and this trend soared during the coronavirus pandemic. While the pandemic is known for the devastating disease and the lock downs, at the same time, it also put retail investors for the first time on Wall Street's map. This happened through the meme stock mania, which saw popular companies GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC) soar on the stock market as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the shares in bulk.\n\nThe rise of retail investors has also introduced a new angle to investing. Professional investors, like hedge funds, only have one objective in mind when making their decisions. This is profit maximization, whether the shares are bought long, sold short, or held to force a change at the firm as is with activist investing. On the flip side, retail investors, while also naturally influenced by the profit motive, also invest in stocks that they like. For instance, hedge funds had sold GameStop short and negatively influenced its share price because they remained unconvinced about the traditional brick and mortar retailer's ability to compete in the digital new world dominated by virtual video game downloads offered by platforms run by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The retail camp, on the other hand, had also invested in GameStop because of their attachment to the brand.\n\n2024 is seeing this bifurcation between retail and professional investors surface once again. One of the hottest, and most volatile, stocks this year has been Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT). Like GameStop before it, DJT's investors also have a personal motive for piling into the shares. Retail investors have invested in the stock because they trust the former US President, and have continued to hold the shares even though TMTG battles short sellers. TMTG is a social media company that operates Truth Social, a platform President Trump set up after he was banned from Twitter (now X) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s Facebook. With the US Presidential race for 2024 having kicked off, investors are also battling it out on Wall Street as TMTG stock rises and falls. DJT - the stock - is quite fresh as it commenced trading just earlier this year. Before the merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC) and TMTG, the shares had traded under DWAC and had become a proxy for the former President's daily affairs. Soon after its merger, TMTG shared with investors that it had earned $4 million in income from ads run on its platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock DJT is up 138% year to date, entering the year after TMTG sued press outlets for incorrectly interpreting its financial statements. The fireworks in its share price are also recent, as $DJT's predecessor stock, $DWAC, was flat throughout 2023. Like other special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), DWAC's stock also posted its strongest gains soon after the stock was listed for public trading. Back in October 2021, the stock stunned the market by soaring to $175 and settled to close at $94, the highest in its history. This marked a 1,500% price appreciation in the two trading days after news hit the wires that TMTG was merging with DWAC as the Trump team geared up to launch Truth Social. From its peak close of $94, the shares are down by 55%, after they narrowed the drop to 34% earlier this year after the merger and the ticker change to DJT.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most popular stocks among retail investors. A couple of notable names are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2024\n\nmichael-fortsch-SIz6izQKxzs-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the most popular stocks among retail investors, we used data from the Robinhood Index, Fintel, and Vanda Research to make a list of all the stocks that ordinary traders can't get enough of.\n\nFor these popular retail investor stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment.

        "title": "12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 under the radar stocks with massive upside for 2024. If you want to skip our overview of shareholder ownership and how shares can jump if they come 'over' the radar instead of under, then you can jump ahead to 5 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024.\n\nInvesting in stocks is quite different these days compared to even just a decade back. Broadband internet combined with the rapid boom in personal computing devices, digital banking, and financial technology services allows anyone willing to take the risk to try their hand at stocks. This democratization of the stock market means that as opposed to the Wall Street of the 2000s and the 1990s, now, anyone can set their trading setup, consume information, and see how fate plays out on the S&P 500.\n\nAt the same time, while there are more avenues of trading available, the number of equities that are available for trading also runs in the thousands. For our everyday retail trader, this means that some stocks will always be under the radar as sifting out small and little known companies that might be the next Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might remain out of the spotlight for retail traders. Professional investors such as hedge funds benefit from their significant computing, financial, and human resources which enable them to go through countless firms each day to see which might be poised for growth.\n\nAs a result of all this, and other factors such as management decisions, stocks can also be bifurcated along their ownership structure. Some stocks, such as the mining giant BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) or the American depository receipts of the well known Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are well known among retail investors and also have a large portion of their share ownership represented by them. Data from Refinitiv shows that for BHP, institutional and insider investors own 3.84% of the total shares outstanding, while for Toyota this percentage drops down to just 1.51%. This is unsurprising given that not only do these firms have billions of shares outstanding, but also since they are global brands.\n\nOther stocks are remarkable for their significant institutional and insider ownership. For instance, the software giant Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) has 157.36 million shares outstanding and 155.6 million shares as its float. Despite this, 92% of its stock is held by institutions, ensuring that even if the stock generates substantial hype, it will nevertheless remain under the radar as large numbers of retail investors will remain unable to add the stock to their portfolios and monitor it over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, investing in under the radar stocks can also be quite lucrative. After all, rapid share price appreciations are often driven by a large number of people feeling confident about a stock's future and starting to buy the shares. Perhaps the best example of this and one that's relevant to our discussion of Wall Street's democratization is the stock of the well known video game retailer GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME). Part of the meme stock craze that briefly took over the stock market, GameStop's shares soared in triple digit percentages in the blink of an eye as retail investors joined forces on social media and bought the stock in bulk. This also led to massive losses for hedge funds which had sold the shares short based on the firm's fundamentals, and for a brief time period, it appeared that Wall Street had permanently changed.\n\nSo, which stocks are currently under the radar and are seeing significant upside from analysts? We took a look, with some top picks being Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA). 12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\nA close-up of a laptop monitor with stock market prices scrolling up and down.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best under the radar stocks with significant upside we first made a list of under the radar stocks by sifting through coverage in the financial media. Then, the top 20 stocks with the highest analyst average share price target upside were narrowed down. Finally, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023, and the best under the radar stocks were picked.\n\nFor these top under the radar stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12 Under-the-Radar Stocks With Massive Upside for 2024\n\n12. Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC)\n\nNumber of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 20\n\nAverage Analyst Share Price Target Upside: 71%\n\nConcentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is one of the biggest information technology companies in the world, with close to half a million employees.

Lauren Taylor Wolfe's Impactive Capital was the biggest shareholder due to its $334 million stake.\n\nJust like JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), and Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA), Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ:CNXC) is an under the radar stock with huge upside.\n\n11. Editas Medicine, Inc.

(NYSE:COHR) is another backend semiconductor firm whose products are used in the chip fabrication process.

        "title": "Why Is GameStop (GME) Down 17% Since Last Earnings Report?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for GameStop (GME). Shares have lost about 17% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GameStop due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nGameStop Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales Decline Y/Y\n\nGameStop posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, delivering lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. While the top line declined year over year, the bottom line compared favorably with the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nQ4 in Details\n\nGameStop posted adjusted earnings per share of 22 cents in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents per share. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 16 cents in the prior year quarter.\r\n\r\nGME reported net sales of $1,793.6 million, which missed the consensus estimate of $2,000 million. Also, the metric decreased 19.4% from $2,226.4 million reported in the year-ago fiscal quarter. Lower sales across all the categories contributed to soft sales.\r\n\r\nBy sales mix, hardware and accessories sales fell 11.9% to $1.09 billion from $1.24 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Software sales were $465.3 million, down 30.6% from $670.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales in the collectibles unit declined 25.4% to $233.7 million compared with $313.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMargins\n\nGross profit decreased 16.1% to $419.2 million from $499.8 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. We note that gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 23.4% in the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nAdjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 20.8% to $358.9 million from $452.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 20%, down 30 bps from 20.3% reported in the year-ago period.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s adjusted operating income was $60.3 million in the reported quarter. It had reported an adjusted operating income of $46.9 million in the prior-year fiscal period. We note that the adjusted operating margin increased 130 bps year over year to 3.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nAdjusted EBITDA was $88 million against an adjusted EBITDA of $82.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 bps year over year to 4.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Financial Aspects\n\nGameStop ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $921.7 million, net long-term debt of $17.7 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.34 billion. Net merchandise inventory was $632.5 million at the end of the reported quarter compared with $682.9 million at the close of the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nDuring the 53-week period that ended Feb 3, 2024, the company used cash flow from operations of $203.7 million against an outflow of $108.2 million during the same period last year. Free cash flow during the same period was a negative $238.6 million. Capital expenditures in the 53 weeks amounted to $34.9 million.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -100% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nAt this time, GameStop has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise GameStop has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Stocks That Could Be Heading Six-Feet Under",
        "content": "If you\u2019re wondering what stocks to sell this quarter, you\u2019re in the right place. Nothing lasts forever, not even stocks. During a 2018 all-hands meeting, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder and then CEO Jeff Bezos famously said: \u201cI predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.\u201d Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was on the verge of going bankrupt in 1997 before rival Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) saved the then struggling company with a $150 million investment. History is littered with once famous companies and stocks that no longer exist.\n\nSince the turn of the century, a number of once high-flying stocks have gone the way of the dodo bird. Names such as Blockbuster Video, Pets.com, and Enron, to cite only a few. These companies, and others, failed after losing their competitive edge, being mismanaged or engaging in fraud. So, which stocks are next to disappear? What companies are most in danger of ceasing operations in the near-term. There are plenty of concerns to choose from. Here are seven stocks that could be heading six-feet under.\n\nStocks to Sell: Tilray Brands (TLRY) In this photo illustration Tilray (TLRY) logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nCannabis producer Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is awash in red ink. The company recently reported a quarterly loss of $105 million and lowered its forward guidance as its sales continue to crumble. The company said that it lost 12 cents a share for the fiscal quarter ended Feb. 29. Revenue totalled $188.3 million. While the latest results were better than a loss of $1.20 billion and revenue of $145.6 million recorded a year earlier, the latest earnings print shows that Tilray Brands remains in financial straits.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn terms of guidance, Tilray said that it expects earnings of only $60 million to $63 million for its entire 2024 financial year as its cannabis sales dry up. The newest guidance is down from earlier estimates of $78 million in earnings. Insult to injury, management at Tilray said that they no longer expect positive free cash flow this financial year. TLRY stock continues to slide lower, with the share price dropping 21% after its latest financial results and guidance were made public.\n\nThe stock is now down 97% over the last five years and trading at less than two bucks.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) A white clock indicates it's time to sell.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAside from its association with former president Donald Trump, there\u2019s not much to recommend Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT). The company is barely afloat, having reported a 2023 net loss of $58 million on just $4.1 million in revenues. Since going public in late March of this year through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal, DJT stock has largely collapsed. The share price is currently 60% below its 52-week high and has fallen 50% since March 27 of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nComplicating matters is the huge allotment of stock given to former president Trump. In all, Donald Trump\u2019s stake in the media company stands at $4 billion based on the current share price. He owns more than 100 million. The shares that Donald Trump owns are subject to a lock-up period that prevents him from selling them during the first six months following the company going public. But there is speculation that he will sell his stake in the media company as soon as possible. What happens to DJT stock then?\n\nStocks to Sell: Paramount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s never good when board members resign from a company en masse. But that\u2019s what recently happened at Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) when four board directors announced their departure together. Dawn Ostroff, a former Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) executive; Nicole Seligman, former president of Sony Entertainment (NYSE:SONY); Frederick Terrell, an investment banker; and Rob Klieger, an attorney, are each leaving the board. The resignations come as Paramount Global tries to sell itself.\n\nSince the start of the year, Paramount has been involved in aborted merger talks with Warner Bros. Discovery (NYSE:WBD), received a $26 billion all-cash takeover offer from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) that the board declined, and, most recently, entered into exclusive discussions with privately held Skydance Media about a potential takeover or merger. Skydance has entered into a 30-day exclusive negotiating period with Paramount\u2019s board, though a deal is not guaranteed.\n\nIf all goes well, Paramount Global will be purchased, taken private, and its stock delisted. Or, a merged company could survive as different publicly traded entity. What is clear at this point is that Paramount\u2019s future looks tentative at best. PARA stock is down 75% over the last five years, including a 43% decline in the last 12 months.\n\nNordstrom (JWN) Bright red graphic of stock arrow headed sharply downward beside downward bar graph. Stocks to Never Buy\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nSpeaking of going private, the family behind U.S. department store chain Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has created a special committee to evaluate bids aimed at taking the department store chain private. This as the 123-year-old company struggles with a decline in sales as shopping increasingly moves online. Last summer, Nordstrom closed all of its locations in Canada after less than a decade in the country, shutting down multiple outlets following huge liquidation sales.\n\nThe special committee has been set-up to evaluate proposals aimed at taking Nordstrom private, delisting JWN stock in the process. The company has been down this road before. In 2017, private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners came close to taking Nordstrom private but the deal fell through because of a dispute over price. The latest take private action comes after Nordstrom-issued weak guidance for the year ahead amid soft demand, lagging sales, bloated inventory levels, and increasing markdowns.\n\nJWN stock is down 52% over the past five years.\n\nStocks to Sell: GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that video game retailer and meme stock favorite GameStop (NYSE:GME) was talking about becoming the \u201cAmazon of gaming.\u201d Such talk has since faded amid a failed turnaround strategy, successive earnings misses, and ongoing share price declines. Despite repeated efforts, GameStop has not managed to move its business online and meaningfully shrink its retail chain of video game stores that are seeing less foot traffic.\n\nAt the end of March, GME stock plunged 18% after the company reported weak financial results for the final quarter of 2023 that included the year-end holiday shopping season. GameStop announced earnings of 22 cents and revenue of $1.79 billion. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of 30 cents per share and sales of $2.05 billion. Hardware and accessories sales fell 12% year-over-year while software sales declined 31% in the quarter. The company\u2019s sales have steadily eroded as consumers purchase games online.\n\nThe newest turnaround plan will see GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen invest the company\u2019s excess cash in stocks and cryptocurrencies, a move that has made more than a few analysts and investors cringe. In the last 12 months, GME stock has fallen 49%, including a 39% pullback so far in 2024.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Smartphone with logo of Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth Corporation on screen in front of web page. Cannabis plants are in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nCanopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) is another cannabis producer that is in dire straits and has landed itself on this stocks to sell list. In recent months, the company has sold its corporate headquarters, issued more stock to raise money, and placed part of its business under creditor protection. Canopy Growth\u2019s latest earnings showed a net loss of $216.8 million. That compares with a net loss of $264.4 million a year earlier. Revenue for what was the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter totalled $78.5 million, down 8% from $84.9 million a year earlier.\n\nCanopy Growth continues to struggle with declining sales and a loss of market share. Over the past five years, CGC stock has plunged 98%. Last December, the company executed a reverse stock split to artificially raise its share price. The company consolidated its shares on a one-for-10 basis on Dec. 15. Reverse stock splits are, rightfully, seen by markets as an act of desperation by companies that are trying to artificially boost their share price, often to avoid being delisted from a stock exchange, in this case the Nasdaq.\n\nExpress (EXPRQ) Photo of stair of coins with red arrow headed downward over top of the coin stacks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Pla2na\n\nClothing retailer Express (OTC:EXPRQ), a fixture at American shopping malls, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to close more than 100 stores. The company, whose portfolio of brands includes Bonobos and UpWest Express, listed assets of $1 billion against liabilities of $10 billion in its bankruptcy filing. As part of the bankruptcy process, the company is closing 95 Express retail stores and about a dozen UpWest stores. In all, the company operates 530 Express retail and Express Factory Outlet stores nationwide.\n\nIn business since 1980, Express has struggled with slowing consumer spending and a shift to online shopping. The company said that it has received a commitment for $35 million in new financing from existing lenders and plans to conduct business as usual while it goes through a restructuring process. Privately held brand management firm WHP Global, which owns fashion label Anne Klein, took a 7.4% stake in Express last year. But to look at the stock price, it appears to be only a matter of time for Express.\n\nThis year alone, EXPRQ stock has fallen 90% and now trades deep down on the penny stock league tables, making it one of those stocks to sell ASAP.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Spotting Winners: Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) And Specialty Retail Stocks In Q4\n\nAs the Q4 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the specialty retail industry, including Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA) and its peers.\n\nSome retailers try to sell everything under the sun, while others\u2014appropriately called Specialty Retailers\u2014focus on selling a narrow category and aiming to be exceptional at it. Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1%. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, though the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and specialty retail stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 11.1% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nUlta (NASDAQ:ULTA)\n\nOffering high-end prestige brands as well as lower-priced, mass-market ones, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is an American retailer that sells makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products.\n\nUlta reported revenues of $3.55 billion, up 10.2% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company:\u00a0Ulta beat analysts' same store sales, revenue, and gross margin expectations. On the other hand, while full year revenue guidance was roughly in line, its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed. Ulta Total Revenue\n\nUlta achieved the fastest revenue growth and highest full-year guidance raise of the whole group. The stock is down 26.9% since the results and currently trades at $413.5.\n\nIs now the time to buy Ulta?

It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue estimates, driven by significant underperformance in its software segment ($465m of revenue vs estimates of $670m).\n\nGameStop had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The stock is down 32.5% since the results and currently trades at $10.48.\n\nRead our full analysis of GameStop's results here.\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY)\n\nWith humble beginnings as a stereo equipment seller, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) now sells a broad selection of consumer electronics, appliances, and home office products.\n\nBest Buy reported revenues of $14.65 billion, down 0.6% year on year, in line with analyst expectations.

        "content": "Buying stocks up over 200% in 2024 is a tricky proposition. On one hand, you don\u2019t want to fight momentum. Plenty of shorts have been burned trying to time a reversal in momentum for hot stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even former meme stock megalith Gamestop (NYSE:GME). Likewise, plenty of bulls have gotten cut trying to catch a falling knife, hoping for a resurgence. Still, determining which stocks will keep pumping and which \u2014 like Gamestop \u2014 are a dumpster fire is tough.\n\nEach of these three stocks, up over 200% in 2024, slashes that opposing sentiment, though. All have bullish tailwinds propelling them higher, with unique factors helping buffer against wider market meltdowns. In other words, it may not be too late to ride the momentum even higher despite their existing 200%+ surge thus far.\n\nMediaCo Holding (MDIA) Radio microphone in a soundproofed room with an \"on air\" sign in the background.\n\nSource: radioshoot/ShutterStock.com\n\nMediaCo Holding (NASDAQ:MDIA) is a terrestrial radio and broadcasting media stock \u2014 not something you\u2019d think would surge more than 200% ever, let alone in just a few short months. But, bucking expectations, this stock surged 361% since January 1st.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA fair amount of MediaCo\u2019s recent gains came on the heels of an announcement that hedge fund Standard General LP snagged a sizeable 95% stake in the firm. Bordering on full-blown acquisition territory, the move telegraphed two messages to investors. First, hedge fund CEO Soohyung Kim is betting big on MediaCo\u2019s future, and second, we can expect some degree of activism from Kim to push per-share pricing higher.\n\nThat shareholder activism may already be bearing fruit, as the company just announced a major acquisition of Estrella Media, diversifying MediaCo\u2019s presence further into Spanish-language demographics and markets. Better yet, new interim CEO Jacqueline Hernandez is a former Telemundo exec who understands what that market needs and how to target it. Massive initial gains in 2024 may be just the beginning for this stock already up over 200%.\n\nRoot (ROOT) A close-up shot of a hand choosing wooden blocks with emoticons related to health insurance. russell 2000 stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRoot (NASDAQ:ROOT) is blowing past our 200% gain benchmark. This stock has already returned nearly twice that in 2024. Root\u2019s stock is soaring because of continued AI enthusiasm and a shockingly strong fourth-quarter earnings report. Root is a digital insurance provider targeting auto owners, renters and homeowners that leverages AI to analyze potential clients and gather real-time driving data to optimize premium management and reduce loss risks.\n\nIn 2023, Root reported a 31% increase in gross written premiums to $783 million, although gross earned premiums dropped 1% to $636 million. The company also halved its net losses to $147 million, marking its best year ever. Analysts swarmed the stock following the breakout, with Jefferies setting the stage by quadrupling its price target and saying the company is \u201csetting a path to profitable growth, market share gains and scalability for a viable business model.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market rewarded Root\u2019s efforts, with its stock climbing 400% since January and a staggering 1,127% over the past year. Though still trudging along a path toward profitability, Root is making significant progress.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) may lag slightly behind our other stocks, but the AI-driven stock has popped more than 225% since January. SMCI capitalizes on its role in the ever-expanding artificial intelligence sector but also seems to have greater upside potential even as AI\u2019s top stocks lose steam. The company supplies server-sized computing solutions and counts major players like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) among its clients.\n\nFundamentally, Super Micro Computer exemplifies the idea that the most promising semiconductor and AI investment opportunities may reside with upstream suppliers \u2014 those providing \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d \u2014 rather than with end-user companies facing intense competition within the sector.\n\nThis is evident when comparing the company\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio of \u201cjust\u201d 66x against Nvidia\u2019s 97x. While not direct comparisons, this disparity suggests that, despite a 200% increase, Super Micro Computer is slightly undervalued compared to one of its major downstream clients that\u2019s captured the lion\u2019s share of wider AI exuberance.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Stocks, even fundamentally strong ones, can plunge for any number of reasons. The chances that fundamentally weak stocks plunge are much higher.\u00a0Since the value of a company\u2019s shares is directly tied to both its business model and performance, lacking this stability poses a significant financial risk.\n\nMoreover, the companies discussed in this article were once surrounded by much more optimism. As market trends shift, so too has public opinion around these companies. Today, these firms exist in former growth industries that have since seen their fortunes reverse. Others represent firms that gained fame due to the emergence of memes and meme stock mania. Regardless of their origin, investors would do well to avoid these firms.\n\nFundamental strength should be the primary determining factor when selecting investment-worthy stocks. Bearing this in mind, the firms discussed below represent some of the riskiest stocks to avoid.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nChargePoint (CHPT) Selective focus. Detail of ChargePoint commercial EV electric vehicle charging station on uncovered parking lot. CHPT stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRewind a few years and ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT)\u00a0 stock looked like it was going to be a major winner. The firm even continues to operate one of the largest charging networks in the United States. Many assumed that its strong early position would allow the company to build an unassailable lead as the electric vehicle (EV) market boomed. However, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nThe EV market continues to grow although at a stunted pace. ChargePoint, on the other hand, is contracting. Revenues declined by 24% in the fourth quarter, falling to $115.8 million. Margins concurrently fell by 3%. The combination of those two factors is overtly negative and should provide a strong enough basis for investors to avoid the stock.\n\nThe company has given guidance for positive EBITDA figures by early 2025. I strongly suspect that investors, many of whom have already been burned by EV stocks, are unwilling to move on that forecast. Furthermore, EBITDA doesn\u2019t include the effects of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization all of which contribute to overall net income. It\u2019s clear that the company does not expect profitability on a net income basis by that same time. Overall, these patterns are common among stocks to avoid owning.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestors need only take a look at the most recent earnings report of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) in\u00a0order to understand why its stock is one to avoid.\n\nThe company lost $338.1 million in net income in 2023 as sales declined by 18%. Beyond Meat can\u2019t even figure out how to profitably manufacture and sell its plant-based burgers. That\u2019s evident in the $82.7 million gross loss incurred throughout 2023. The cost of sales is simply too high. That\u2019s a particularly bad problem and compounded by the fact that product sales have also dropped.\n\nStory continues\n\nThings aren\u2019t getting better for the company either. During the fourth quarter, net loss reached $155 million. It continues to be crystal clear that Beyond Meat does not have a strong business overall despite being a prominent name in the plant-based meat industry. There is a certain irony given the fact that the forecast for that sector remains strong even in 2024. Beyond Meat got into the right opportunity at the right time but for a variety of other factors couldn\u2019t make it work.\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) stock is no longer worth touching. That isn\u2019t to say that I\u2019ve truly ever believed that it was worth touching. I haven\u2019t. I continue to scratch my head at its ascendance but remain firm in my conviction that it will ultimately fail.\n\nIn my opinion, a lot of people who still have faith in GME stock convince themselves that recent profitability matters. The truth is GameStop\u2019s earnings were lower than anticipated although positive. Revenues were more than $200 million lower than analysts had been expecting. Yet, many fans of GME stock will point to the fact that the company did provide earnings. They will use that truth to substantiate an opinion that GameStop has some sort of ability to rebound.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case because GameStop is a relic of a dying era. The company lacks the digital strategy necessary to succeed in the current gaming environment. Game downloads rule, physical disc sales do not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0the 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nAmid rising inflation and economic uncertainty, millions of young Americans are starting to invest in different asset classes to secure their future and achieve their financial goals. As of the end of 2022, a whopping 58% of US households reported owning stocks, according to the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances. Increasing household wealth and the rise of zero-commission apps like Robinhood is partially responsible for this boom in retail investing.\n\nHas there been any change in retail investing trends ever since the Fed started raising interest rates? Money-market funds, bonds, treasuries and fixed income in general became much more tempting for investors who wanted to avoid volatility that comes with stock investing. In August last year, The Wall Street Journal, citing data from Refinitiv Lipper, said in a report that in matter of just five weeks, investors pulled $11.6 billion from stock funds on a net basis, while money-market funds saw an inflow of $91.1 billion.\n\nYoung Americans are Investing in Stocks and Pre-IPO Growth Companies\n\nAnalysts also note that young Americans are increasingly getting bored of the same-old names when it comes to stocks and want to invest in companies that will grow big in the future. They want to invest in the Apples, Microsofts and Nvidias of the future. And there are interesting options available for such investors. The Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) fund, which recently went public, lets you invest in high-growth companies that aren\u2019t publicly traded. Some top names in the fund's portfolio are OpenAI, SpaceX, commercial space station company Axiom Space, Discord, Klarna, among many others. Other platforms allowing investors to invest in high-growth companies are also seeing a huge influx of young investors. For example, an April 16 Bloomberg report talked about Hiive, a platform that allows you to invest in pre-IPO, VC-backed companies. The report quoted Hiive's CEO Sim Desai, who said that the number of daily accepted bids has averaged 16 in the past 30 days, up from just three bids a year ago.\n\nRobinhood's Popularity is Increasing\n\nRobinhood is one of the popular platforms for retail investors, with over 10 million monthly active users. It's no longer an investing app where young investors band together to wage wars against short-selling hedge funds. Instead the company is in an expansion mode with new products for crypto investors as well as credit and gold cards. Last month, Bernstein started covering Robinhood stock with an Outperform rating, saying a \"monster\" crypto cycle over the next two years could boost the stock as more and more retail investors turn to the app to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024\n\nPhoto by Mohamed Hadji on Unsplash\n\nTeenagers Using Apps to Invest\n\nBeyond millennial Redditors, there's another class of retail investors entering the market: teenagers. Investing-related TikTok videos, personal finance blogs, Instagram influencers and an overall rise in financial awareness is causing teenagers in America to invest. In 2022, there were about 200,000 custodial accounts for teens at Schwab, compared to just 120,000 in 2019. That figure jumped to 300,000 in 2023.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Best Long-Term Investments for Your Child\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we used publicly available data from Robinhood that shows the most popular stocks on the investing app. We also did some manual research to see which stocks are trending on the app these days with positive sentiment. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment with these stocks where available. Some top names in the list include Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\u00a0 Why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment of stocks? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n11. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) is a new arrival in the list of popular stocks on Robinhood. The stock plummeted after Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) revealed plans to sell more shares in the coming months. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT) filed to register 146.11 million shares of common stock for holders, 21.49 million shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants, and 4.06 million warrants to purchase common stock. DJT is rebounding after these dips and the stock is up a whopping 23% over the past five days.\n\n10. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 12\n\nGameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) remains one of the favorites of retail investors who scored huge wins against hedge funds shorting the stock back in the pandemic days. GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) shares have lost about 39% so far this year. Short sellers are targeting the stock again, with GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) short interest coming in at 24% as of April 16. Are retail investors banding together yet again to beat these short sellers? Only time will tell. But for now, the stock is declining after disappointing Q4 results which saw GameStop Corp's (NYSE:GME) hardware sales tanking.\n\n9. Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:40\n\nOut of the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 40 hedge funds had stakes in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\u00a0as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The most significant stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F)\u00a0is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which had a $721 million stake in Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F).\n\nIn addition to Ford, retail investors are also buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n8. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 82\n\nRanking eighth in our list of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024 is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which has lost about 35% in value year to date. Amid growth challenges and woes in China, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has decided to cut 10% of its global workforce.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 82 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Tesla Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA). The most significant stake in Tesla Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0is owned by Philippe Laffont\u2019s Coatue Management which had a $1 billion stake in Tesla Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Tesla is a transportation company that is setting the pace for industry innovation, in our view. During the quarter, the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal third quarter earnings, where gross margins were negatively impacted by factory downtime and ramping production volumes at new manufacturing plants. However, the company noted that they remain confident by the amount of data that Tesla\u2019s established and growing fleet of vehicles has gathered, which may bode well for the company\u2019s full self-driving capabilities.\u201d\n\n7. Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 89\n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most popular stocks on Robinhood in 2024. The stock has gained about 24% so far this year. Most of these gains came after Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) won its proxy fight against Nelson Peltz who had launched an activist campaign to get board seats at Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). Like DIS, hedge funds and retail investors also like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT),\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nWalt Disney Co\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\u00a0is also one of the most popular stocks among the 933 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Our data shows that 89 hedge funds had stakes in Walt Disney Co\u00a0(NYSE:DIS)\u00a0as of the end of 2023.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and\u00a0The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).\u00a0 The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.\u201d\n\n6. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are struggling this year as the company continues to face growth challenges amid competition. In a latest blow, data shows that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has lost its market leader status in the smartphone industry to Samsung. Data from IDC shows that iPhone shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter of 2024. Samsung\u2019s market share jumped to 20.8% as of the end of the first quarter, while Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to 17.3%. IDC said rising competition in China from companies like Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, among others, is part of the reason why Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped.\n\nOrbis Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cNever before has following the crowd made so much money. Nor, in our estimation, so little sense. But just look at the opportunities the crowd has left for those of us willing to take a different view. We could wax lyrical about the glaring difference in value between Korean banks priced at 4 times earnings, versus\u00a0Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 28 times, despite diverging fundamentals\u2014Apple is increasingly at risk of bans in China, while Korean banks could double their dividends.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Dividend Stocks with Over 9% Yield According to Analysts 10 Underperforming Stocks Insiders are Buying 10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into\n\nDisclosure.None. 11 Most Popular Stocks on Robinhood in 2024was initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meme Stock Massacre: 3 Reddit Darlings on the Brink of Collapse",
        "content": "As of this writing, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) stock has been publicly trading for about a month. For a variety of reasons, the stock is down about 20%. But what may be most concerning is that volume is down sharply. It\u2019s too early to draw firm conclusions. However, the stock does not appear to have the committed following of some Reddit stocks that were a core argument for the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO).\n\nThe popularity of these \u201cmeme stocks,\u201d on subreddits such as WallStreetBets made the social media site a household name among investors. Documentaries have been made to describe the phenomenon and perhaps serve as a cautionary tale.\n\nIn fairness, meme stocks get a bad rap. There are many popular Reddit stocks that most investors would be happy to own. But this is a site for speculators, many of whom have a \u201cgo big or go home\u201d mindset that encourages risk-taking.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Reddit community is great for providing investors with support and knowledge they may not otherwise get. But the herd mentality is real. And it can blind you to some risks that are simply not worth taking. Here are three Reddit stocks that present risks that don\u2019t appear to be worth taking anymore.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is one of the original Reddit stocks to gain prominence. Investors remember it for its meteoric rise caused by an epic short squeeze in 2021. The issue for investors then, as now, is the desire to confuse an inexpensive stock with a stock having hidden value. GME stock is cheap, but does it still have value?\n\nGameStop\u2019s core business is to the gaming industry what Blockbuster video is to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). It\u2019s simply been bypassed by the proverbial better mousetrap. And the company\u2019s pivot into collectibles, while interesting, won\u2019t be a significant driver of revenue.\n\nThat leaves the company\u2019s chairman, Ryan Cohen, who has the opportunity to buy securities of other companies. That makes GameStop a hedge fund by another name. Could it work? In theory, it could. But as my InvestorPlace colleague Rich Duprey summarized recently, \u201c\u2026Profits Mean Nothing When Your Business Is Dying.\u201d Another short squeeze is improbable. The game appears to be over.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a time, Nio (NYSE:NIO) looked like it would be a rags-to-riches story. As the electric vehicle (EV) market revved up, Nio appeared to be a clear winner. But with the stock down 60% in the last 12 months, Nio faces some difficult challenges as the stock sinks back into penny stock territory.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company managed to increase deliveries in its most recent quarter. But that doesn\u2019t change the reality that the company is losing market share in its home country, China. And it was losing market share when the Chinese market was red hot. That market is cooling, and so is the company\u2019s gross margins. The general cooling in the EV market is also affecting the company\u2019s deliveries in Europe.\n\nAlso, a core piece of Nio\u2019s business model is its battery swap program. The company is committed to building 1,000 more swapping stations in 2024. That will also come at the expense of profitability.\n\nAnd if you need another reason to stay away from NIO stock, it\u2019s essential to note that short interest is up 16.5% in the last month. In a competitive market, Nio appears to be running out of juice.\n\nLyft (LYFT) lyft stock\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nLyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is part of a duopoly, such as it is, with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). The company has been increasing its revenue steadily. It\u2019s also getting closer to profitability. But being close is not the same as being profitable. And higher interest rates will hurt unprofitable companies harder.\n\nHowever, the bigger issue for Lyft, and the ride-hailing model in general, is coming from Minneapolis, Minnesota. On August 17, the city council passed an ordinance that, if passed into law, would guarantee the city\u2019s $15 minimum wage for any driver with rides originating in Minneapolis.\n\nBoth Lyft and Uber are threatening to pull out of the city if the law is passed. It\u2019s not hard to see why. The driver/gig worker remaining as an independent contractor is essential to Lyft\u2019s ability to manage its costs, particularly as it prioritizes profitability.\n\nAt this time, it\u2019s unclear if the law will pass. But it seems likely that Minneapolis won\u2019t be the only city trying to pass such laws. Investors hate uncertainty with the bluest of blue-chip companies and like it even less with an unprofitable mid-cap stock with an entrenched and profitable competitor in the sector.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

Whether it\u2019s eyeglasses, sporting goods, or beauty and cosmetics, these stores win with depth of product in their category as well as in-store expertise and guidance for shoppers who need it. E-commerce competition exists and waning retail foot traffic impacts these retailers, but the magnitude of the headwinds depends on what they sell and what extra value they provide in their stores.\n\nThe 9 specialty retail stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues missed analyst consensus estimates by 1%. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and specialty retail stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 11.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBath and Body Works (NYSE:BBWI)\n\nSpun off from L Brands in 2020, Bath & Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) is a personal care and home fragrance retailer where consumers can find specialty shower gels, scented candles for the home, and lotions.\n\nBath and Body Works reported revenues of $2.91 billion, flat year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2.6%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates but underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year.\n\nGina Boswell, CEO of Bath & Body Works, commented, \u201cThe team delivered fourth quarter net sales and earnings that exceeded the high end of our expectations. Underpinning these results was strong execution during the holiday season. Customers responded to innovation and newness as we delivered a seamless omnichannel shopping experience and drove continued enrollment in our loyalty program. Additionally, we continued to advance our operational efficiency initiatives. Looking ahead, we remain focused on further improving the customer experience and building on our strong foundation to drive long-term profitable growth.\u201d Bath and Body Works Total Revenue\n\nBath and Body Works pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group.

It was a weak quarter for the company, with a miss of analysts' revenue and earnings estimates.\n\nGameStop had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group.

It was a mixed quarter for the company, with same store sales, revenue, and gross margin exeeding expectations. On the other hand, while full year revenue guidance was roughly in line, its full-year earnings forecast was underwhelming and missed.\n\nUlta scored the fastest revenue growth and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers.

        "title": "Rate Cut Rockets: 3 Stocks to Soar When Interest Rates Fall",
        "content": "Risk-on! The stock market is widely expected to takeoff like a rocket once the U.S. Federal Reserve finally begins lowering interest rates. If that happens, investors\u2019 risk appetite is sure to increase, with certain stocks catapulting higher as a result. The last time markets got frothy in 2021, it led to record high prices for crypto, the meme stock craze, and a resurgence of public stock offerings through special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). What is likely to happen this time once interest rates decline?\n\nIf history is any guide, markets are likely to go into overdrive as the central bank eases up on its finance-tightening regime. Lower interest rates are coming. The only question is timing. With inflation proving sticky and the economy remaining strong, Wall Street has been forced to adjust its expectations for rate cuts. Future traders now expect the Fed to cut interest rates only two times this year, with the first rate cut likely to occur in September. A few weeks ago, traders saw three rate cuts with the first one happening in June.\n\nRegardless of the timing, it\u2019s never too early to prepare one\u2019s portfolio for a market surge. Here are rate cut rockets: three stocks to soar when interest rates fall.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD) hood stock: An image of a wallet with a coin in it, a cellphone on top depicting Robinhood logo. Robinhood crypto\n\nSource: salarko/Shutterstock\n\nIf markets do takeoff as interest rates are cut, then Robinhood  (NASDAQ:HOOD) will be a very good stock to own. HOOD stock has enjoyed large gains over the past year as the bulls took control of the stock market. In the past 12 months, Robinhood\u2019s share price has risen 83%, including a 48% increase so far this year. The company\u2019s stock has been flying high as trading volumes skyrocket on its app and online platform. Going forward, trading activity is likely to increase.\n\nRobinhood Markets is doing its best to make hay while the sun shines, growing the services it offers primarily to individual investors. In March, the company launched a new credit card as part of its expansion beyond a core business of online stock trading. Management says the goal is for Robinhood to morph into a financial services company and move beyond its roots as a commission-free trading firm. The Robinhood Gold Card has no annual cost or foreign-transaction fees and offers 3% cash back on all purchases. There\u2019s even a version of the credit card made of 10-karat gold.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nA riskier stock that could make a comeback if the market gets frothy again is GameStop (NYSE:GME). The troubled video game retailer thrived the last time the market peaked in 2021, becoming the signature meme stock and a favorite of the WallStreetBets crowd that tried to push GME stock \u201cto the moon.\u201d After rising more than 400% in only a few weeks, GameStop has since crashed back down to earth, currently trading 86% lower than its 2021 all-time high. But the stock could come back if the market rockets higher again.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop has been brought low in recent months by a string of disappointing earnings. The company\u2019s business model of selling video games through a chain of retail outlets now seems antiquated. GME stock fell 17% in one day after the company\u2019s last earnings print, which showed weak financial results. No forward guidance was provided. The company said that its hardware and accessories sales fell 12% year-over-year, while its software sales declined 31%. Though not ideal, investors who \u201clike the stock\u201d tend to look past the fundamentals and pile into GameStop when the market is at its most frenetic.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs interest rates fall and investors\u2019 risk appetite increases, cryptocurrencies are expected to perform well, which would benefit digital payments firm Block (NYSE:SQ). Not only is Block a financial technology (fintech) firm, it\u2019s also a major holder of crypto. As of Dec. 31, 2023, Block holds 8,038 Bitcoin (BTC-USD), which is worth $555 million at current prices. Despite being crushed during the 2022 bear market, SQ\u2019s share price has been staging a comeback and is up 11% year to date.\n\nWith its most recent earnings, Block posted a surprise profit that was mostly due to a more than $200 million gain in its Bitcoin holdings. The company also announced that it made $66 million in profit on Bitcoin sales last quarter through Cash App, a digital banking platform. That\u2019s a 90% increase from one year earlier. Block CEO Jack Dorsey remains a big proponent of crypto, going so far as to rebrand the company as \u201cBlock\u201d to reflect its increasing focus on crypto and its underlying blockchain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

        "content": "With all the turbulence in the stock market at this time, it\u2019s imperative to consider the\r\nimpact of analyst downgrades to minimize risk.\n\nFollowing a momentous AI-powered rally in the past year or so, the market\u2019s taking a breather. Moreover, with inflation coming in hot this month again, expect the stock market to shed more of its gains in the near term. Hence, with all the uncertainty, investors must consider price target cuts from Wall-Street. With that said, here are three stocks with analyst downgrades you\u2019d want to steer clear of at this time.\n\nAnalyst Downgrades: GameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nPrevious Wall-Street Rating: \u2018Sell\u2019 Current Wall-Street Rating: \u2018 Strong Sell\u2019\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is the original meme stock and continues exhibiting a downward trend. Its stock tanked more than 50% last year, with its top-line growth firmly in the red.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company posted a small profit after three loss-making quarters, but the broader issues revolve around plummeting sales. Revenues were down more than 20% in the fourth-quarter (Q4) to $1.79 billion, significantly behind analyst estimates of $2.05 billion. Some may be celebrating higher operating earnings in Q4 at $55.2 million, but this was mostly linked to the steep drop in selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A). It cut SG&A expenses by a hefty $94 million during the quarter, driven primarily by letting off employees and limiting its marketing.\n\nWith the video game retailer\u2019s sales dropping across every segment for the past several years, it\u2019s evident that GME stock is going nowhere. Belt-tightening measures are unlikely to improve the company\u2019s overall business, which continues to dwindle each quarter.\n\nLumen Technologies (LUMN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Lumen Technologies (LUMN).\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrevious Wall-Street Rating: \u2018Hold\u2019 Current Wall-Street Rating: \u2018Sell\u2019\n\nLumen Technologies (NASDAQ:LUMN) is a telecommunications business offering network services and cloud solutions, among other related offerings. Its stock took a hammering at the stock market last year, losing over 43% of its value on multiple headwinds. Revenues have been plummeting rapidly, while recent debt restructuring efforts have resulted in higher interest costs.\n\nWall-Street remains pessimistic over its long-term prospects, forecasting a substantial revenue slowdown for the next few years. A turnaround for its business hinges on its ability to reverse its negative revenue growth trend while managing its debt without further damaging its financial health.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings in Q4 included sales of roughly $3.5 billion, down substantially from $4.8 billion a year ago. Moreover, the firm lost close to $2 billion for the quarter while struggling with its massive debt load. Therefore, it\u2019s best to offload LUMN stock to minimize your downside risk.\n\nL.B.

Foster (NASDAQ:FSTR) provides construction materials and related services for industrial and infrastructure projects.\n\nLike other companies discussed in the article, it faces major challenges, including stagnating top-and-bottom-line growth and a hefty debt load.\n\nPerformances in some of its key segments, including Steel Products, have been lackluster due to strategic divestitures.\n\nIts management is looking to turn things around, though, focusing on higher-margin, higher-growth areas, but these results have yet to be convincing. Moreover, its profitability metrics are firmly in the red and have been for a long time. For instance, the average net income margin over the past five years is at a negative 0.50%. Similarly, its return on total assets over the same period is at a negative 0.86%. Additionally, analysts\u2019 earnings estimates should have been included by a considerable margin in four out of the past six quarters. Therefore, the company is up against multiple issues at this time, offering minimal upside ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Joe Biden's 'Broke Don' Nickname For Trump Looks Premature As Trump's Stake In DJT At $2.9 Billion, Barry Diller Calls DJT Buyers 'Dopes'\n\nDuring the 2020 election cycle, former President Donald Trump gave President Joe Biden the nickname \"Sleepy Joe.\" Now, as one Democratic strategist described, Biden is trying to \"out-Trump Trump\" by testing giving the former president a nickname of his own.\n\nBiden has called Trump \"Broke Don\" in an attempt to mock his mounting legal fees and relatively smaller campaign fundraising efforts to date.\n\nEven with the recent pullback in Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT), which owns social media service Truth Social, Trump's stake in the company is at $2.9 billion.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.

(NASDAQ:IAC) and Expedia Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) had harsh words for Trump Media buyers, telling CNBC that the stock is a \"scam\" and being bought by \"dopes.\"\n\nAfter dismissing Trump Media's valuation, Diller compared the stock to GameStop Corp.

According to data provider S3 Partners, new short sellers need to pay an annualized borrowing fee of 900%, requiring the stock to fall 2.5% every day just to break even.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe massive short interest comes alongside significant controversy in the stock.\n\nTwo early investors in Truth Social pled guilty to an insider trading scheme that netted them over $22 million in profits in advance of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger.\n\nTrump recently sued Truth Social's co-founders, alleging they made a \"series of reckless and wasteful decisions at a critical time\" in an attempt to take their stakes in the company, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt's still not scaring off some believers.

        "content": "Video game retailer GameStop stock (NYSE:GME) can\u2019t win for losing. Not even its first profit in four quarters could turn the tide of negative sentiment positive. The stock is down 37% in 2024 and has lost its half value over the past 12 months.\n\nThe stock sold off sharply after reporting fourth-quarter earnings late last month, wiping out all the gains made in the build up to the release. And it continues dropping in the aftermath. Now another executive is thrown out of the C-suite on his ear as executive chairman Ryan Cohen tightens his control over the video game retailer.\n\nGameStop stock is a slow motion car wreck that continues to spin out of control. It\u2019s a crash that\u2019s been going on for three straight years since its meme stock heydey, but is GME stock at the point where it\u2019s simply too cheap to ignore? Let\u2019s see.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA dwindling business\n\nThe first first thing GameStop investors need to do is rid themselves of the notion that price is value. As Warren Buffett once noted, \u201cprice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d A cheap stock price doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a valuable stock you\u2019re buying. So far, GameStop hasn\u2019t proved to the market that what it offers is worth buying. The question is, can it ever offer investors something of value?\n\nIt\u2019s a hard argument to make. Across all of its segments GameStop sales are falling and they have been for several years.\n\nSegment % Change Q42023 % Change FY2023 % Change FY2022 Hardware & Accessories (11.9%) (4.6%) (1%) Software (30.6%) (16.5%) (9.5%) Collectibles (25.4%) (21.8%) 17.0%Data source: GameStop SEC filings. Table by author.\n\nRevenue tumbled almost 20% in the fourth quarter to $1.79 billion, and was well below the $2.05 billion Wall Street anticipated. While operating earnings were higher at $55.2 million, a 19% year-over-year gain, GameStop had cut its selling, general and administrative expenses by more than 20%. The $94 million it cut from SG&A more than made up for the $9 million gain in operating profits. It was all driven by firing employees, eliminating consultant costs and limiting its marketing.\n\nGameStop is essentially hunkering down as its business spirals lower.\n\nClearing the decks\n\nThat explains why the video game retailer installed a revolving door in the executive suite. It helps get the management team out of the way. The latest to go was COO Nir Patel who joined GameStop in May 2022.\n\nIn a filing with the SEC, the retailer said Patel\u2019s separation was effective immediately and he wouldn\u2019t be replaced. His responsibilities would be assumed by other executives. Last June GameStop fired CEO Mike Furlong and opted not to replace him too. Instead. Chairman Ryan Cohen was made executive chairman and he overseas the company\u2019s day-to-day operations now.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop stock also closed down nearly 300 stores last year, ending 2023 with 4,169 locations. That helps to preserve the retailer\u2019s cash, equivalents and short-term investments that stands at $1.2 billion. It\u2019s notable and positive GameStop has little to no long-term debt, other than a low-interest, unsecured term loan stemming back to the pandemic. That at least gives the video game stock some flexibility.\n\nHow low can it go?\n\nSo it is difficult to say GameStop\u2019s stock is done falling. Although shares trade at a fraction of sales it sports a multiple hundreds of times earnings. That\u2019s not necessarily uncommon for newly profitable stocks but it indicates there is an imbalance in the equilibrium between its business and the market.\n\nWall Street has all but given up on covering the company but those that remain are not hopeful. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter recently lowered his price target to $6 per share. That\u2019s not unreasonable.\n\nWhere the bottom is is anyone\u2019s guess. I\u2019ll hazard it\u2019s somewhere north of the $1 or so it was trading at prior to the meme stock frenzy, but well below its current $11 per share level.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Meme Stocks to Sell in April Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "There are seven meme stocks to sell in April before the worst comes to worst. Meme stocks are often driven by hype and social media frenzy rather than fundamental business factors, can be incredibly volatile and unpredictable. While the potential for big gains can be enticing, the risks involved shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nThese stocks can experience sudden and dramatic price swings, fueled by the whims of retail investors rather than the company\u2019s actual performance. This makes it extremely difficult to predict when the bubble might burst, leaving investors vulnerable to significant losses.\n\nHowever, not all meme stocks are created equal; some are more risky than others. Therefore, in order for investors to protect their portfolios against volatility, i\u2019ve selected seven meme stocks to sell for this article that one should carefully consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are seven meme stocks to sell before it\u2019s too late. Don\u2019t get caught up in the hype or Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) at the expense of your portfolio.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) has been a hallmark name in the meme stock frenzy. It minted millionaires, but many more have lost money buying 0DTE calls, trying to cash in on the apparent war against the hedge funds and other institutions.\n\nGranted, there has been some impressive growth in tangible book value and levered free cash flow over the past three years, but analysts also anticipate a revenue decrease of 11.8% year over year to $1.09 billion for the first quarter ending April 2024.\n\nFurthermore, GME\u2019s current ratio and quick ratio suggest a strong liquidity position, although its return on equity and assets indicates less favorable performance compared to industry standards\u200b.\n\nThe sell thesis for GME is this: The GME bandwagon has subsided considerably, as I believe that the reality of GME\u2019s continually shrinking main line of business is starting to hit home for many.\n\nGME\u2019s 30-day historical volatility has steadily decreased since its peak in 2021, which suggests a diminished risk appetite among retail investors who once pumped its high flucuations.\n\nFurthermore, GME\u2019s 30-day implied volatility peaked this year near the start of March, reaching levels unseen for many years.\n\nIt should be noted that during this spike of implied volatility, an influx of put options were purchased as well, with open interest reaching 0.93 on the put-call ratio.\n\nIn my view, it\u2019s hard to classify GME as having meme investors\u2019 backing when historical and especially implied volatility has been declining to a significant degree and consistently over time. If the options market (which includes bears) is pricing in lower future volatility over time, then it suggests a stabilization in expectations from both bulls and bears. This stabilization implies that the market forsees fewer extreme swings in GME\u2019s price, aligning more with fundamental trading than speculative bursts via social media trends or coordinated buying, which defines meme stock investing in the first place.\n\nStory continues\n\nI don\u2019t see a way forward for GME, so it\u2019s then one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) experienced a notable decline from its peak stock price, facing challenges in ramping up production and maintaining investor enthusiasm.\n\nRIVN projected a production target of 57,000 vehicles for 2024, following its performance in the first quarter where it produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588. The company also reported a net loss of $5,432 million, an improvement from the previous year\u2019s $6,752 million. Its gross profit also saw improvement, with a loss of $2,030 million in 2023 compared to a loss of $3,123 million in 2022.\n\nHowever, despite these improvements, in the same year, it had capital expenditures of $1,026 million, and ongoing need for substantial investment to scale production capabilities and develop new models.\n\nI feel that the need for additional capital is a serious risk, as it could lead to share dilution for investors or substantially add to its financial risk via debt financing, which makes it one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) In this photo illustration the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) is a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company that\u2019s seen significant interest from investors due to the cryptocurrency market\u2019s volatility and the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will occur in under two weeks at the time of writing.\n\nI don\u2019t generally suggest that investors should buy Bitcoin mining company stocks as they are risky investments. As the blockchain reward halves for Bitcoin, companies like MARA are under increasing pressure to maintain their margins, which then puts pressure on Bitcoin to increase in price to maintain stability.\n\nAnalysts project a final loss in 2023 with positive profits of $61 million expected in 2024, underpinned by an estimated average annual growth rate of 119%.\n\nThe company specific-risk for MARA is that its strongly-invested in the Bitcoin mining industry and lacks diversification into other operating segments. It has one of the strongest hash rates in the industry at 24.7 in 2023, making it overly concentrated compared to its peers.\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO), a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, has faced corrections due to concerns over its operating losses and the sustainability of its vehicle delivery growth\u200b.\n\nAnalysts highlight concerns over declining electric vehicle deliveries and market share in China, pointing towards a challenging outlook for NIO. Furthermore, the company\u2019s Q4 results showed margin contraction and widening losses, indicating the hurdles it faces in maintaining its growth trajectory and achieving profitability.\n\nNIO is a meme stock that has also lost its appeal as the one to watch for the weak, and further risks of capital depreciation I feel are very real. It has already lost 47.96% of its value over the past year, and it seems likely that it will drop further due to the structural weaknesses in China and its shaky fundamentals. I therefore recommend that investors steer clear of NIO, and also designate it as one of those meme stocks to sell.\n\nPolestar Automotive (PSNY) A Polestar (PSNY) sign at the area at Polestar powerstop in Mj\u00f6lby.\n\nSource: Jeppe Gustafsson / Shutterstock.com\n\nPolestar Automotive (NASDAQ:PSNY) has drawn attention in the electric vehicle space but faces challenges in maintaining its stock value. Highlighting this, its share has dropped 83.09% in value over the past five years.\n\nPSNY recently secured $950 million in external funding, which marks a new phase for the company. This is expected to be more significant in the second half of the year as their SUVs reach full production and distribution.\n\nHowever, some cracks in the thesis start to appear when one examines PSNY\u2019s financials. For instance, it has almost three times as much debt as cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, and had a negative cash flow of $1.8 billion over the past twelve months. More funding is needed for it to continue its operations, and this could very well come as a mix of both an equity raise and a raise through additional debt, which puts even more stress on the company.\n\nLyft (LYFT) The Lyft (LYFT) logo on the side of a pink car parked on a street.\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nLyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is adapting to a post-pandemic world, focusing on profitability. However, it remains to be seen if these efforts can sustain its meme stock status\u200b.\n\nThe company has had negative accounting profits over the last twelve months. However, in the future, it\u2019s expected to reach profitability, but this comes at a steep price. Its forward P/E ratio is 35 times earnings, which is much higher than the median of its peer companies that also operate in the ride hailing market.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, LYFT anticipates gross bookings of approximately $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion for Q1\u201924, with an Adjusted EBITDA of $50 million to $55 million. The full year\u2019s directional guidance suggests mid-teen year-over-year growth in rides.\n\nHowever, this does not change the fact that its shares could still be perceived as overvalued, especially when one considers that it\u2019s revenue is only expected to climb 12.33% next year and is already at 5.23 billion at the time of writing. It hasn\u2019t managed to grow its bottom line despite its robust revenue growth, and I\u2019m doubtful this will change in the foreseeable future.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) Mobile phone with logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC). Pumping stock exchange prices by Reddit investors. Playing on market, manipulation. Losses, crisis.\n\nSource: Ira Lichi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) became synonymous with meme stock rallies during the pandemic. Those days are long over, and traders looking to pump enthusiasm into this stock will end up getting burned sooner or later.\n\nFor 2024, AMC is expected to see a revenue increase, going from $4.55 billion in 2023 to a projected $5.26 billion. This optimistic revenue forecast suggests a rebound, including a forecasted increase in EPS from -1.63 to -0.81, indicating an improvement in losses. Analyst consensus on AMC\u2019s stock leans towards a \u201cSell\u201d rating, and I think this should not be taken lightly.\n\nAMC\u2019s issues are the same as GME\u2019s; futile attempts at pivoting to a world and consumer preferences that no longer support its core business model. This kind of pessimism is well-deserved given its lack of a constructive track record, and is therefore one of those meme stocks to sell as well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Zombie Stock Apocalypse: 7 Walking Dead Companies to Avoid",
        "content": "An underappreciated part of investing is knowing when to cut your losses. No one bats a thousand in this field; even the best investors make some bad picks and come up with ideas that don\u2019t pan out from time to time.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to get a pick wrong. It\u2019s quite another thing to stay wrong. Further to that, there\u2019s no reason to be loyal to a stock just because you already own it. In fact, investors should pay special attention to make sure they don\u2019t fall prey to sunk cost fallacy.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to dump a bad investment and reallocate the funds to a more promising opportunity. These are seven struggling stocks to avoid; investors should dump these companies now before things go from bad to worse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) was one of the most improbable stock market events of the past decade. Shares rose as much as 100-fold from the lows during its historic short squeeze. The event became so famous that a documentary was made about it. Several hedge funds lost large sums of money betting against the company, further adding to the drama.\n\nStripped of the magic, however, there is a little to recommend GameStop as an investment in the year 2024.\n\nThe company continues to post poor operating results. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising as more and more of the gaming industry goes to digital rather than physical distribution means. GameStop\u2019s other efforts such as selling collectibles and its prior cell phone venture also failed to turn around the firm\u2019s prospects. The future looks especially bleak as game developers increasingly stop selling games on physical discs altogether.\n\nGameStop shares have slumped in 2024 is it becomes increasingly clear that there will be no comeback for the firm\u2019s operating business. Traders should exit their GameStop shares before they lose what\u2019s left of the remaining value.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf GameStop was the original meme stock, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was not far behind. Traders piled into AMC shares back in 2021 in hopes of turning around the struggling movie theater chain. Advocates hoped to set off what they called the mother of all short squeezes.\n\nAnd credit where it\u2019s due, a huge short squeeze did occur. AMC rose from a (split-adjusted) low of $10 up to nearly $400 at its ultimate peak. But that period has long since passed, and shares are now down 99% from the highs.\n\nAMC leadership was not able to capitalize on the hype and interest around the company. The management team has made questionable decisions, such as investing in a gold mining company which had no apparent connection to AMC\u2019s core movie business.\n\nStory continues\n\nBox office attendance remains down versus pre-pandemic levels. And AMC doesn\u2019t have much time to turn things around. AMC\u2019s balance sheet is troubled, with the firm having a sharply negative book value per share. This indicates that the stock would be effectively worthless if the company wound down operations today.\n\nGiven its huge debt load and poor operating results, AMC seems likely to continue sinking further into penny stock territory.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) spce stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBack during the 2021 SPAC boom, traders were willing to give almost anything a shot. Even some frankly out of this world ideas. That includes Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE).\n\nRichard Branson\u2019s company seeks to popularize a form of space tourism. We\u2019re not talking about going to Mars here, but rather reaching orbit just long enough to enjoy a brief zero gravity flight experience.\n\nIn theory, there may be demand for this sort of trip although short sellers have suggested otherwise. They claim the marketing and hype went well ahead of what potential customers could reasonably expect to receive on a Virgin Galactic voyage.\n\nIn any case, years after the business has tried to reach commercial stage, things are still not up and running to a meaningful degree. The company generated just $6.8 million of revenue in 2023. Analysts actually forecast that top-line number dropping to an even lower figure in 2024 and 2025.\n\nWithout any meaningful volume of revenue-paying customers, Virgin Galactic stock seems like it\u2019s going to get stuck on the launchpad.\n\nfuboTV (FUBO) FuboTV (FUBO) logo on iPhone display\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nfuboTV (NYSE:FUBO) is a streaming video business centered around live sports content. The idea is that a customer can subscribe to fuboTV and keep up with all their favorite sporting events in one place rather than having to deal with the hassle of various streaming subscription services.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s demand for product. Indeed, the company generated more than $1.3 billion of revenue last year, though competition is a concern. Rather, the big issue is that fuboTV has not found a path to profitability.\n\nThe company has to pay high prices for the licensing rights to those sporting events. It\u2019s such a problem that fuboTV has historically struggled to even generate a positive gross margin. That is to say fuboTV ends up paying almost as much to the sports events rightsholders as it brings in from subscribers, leaving virtually no profit whatsoever even before accounting for other business expenses.\n\nThere had been hopes that fuboTV could try to find other paths to monetization such as a live sports betting application. But these efforts have largely fizzled out. fuboTV still has a nearly half a billion dollar market cap. This seems excessive given the companies large and persistent operating losses and shaky balance sheet.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nQuite a few years ago, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) was a popular stock with traders. The company was one of the first to market with plant-based protein products. These appeared to be rapidly gaining appeal with health focused consumers.\n\nHowever, the landscape has dramatically changed over the past few years. Key partnerships with fast food restaurants failed to deliver the anticipated unit growth that Beyond Meat\u2019s investors had been banking on. In fact, plant protein products have lost so much steam that some formerly vegan restaurants are putting animal meat back on the menu.\n\nMeanwhile Beyond Meat\u2019s sales at grocery stores have slowed down amid rising competition. There are other plant-based food start-ups and also large package food companies such as Kellanova\u2019s (NYSE:K) Incogmeato product line which are pressuring Beyond Meat.\n\nBeyond Meat has struggled to generate positive gross margin on their products. This means it\u2019s costing them nearly as much simply to manufacture their plant-based food products as they resell for. After overhead, interest, taxes, and other such expenses Beyond Meat runs massive losses.\n\nThe company has a dramatically negative book value which implies that there is very little residual value for shareholders. With revenues slumping, and the company in debt and running large losses, BYND stock seems set to leave its investors with indigestion.\n\nOatly (OTLY) OTLY stock: Image of oat milk on a tray.\n\nSource: Katrinshine / Shutterstock.com\n\nOatly (NASDAQ:OTLY) is another alternative food company that finds itself in deep trouble.\n\nThe company rose the prominence thanks to its oat milk product which serves as an alternative to cow\u2019s milk.\n\nInvestors hoped that Oatly\u2019s partnerships with cafes and coffee shops could help give the brand a boost and drive consumer adoption more broadly. Unfortunately for Oatly, there\u2019s little evidence that the company has been able to become a powerful consumer brand.\n\nThe truth is that it hasn\u2019t been difficult for other producers to make their own versions or store brands of oat milk. Additionally, oat milk as a category hardly has a monopoly on the alternative dairy product space. There\u2019s soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, and it seems new types of\u00a0milk products arise almost every year.\n\nAs such, Oatly increasingly looks like a one trick pony whose trick wasn\u2019t that compelling. The company lost more than $400 million last year and analysts expect further large losses in 2024 and 2025. Given the company\u2019s poor balance sheet, it seems only a matter of time until Oatly runs into a liquidity squeeze.\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) movie playing during flight\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) is a discount airline focused on budget travelers. Instead of operating a traditional hub-and-spoke system, Spirit focuses on having a more specialized route network. It prioritizes routes which appeal to leisure travelers with ultra-low fares.\n\nLast year a rival airline, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), announced its intention to acquire Spirit. This caused SAVE shares to rally.\n\nHowever, the Department of Justice eventually blocked the merger on antitrust grounds, suggesting consumers would be harmed if the airlines merged.\n\nUnfortunately for Spirit, it finds itself in a weak position as an independent airline. The airline has been losing money, and it currently has significant capacity constraints due to engine defects that grounded a chunk of its fleet. In addition, the surging oil price will cause Spirit problems with jet fuel costs going forward.\n\nSome traders have rallied around Spirit Airlines, led by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. These traders are hoping to turn Spirit into a meme stock.\n\nGiven the difficulties of the airline industry and Spirit\u2019s poor competitive positioning, however, traders should seek to get off this plane before it runs into further turbulence.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "People will always need to borrow money. They will also want to discover opportunities to save money and grow their capital through investments. The financial sector offers these opportunities for consumers.\n\nSome corporations in the fintech industry have become stable cash flow producers. Others are high-growth corporations that have recently become profitable and are rapidly increasing their profit margins. There is a steady demand in the industry, which means investors will find plenty of opportunities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some opportunities in the finance sector, these are some of the top fintech stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntuit (INTU) Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is the corporation behind popular products like Quickbooks, Turbotax and CreditKarma. The company\u2019s software comes in handy when you have to pay taxes and get your finances in order.\n\nThe fintech giant has a $177 billion market cap and a 65x P/E ratio. The corporation offers a 0.57% dividend yield which is low, but the dividend growth rate has been captivating. Intuit recently hiked its quarterly dividend from 78 cents to 90 cents. That\u2019s a 15.4% year-over-year increase.\n\nRising net income will help the company sustain a double-digit dividend growth rate for many years. The company more than doubled its net income in\u00a0Q2 FY24,\u00a0while revenue grew by 11% year-over-year.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue increased by 18% year-over-year. That\u2019s a notable development since this segment is Intuit\u2019s largest component. More growth in this area will translate into elevated revenue growth throughout the company.\n\nIntuit is aiming for 11% to 12% year-over-year revenue growth for full fiscal 2024. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to reach $9.37 to $9.67 which indicates 11% to 15% year-over-year growth.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) Robinhood (HOOD) app and logo on screen. Robinhood financial services company. The company offers mobile app and website that offers people the ability to invest in stocks\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) didn\u2019t do itself any favors during the GameStop (NYSE:GME) fiasco, but the fintech corporation looks very promising with the bad press far behind it. Robinhood offers a suite of financial products that is hard to beat. The company\u2019s offers are bound to attract new users and keep existing members more active.\n\nRobinhood is offering a credit card with\u00a03% cashback across the board. Most credit card issuers only offer that amount of cash back for a single category. You also have the opportunity to open an IRA with Robinhood and receive a 3% match on your contributions. While you need a Robinhood Gold account to access these features, the cashback and matches easily pay for the membership fee.\n\nThe fintech company isn\u2019t just a trading app that relies on investors\u2019 sentiment on cryptocurrencies to perform well anymore. The company is innovating beyond stock investing and might pressure other fintech companies to follow suit with their credit card cash back rewards and IRA matches.\n\nThe valuation may not be the best, but long-term investors can wait it out.\u00a0Q4 2023 revenue increased by 24% year-over-year, while net income became positive to the tune of $30 million. The company is competitive in the financial industry and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Robinhood announced another game-changing product by the end of the year.\n\nMastercard (MA) A close-up shot of Mastercard credit or debit cards.\n\nSource: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) has generated solid returns for shareholders. The stock is up by 33% over the past year and has gained 104% over the past five years. Shares trade at a 41x P/E ratio and offer a 0.55% dividend yield. Mastercard makes up for the low yield with a high dividend growth rate. This fintech corporation hiked its quarterly dividend from 57 cents per share to 66 cents per share in 2024. That\u2019s a 15.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nThe credit and debit card leader reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year net income growth in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Profit margins came to 42.6% for the quarter.\n\nPeople will continue to use their credit cards to buy products and services. Even when people scale back on purchases or one fad replaces another, consumers will continue to use their Mastercard credit and debit cards. The fintech giant makes a small percentage of every transaction and those purchases add up. Shareholders have been rewarded nicely over the long run, which means Mastercard seems poised to deliver more gains for its investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The stock market rang the doorbell of the New Year with a bang during the 1st quarter. The S&P 500 index built on last year's +24% gain with another +10% advance during the first three months of the year. And as a result of these increases, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index is knocking on the door of the 40,000 milestone more specifically, the Dow closed the month at 39,807 (see chart below). To put his into context, when I was born more than 50 years ago, the Dow was valued at less than 1,000 not a bad run. This is proof positive of what Einstein called the 8th Wonder of the World, compounding. At Sidoxia Capital Management, we view investing as a marathon, not a sprint. You cannot realize the benefits of compounding without having a long-term time horizon. The sooner you start saving and the more you save, the faster and larger your retirement nest egg will grow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with DJT. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nIf you are one of the people who thinks the stock market is too high, then you should definitely ignore Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), arguably the greatest investor of all-time. Buffett predicted the Dow will reach an astronomical level of one million (1,000,000) within the next 100 years. I'm not sure I will still be around to witness this momentous achievement, however, if history repeats itself, this targeted timeframe could prove conservative.\n\nDespite the magnitude and duration of this bull market, there is still a lot of angst and anxiety over the upcoming election. Nevertheless, investors are choosing instead to focus on the strong fundamentals of the economy. Just this last week, we saw the broadest measurement of economic activity, GDP (Gross Domestic Product), get revised higher to +3.4% growth during the 4th quarter of 2023 (see chart below). On the jobs front, the unemployment picture remains healthy (3.9%), near a generational low. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nSource: Trading Economics and Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd when it comes to the all-important inflation data, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, Core PCE index (Core Personal Consumption Expenditures), was also just released in-line with economists' projections at 2.5% (see chart below), very near the Fed's long-term 2.0% inflation target and well below the Core PCE's recent peak near 6%. Dow Knocking on the Door of 40,000\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal and Commerce Department\n\nThis resilient economic data, when combined with the declining inflation figures, has resulted in the Federal Reserve sticking with its plan of cutting its Federal Funds interest rate target three times this year. If inflation reverses course or remains stubbornly high, then there is a higher likelihood that interest rate cuts will be delayed. On the flip side, if economic data slows significantly or the country goes into a recession, then the probability of sooner and/or more Fed interest-rate cuts will increase.\n\nIn other news, here are some of the other major financial headlines this month:\n\nFrancis Scott Key Baltimore Bridge Collapse: Six people died when a large container ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge in the Port of Baltimore. An estimated 50 million tons of goods valued at $80 billion flows through this port, making this one of the top 10 ports in the country. The auto and coal industry supply chains will be disproportionately affected, but the good news is much of these goods will be diverted to other larger ports (e.g., Port of New York and Port of New Jersey). DJT Debut: A lot of hype surrounded the trading debut of Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), which began trading last week under the initials of our country's former president, Donald J. Trump (Ticker: DJT). Despite only posting a few million in revenue and -$50 million in losses during the first nine months of 2023, the stock skyrocketed +65% in its first week of trading and attained a $9 billion valuation. Time will tell if Trump's Truth Social media platform will gain traction and justify the stock's price, or rather suffer the declining fate of other meme stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) or AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC). SBF Sentenced to 25 Years: The former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange company FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was sentenced to 25 years in prison due to his conviction on seven counts of fraud and what is believed to be $8 billion in stolen client funds. SBF didn't help his own cause by perjuring himself, tampering with witnesses, and showing a lack of remorse, according to the judge.\n\nWe are only 25% of the way through the year, but the Dow is knocking on the 40,000-milestone door. The way things look now, investors are wiping their feet on the welcome doormat and ready to walk right in.\n\nThis article is an excerpt from a previously released Sidoxia Capital Management complimentary newsletter (April 1, 2024).

        "title": "3 Stocks With the Highest Short Interest Headed Into April",
        "content": "Investors looking at stocks with the highest short interest in April tend to target two possible plays: ride the short-selling wave in hopes the stock is further suppressed or hang onto the hope of a short squeeze sending shares soaring. While short squeezes happen, they\u2019re uncommon and rarely gather the momentum to hit absurd highs that many expect. Short squeezes like we saw with GameStop (NYSE:GME) are an exception rather than the rule and tend to be one of those events that happen once or twice during an investor\u2019s market lifecycle.\n\nDon\u2019t hang your hat on the hopes of a short squeeze for these stocks with the highest short interest in April. Each has specific factors driving short interest; in each case, those variables are well-established and point to further trouble.\n\nSunPower (SPWR) a phone with the sunpower logo in front of a U.S. flag\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nClocking in at a whopping 83% short interest, SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) is the most-shorted stock as we enter April. The residential rooftop solar sector is notoriously difficult to penetrate, with tons of high-quality companies competing for an increasingly shrinking pool of interested homeowners. At the same time, high upfront and financing costs are cutting into sales across the industry. Both factors are pushing SunPower\u2019s stock down and, staking claim to less than 1.5% of the total existing market, SunPower has a long way to catch up to top competitors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA major sticking point for SunPower is its limited unique or proprietary offerings. In a sector as flooded with competitors as residential rooftop solar, companies live and die by their differentiated offerings. While SunPower\u2019s SunVault energy storage system is proprietary, it competes with a range of companies with unique hardware fully integrated into the value chain, like Enphase Energy\u2019s (NASDAQ:ENPH) microinverters. While SunPower may not be a \u201cbad\u201d stock, its lack of profitability and limited competitive advantage set it up as the stock with the highest short interest in April.\n\nStory continues\n\nB. Riley Financial (RILY) a magnifying glass enlarges the B. Riley (RILY) logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnagging another top spot on the list of stocks with the highest short interest in April is struggling financial services firm B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY), with 76% short interest. The aggressive short interest comes from management\u2019s failure to file audited financial results last month. Financial chicanery may be part and parcel of many company reports, but failing to file is a big deal that could cover major financial misdeeds or mismanagement \u2014 but only time will tell. B. Riley got another extension to file, with a new deadline of April 19th, which pushed shares about 26% higher but only served to reinvigorate short interest as short sellers anticipate either further delays (or worse).\n\nBeyond this already potentially devastating development, B. Riley\u2019s financial stats justify its high short interest. The company\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio sits at a whopping 5.64. Though financial service firms tend to carry substantial debt, as leveraged investment positions count toward the total, the wider industry\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio is nearly one-fifth of B. Rile. It sits at an average of just 1.42. Worse yet, the company\u2019s net margin is -5.38%, compared to the sector\u2019s 12.24%, and nearly every other measure of financial health is equally concerning.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American meat substitute company Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is a perennially shorted stock with high short interest; April\u2019s short interest count is 36%. The many reasons for Beyond\u2019s high short interest are clear \u2014 even during panicked shopping sprees, consumers studiously avoided buying Beyond Meat products, reinforcing the fake meat\u2019s total lack of consumer popularity.\n\nTo that end, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 filings say it all. Sales slumped for the quarter and year, at 7% and 18% dips, respectively. Worse yet, profits dropped even as 2022\u2019s shaky economy, as its quarterly net loss more than doubled in 2023\u2019s fourth quarter to hit $155 million. There\u2019s little upside for this struggling stock, justifying its high short interest and ultimately putting the company at risk of dissolution. Though some see potential in Beyond Meat as a short-squeeze play, the verdict is in on the fake meat stock \u2014 and it\u2019s rotten.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Back when interest rates were low and speculative fervor ran high, video-game retailer\u00a0GameStop (NYSE:GME) was a darling among meme-stock traders. Those days are gone, however, and the hope of a full recovery for GameStop stock\u00a0is fading fast. Frankly, it\u2019s \u201cgame over\u201d for GameStop\u2019s investors in 2024.\n\nGameStop is a relic from the era of physical console games. Video game enthusiasts now usually buy digital game downloads or streams. GameStop could face the same fate as Blockbuster Video. I encourage you to invest your capital in a more promising business.\n\nWhy Did GameStop Stock Drop 15% in a Single Day?\n\nGameStop stock dropped 15% on March 27, and that didn\u2019t just happen by chance. The previous day, GameStop\u00a0published its fourth-quarter 2023 financial results, but we\u2019ll get to that topic in a moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlong with that, GameStop disclosed that the company had recently eliminateda number of jobs, an unspecified number of jobs, actually. It\u2019s probably not a good sign that GameStop\u00a0opted not to reveal how deep the jobs cuts were.\n\nAlong with fewer employment roles, GameStop also has fewer store locations. GameStop\u00a0had 4,413 stores in January 2023, but that number dwindled to 4,169 stores as of Feb. 3, 2024.\n\nIt looks like GameStop, once the meme king, is shrinking. The company\u2019s sales are shrinking, too, so let\u2019s delve into the unfortunate details right now.\n\nGameStop\u2019s Revenues Aren\u2019t Likely to Rebound\n\nAs I explained earlier, GameStop is having problems because today\u2019s gamers typically download their games digitally. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter succinctly summarized the issue.\n\n\u201cAn increasing mix of digital downloads is hurting physical retail, and there is simply no reason to go to the store if a consumer can just order a game and download it immediately,\u201d Pachter wrote.\n\nConsequently, GameStop\u2019s net sales declined from $2.226 billion in 2022\u2019s fourth quarter to $1.794 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Pachter seems pessimistic, as he believes that GameStop\u2019s revenues \u201care highly unlikely to rebound unless management figures out a way to drive store traffic.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts expected GameStop to report Q4 2023 net sales of $2.05 billion. Thus, GameStop missed Wall Street\u2019s consensus forecast. The company also missed on the bottom line, as analysts predicted GameStop would post adjusted earnings of 30 cents per share; the actual result turned out to be 22 cents per share.\n\nGameStop Stock: Forget About This Former Meme King\n\nThe bottom line is, don\u2019t expect GME\u00a0stock to stage a miraculous full recovery. The company sells products that aren\u2019t popular with gamers in 2024, and GameStop isn\u2019t the meme king anymore.\n\nInvesting in GameStop\u00a0now is like trying to rewind the clock or turn back the calendar. Look toward the future of gaming and not the past. If you value your wealth, just stay away from GameStop stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meme stocks are making a resurgence as the broader stock market ends the first quarter on a strong note.\n\nThough the meme stock frenzy hasn't quite reached the same intensity as it did in 2021, when GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) stocks catapulted to new heights, the meme phenomenon has continued in a concentrated handful of standouts.\n\nIn recent trading, for example, there\u2019s been an uptick in interest in GameStop (GME) sparked in part by new additions to the market via IPO, such as Reddit (RDDT) and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT).\n\nReddit stock soared over 90% to more than $65 a share in its first three days of trading, well above its IPO price of $34 a share. Shares of the social network platform have continued to experience volatility, however, falling to around $49 as of Thursday's close.\n\nAnd after initially rising by as much as 50% on its first day of trading, Trump Media also saw a decrease in value later in the week, as the stock closed Thursday's session around $62 per share.\n\n\"It's been momentum all along since November, but the leading momentum stocks have generally been stocks that have been delivering the goods,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) about the broader market rally. \"We're starting to see people chase stocks just simply because they're going up, not because of any fundamental reason. That, to me, indicates froth.\"\n\nAnnex Wealth Management's Brian Jacobsen told Yahoo Finance Live that investor interest in meme stocks could be tied directly to FOMO mentality, or a fear of missing out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to find the next hot thing, and they\u2019re just beginning to chase it and pile into it,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cThat obviously can work well, but it can also then end in tears, especially if you don\u2019t get into those names early enough.\u201d\n\n3 hallmarks of meme stocks\n\nBut what is a meme stock, exactly?\n\nSosnick explained that there are three main criteria for evaluating if a stock belongs to the category.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe first indicator of a meme stock is a \"quasi-religious fervor,\" according to Sosnick.\n\n\"It's one thing to be enthusiastic about a stock, it's another thing to just be so hyped up about it,\" Sosnick said. \"Think about how the real apes were in AMC, the real devotees in GameStop early on. Certainly, one can say that about the former president's base, who I think helped getting DJT's stock moving.\"\n\nThe second criterion is a disregard for fundamentals. Traditionally, investors look for opportunities that offer a financial return over a long-term time horizon, especially one that can beat the market's performance over that same time period.\n\nOn the other hand, many meme stock investors have a much shorter time horizon in mind as they look to quickly flip speculative assets if the price spikes to turn a hefty profit.\n\n\"If you're believing in the faith of a stock, if you have a non-analytical view of the stock, well, then you could disregard the fundamentals,\" Sosnick added, noting that stocks trading on momentum can seem expensive \"by any conventional metrics.\" The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) prepares for Reddit's initial public offering on March 21, 2024, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nLastly, Sosnick said investors should watch for high short interest.\n\nShort interest refers to bets made by investors that a stock's price will fall rather than rise. In the case of DJT, the high short interest was precedented but still in a high range of 11%. The average short interest for public companies is typically between 3% and 4% but can reach as high as 40% when investors are more pessimistic.\n\nEssentially, according to Sosnick\u2019s definition, meme stocks utilize an intense passion from retail investors who are willing to take on more risk and ignore some of the more conventional investing strategies for a chance at higher returns, especially in the short term.\n\nPublic COO Stephen Sikes largely agreed, though he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that simple. Sikes claimed that meme stocks are attractive to a wide variety of investors with different goals and strategies, not just those looking to flip them for an immediate return.\n\n\u201cWe have some investors that are long-term buy-and-hold investors, and we have some that are traders trying to take advantage of volatility and momentum in the market,\u201d Sikes said. \u201cThey see an opportunity here more so than sort of the quasi-religious fervor you might have seen in prior eras.\u201d\n\nAs for why meme stocks are back in the picture, Sikes told Yahoo Finance that a combination of investors\u2019 familiarity with a company\u2019s products or brand and increased market volatility is likely to blame.\n\nAnd when asked where investors may be able to find the next targets of \u201cmeme mania,\u201d Jacobsen noted the market may shift toward the small-cap space and underperforming sectors such as industrials, manufacturing, and utilities.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Trump Social\u2019s public debut puts \u2018all other meme stocks to shame,\u2019 veteran analyst says",
        "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, went public this week. The parent company of Trump\u2019s social media platform, Truth Social, trades under the ticker symbol DJT (also the former president's initials); Wall Street gives it a market valuation of nearly $8 billion. As of Wednesday, the stock traded at roughly $66 per share.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in almost 30 years that one of Trump\u2019s business enterprises has gone public\u2014and Bloomberg estimates it boosted Trump\u2019s net value by $4 billion. Surprisingly enough, this also sends him into the ranks of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the first time. Observers have also questioned whether Trump will use this extra wealth to cover a $175 million bond he owes on a civil court judgment, but analysts aren\u2019t optimistic about DJT\u2019s future.\n\nAnalysts warn DJT\u2019s performance won\u2019t match its clout by a long shot. Indeed, Michael Pachter, a managing director of equity research at wealth management firm Wedbush, called DJT a meme stock that \u201cputs all other meme stocks to shame.\u201d\n\nPachter, who\u2019s been providing entertainment coverage for the past 20 years, says there are several red flags about the company, including its high valuation in relation to its low revenue, lack of earnings, and limited appeal to users, that suggest the stock will be a flop.\n\nWhy DJT could be the next meme stock\n\nDJT\u2019s public launch has been a long time coming. A successful but rocky merger between Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, and Digital World Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company, finally brought many years of civil and criminal lawsuits, closing extensions, and vote postponements to an end. Although DJT was able to finally get off the ground, Pachter doesn\u2019t have high hopes for the stock\u2019s future performance, predicting it\u2019s doomed like other meme stocks including GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond.\n\nPachter defines a meme stock as one \u201cwhere the valuation is completely dissociated from its underlying fundamentals,\u201d and whose popularity is driven by \u201ca herd of retail investors who share their views on message boards, rather than by a group of thoughtful and rational institutional investors.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOther meme stocks, such as GameStop, soared during the pandemic-era retail investor bump because investors piled in \u201cregardless of fundamentals in order to capitalize on the mismatch of expectations,\u201d Pachter says. GameStop\u2019s stock, which closed at over $340 per share at its pandemic-era peak in January 2021 since crashed, GameStop stocks closed at just $50 the following month.\n\nSell ratings, market caps, and valuations of other meme stocks demonstrate how unstable Trump\u2019s media company is, Pachter says. Wedbush has a sell rating on GameStop and a $5.60 price target, he said. Its stock is trading at $13; its market cap is around $4 billion, and it has sales of around $5 billion, \u201cso the valuation isn\u2019t that outrageous.\u201d\n\nTrump Social, on the other hand, has a valuation between $6 billion and $7 billion, but only brings in revenues of around $5 million. \u201cIt trades at over 1,000 times [its] revenue, where GameStop trades at less than one times its revenue,\" Pachter notes.\n\nThe truth about Truth Social\n\nWhen DJT went public this week, so did its social media platform Truth Social. While the high trading price might make investors think the platform is successful, it brought in only $3.4 million in revenue for the first nine months of 2023 and lost around $49 million, according to Axios.\n\nFor context, Trump is the only president to ever create a social media platform, which he launched in 2022 after being banned from major social platforms including Facebook and X in the aftermath of the Jan. 6. attack on the U.S Capitol. His actions of using the platform to organize an armed insurrection to storm the Capitol building as Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 election, \u201cconstituted a severe violation\u201d of Meta\u2019s rules, according to the social media company. His accounts on both platforms have since been reinstated. While Trump made history by making his own social media platform, so far, it hasn\u2019t taken off like other popular apps.\n\nNot only is Truth Social struggling to make money, but it\u2019s also struggling to gain users.\n\nThe social media platform has fewer users and less income than any social network that has gone public before\u2013and its user base, mostly MAGA supporters, doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone. Indeed, according to a 2022 Pew Research Center study that examined 200 prominent accounts on the platform, about half the Truth Social accounts had references to being right-leaning or pro-Trump in their profile\u2013higher than any other alternative social media site.\n\nTruth Social\u2019s user turnout is underperforming several other social media platforms. Truth Social doesn\u2019t release official user numbers, which is unusual for a public company. But according to estimates, there are about 5 million monthly visits to the site. By comparison, X (formerly Twitter) has about 550 million monthly users while Snapchat has about 800 million monthly users.\n\nWhile none of them are \u201cparticularly profitable,\u201d Pachter says, \u201cat least they have a user base that can justify\u201d high stock prices and big investor interest. To justify its high valuation, he thinks Truth Social would need at least 200 million users. Since its current user base heavily overlaps with Trump supporters, the platform will have trouble gaining a larger following.\n\n\u201cTruth Social has not attracted users outside of MAGA world,\u201d Pachter says. Other social media platforms, like Snapchat, are \u201cappealing to virtually anyone under 30, so it has a potential audience of 2 to 3 billion.\u201d The maximum addressable market for Truth Social, he estimates, is just about \u201c75 million people who like Trump.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Trump Media, Reddit surge despite questionable profit prospects, taking on the 'meme stock' mantle",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Reddit and Trump Media are the first notable social media companies to begin trading publicly in the last five years. They're also, thanks to the rabid reception among investors coupled with the companies' fuzzy profit outlooks, the latest meme stocks.\n\nMeme stocks are typically shares in companies whose underlying business fails to justify a surge in their price. The action is often driven by small investors who for some reason pile into a stock, be it belief that a struggling company can turn itself around, a disdain for so-called short sellers \u2014 or fidelity to a former president. Or simply opportunism.\n\nReddit's initial public offering last week was the most anticipated debut so far this year, and it didn't disappoint, rising 48% on the first day. The stock gained an additional 30% Monday.\n\nThen Trump Media stole Reddit's thunder by jumping as much as 59% on its first day of trading Tuesday, before cooling off and closing with a gain of 16%. On Wednesday, the stock gained an additional 14% to close at $66.22. Former President Donald Trump holds a majority stake in Trump Media that could bring him billions.\n\nAnalysts and academics are comparing the surge in Reddit and Trump Media to the meme stock craze in 2021 that boosted shares of companies such as video game retailer GameStop and movie theater operator AMC Entertainment. Although there are differences between the two groups, the companies did have two prominent similarities: It was hard to look at the financials and predict a path to long-term profitability. But small investors bought in nonetheless.\n\nTrump Media lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year, when it took in just $3.4 million in revenue and had to pay $37.7 million in interest expenses. In a recent regulatory filing, the company said it will lose money \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nResearch firm Similarweb estimates that Truth Social had roughly 5 million monthly visits in February of this year. By comparison, Facebook had 15.2 billion visits, while Reddit had 2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nReddit, like its social media peers, relies on user growth and advertising revenue, but it has yet to turn a profit in its nearly 20-year history that has also been beset by management turmoil and user backlashes. About 76 million users checked into one of Reddit\u2019s roughly 100,000 communities in December, according to a regulatory disclosure.\n\nWhile Reddit and Trump Media can be considered newer technology companies, GameStop and AMC were considered to be somewhat antiquated when small investors latched onto them in late 2020 and early 2021. GameStop struggled while selling video games and consoles in stores without a digital alternative, and AMC lost billions of dollars as movie fans embraced streaming and the pandemic kept them out of theaters.\n\nGranted, GameStop had the backing of Ryan Cohen, founder of the e-commerce pet food company Chewy, who investors likely thought could modernize GameStop's business. But a number of investors were individuals who belonged to the Reddit community Wall Street Bets and bought shares in order to \u201cstick it to\u201d to big institutions that had made bets the stock would drop. As the stock took off, even more investors seized the opportunity to buy.\n\nMany of those investing in Trump Media are also small-time investors either trying to support Trump or aiming to cash in on the mania. They helped the stock of Digital World Acquisition more than double this year ahead of its merger with Trump Media, which took its place on the Nasdaq stock market. As the stock jumped Tuesday, one user urged conservatives to \u201cget behind the DJT stock and send it over $100 per share\u201d to \u201cdrive the liberals insane!\u201d\n\nData from Vanda Research show that retail investors bought $6.5 million of Trump Media shares on its first trading day and $7.9 million of Reddit shares for its debut.\n\nThe frenzy surrounding GameStop and AMC eventually died down. GameStop's market value peaked above $20 billion in January 2021; it's now just above $4 billion after Cohen's turnaround has for the most part failed to materialize. AMC's market value has dropped from a high of around $29 billion to about $1.5 billion. While both carry on \u2014 GameStop even reported a small profit for the fiscal year ended in January \u2014 analysts question their longevity.\n\nFollowing the release of GameStop's earnings report Tuesday, Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors that steeper revenue declines for the company could lead to large losses and possibly bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re right, GameStop has a likely runway of no more than five years,\u201d Pachter said.\n\nEven so, Pachter is even more skeptical of the fervor over Trump Media in the market. He notes that GameStop had revenue of more than $5 billion back in 2020 while Trump Media's revenue is under $5 million.\n\n\u201cGameStop was the meme stock of a lifetime, but Trump Media has put it to shame,\u201d Pachter said in an email.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) missed both top and bottom-line estimates with its latest quarterly report. Amid the ongoing shift to digital downloads with the rise of the cloud gaming platform by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) that accelerated the digitalization of the gaming industry, the videogame retailer delivered a lackluster fourth quarter report that after which its stock plunged in premarket trading on Wednesday.\n\nFourth quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter that ended on February 3rd,\u00a0the legacy meme stock company posted revenue of $1.79 billion, missing analyst estimates of $2.05 billion\u00a0and falling from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to $2.23 billion.\u00a0Hardware and accessories sales brough in $1.09 billion with the segment also declining 12% YoY, while software sales tanked 31% to $465 million. GameStop reported earnings of\u00a0earnings of $63.1 million.\n\nAs for the full year, GameStop posted revenue of $5.27 billion along with a profit of $6.7 million, or 2 cents per share.\n\nGameStop made quite an effort to control what it can.\n\nIn order to achieve sustainable profitability,\u00a0GameStop trimmed its workforce and even exited several international markets, namely Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. The brick-and-mortar video game company is now being challenged by both the softened consumer spending, as well as the ongoing shift to digital downloads that are hurting physical retail. Although\u00a0the video game retailer has not performed last year as well as investors hoped, GameStop did significant improvements to its balance sheet and dramatically slowed its cash burn rate with aggressive cost cuts.\u00a0Hopefully, these improvements will empower GameStop to transition to a more effective business model but significant challenges in terms of its fundamental business and long-term potential remain. GameStop has tried to diversify its revenue bit it still didn\u2019t get anywhere. Back in 2020, it announced a multiyear strategic partnership with Microsoft. But despite thinking in a good direction to\u00a0enhance its offerings and customer experience with the help Microsoft solutions,\n\nStory continues\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s comforting to know that the partnership with Microsoft equipped GameStop with the technologies to create the ultimate gaming destination. But, the tech support from Microsoft couldn\u2019t do much against rising competition from e-commerce firms and weakened consumer spending amid an uncertain economy that weighed on the entire gaming industry. Last month, U.S. videogame publishers Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (NASDAQ: TTW) and Electronic Arts Inc (NASDAQ: EA) also reported earnings that were short of analyst estimates.\n\nWhat GameStop urgently needs is to outline its long-term plan and demonstrate how it intends to last in a world where it\u2019s getting increasingly easy to become irrelevant overnight.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Why GameStop (GME) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) fell 19.9% in the pre-market session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue unfortunately falling short of analysts' expectations, driven by significant underperformance in its software segment ($465m of revenue vs. estimates of $670m). Because the company's software products have higher profit margins than its hardware products, it missed Wall Street's estimates on nearly every profitability metric. The company also didn't provide any guidance and said it would not host a conference call to discuss the results, which raises an eyebrow. Overall, this was a bad quarter for GameStop.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy GameStop? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nGameStop's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 31 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for GameStop and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock gained 6.4% on the news that the company announced the appointment of Ryan Cohen as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, effective immediately. While currently serving as Executive Chairman, Mr. Cohen will step down from this role upon assuming the position of Chairman. Cohen founded -ecommerce pet company Chewy in 2011 and served as Chewy's CEO until 2018. Following the sale of Chewy in 2017 and its IPO in 2019, Cohen disclosed a near 10% stake in GameStop in September 2020, making him the company's biggest individual investor. He then joined the board in January 2021 and has been credited with some major changes such as a few major executive replacements.\n\nGameStop is down 21.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $13.15 per share it is trading 51.2% below its 52-week high of $26.95 from June 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of GameStop's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,108.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

        "content": "(Reuters) - GameStop's shares slumped more than 18% before the bell on Wednesday, as the brick-and-mortar video game retailer reported a decline in fourth-quarter revenue on the back of a spending slowdown and rising competition from e-commerce firms.\n\nThe Grapevine, Texas-based company also said late on Tuesday that it had cut an unspecified number of jobs, joining Japan's Sony and Electronic Arts in a bid to reduce costs as economic uncertainty hits discretionary spending.\n\nGameStop is set to lose more than $900 million in its market capitalization if the premarket losses hold.\n\nAs of Tuesday, GameStop's stock had fallen nearly 12% this year, as the retail and ecommerce environment remains intensely competitive for the company, which was once a mainstay of American malls.\n\nThe company has a total of 4,169 stores as of Feb. 3, compared with 4,413 in January last year.\n\nGameStop was hailed as the pioneer of Wall Street's so-called meme stocks. The stock's price rose as much as 100 times over several months in 2021, largely on the sentiment of individual buyers connected through the Reddit community forum WallStreetBets.\n\n\"No sooner has the meme stock craze been resurrected by Donald Trump's media company enjoying a big share price boost, it's somewhat ironic that the grandfather of meme has fallen flat on its face,\" AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group rose more than 14% in premarket trading on Wednesday, a day after its stellar debut on the Nasdaq.\n\nMould added that the lack of detailed commentary about trading and the company's decision not to hold a post-earnings conference call means \"the management is hiding under a rock.\"\n\nGameStop's first adjusted per share profit in four quarters also failed to lift investors' spirits. The company's earnings were 22 cents per share on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, after breaking-even in the third quarter.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh and Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The retail investing crowd is back in the throes of a meme stock mania as encouraging messaging from the Federal Reserve, GameStop Corp.\u2019s expected earnings and sky-high stock prices ignite a euphoria among day traders.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump\u2019s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World\u2019s 500 Richest People Trump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 Million Biden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll Shows Vital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After Being Struck by Ship After Exposing Realtors, Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction\n\nIndividual investors\u2019 piece of options volume has ticked higher as traders buy calls to position for continued rallies in already frothy equity indexes. They snapped up shares of Reddit Inc. after its scorching initial public offering last week while also pumping up old classics, sparking a 15% surge in GameStop shares on Monday and rocketing Bitcoin toward fresh highs.\n\n\u201cA proper comparison would be the summer of 2021,\u201d said Vincent Deluard, StoneX\u2019s director of global macro strategy. \u201cWith last week\u2019s extremely dovish Fed meeting, we had the all-clear signal, and that was the cherry on top.\u201d\n\nInstitutional traders aren\u2019t exactly on pause with the S&P 500 Index hitting 20 new highs in less than three months this year. But demand for put options ticked up modestly from a month ago as technical strategists grow increasingly skeptical of further gains in stocks. To many Wall Street prognosticators, valuations this stretched signal a correction is coming. But to many retail traders, they mean it\u2019s time to go all-in.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500 rallied 2.3% \u2014 its largest one-week advance in three months \u2014 after the Fed signaled three rate cuts are coming this year. This week it\u2019s the shares of Wall Street Bets\u2019 darlings that have soared while the S&P has been more subdued.\n\nOn Monday, two social media platforms \u2014 Reddit Inc. and Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 jumped roughly 30% alongside GameStop\u2019s bounce. Options activity in all three was led by small lots, a sign of individual investors\u2019 involvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe largest number of Gamestop options contracts traded since the start of the year on Monday, as investors readied for the firm\u2019s earnings report, expected after markets close on Tuesday. Options markets imply a post-earnings one-day move of 23%, which, if true, would give the firm its largest single session swing in more than a year.\n\nAlso on Monday, Trump Media \u2014 then referenced by the name of the blank check firm, Digital World Acquisition Corp. \u2014 saw its second highest number of options traded for the year, topped only by Friday\u2019s activity. Reddit\u2019s options, which launched Monday, attracted some 90,000 contracts, with calls outnumbering puts. Just three hours into Tuesday\u2019s session, total volume had already topped that level.\n\nOptions \u201care an easy way for them to speculate,\u201d said Bret Kenwell, a US options investment analyst at eToro Group Ltd, noting retail trader activity in the past few sessions. \u201cWorst case they lose their premium. Best case, they have multifold returns.\u201d\n\nThe action at the start of the week dovetails trends seen all year \u2014 a warning to Fed Chair Jerome Powell that higher-for-longer-rates haven\u2019t tamed speculative buying. Retail\u2019s share of total options volume hit an all-time high earlier this year and has dropped off only slightly in recent weeks, according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co. The excitement helped push average daily options volume in February to its highest on-record, according to data from the Options Clearing Corporation.\n\nSimilar stories have unfolded in the digital asset space, with Bitcoin up some 65% since the start of the year. Crypto-exposed shares, including Robinhood Markets, Inc. and Coinbase Global Inc., have jumped as well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that meme element to it, that almost harkens back to AMC and Gamestop in 2020 and 2021,\u201d Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg TV.\n\nMeanwhile, institutional traders have shown slight signs of added caution. While demand for downside hedges dropped off somewhat this week, the price of put options crept up modestly at the start of March as the Cboe Volatility Index \u2014 or VIX \u2014 popped up from its lows near the end of last year. Overall, however, sentiment remains remarkably bullish.\n\nBut even amid the broad market euphoria, the hype from the Wall Street Bets crowd stand outs. For now, retail traders seem content to be relishing in a \u201cparty-on environment,\u201d said Brent Kochuba, founder of options platform SpotGamma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like musical chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless the music stops, it just keeps going.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Rita Nazareth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland China AI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon Valley In This Coworking Space, Only the Cappuccino Isn\u2019t Classified Jokes, Pop Music and Radical Honesty: How TikTok Is Changing Home Sales Weight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey Meds\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By Priyanka G and Harshita Mary Varghese\n\n(Reuters) -Videogame retailer GameStop said on Tuesday it had cut an unspecified number of jobs to reduce costs and reported lower fourth-quarter revenue amid rising competition from e-commerce firms and weak consumer spending in an uncertain economy.\n\nShares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company tumbled 16% in extended trade.\n\n\"An increasing mix of digital downloads is hurting physical retail, and there is simply no reason to go to the store if a consumer can just order a game and download it immediately,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Revenues are highly unlikely to rebound unless management figures out a way to drive store traffic.\"\n\nU.S. videogame publishers Take-Two Interactive Software and Electronic Arts also delivered lackluster earnings last month as the gaming industry faces pressure from high borrowing costs, sticky inflation and a slowdown in demand from pandemic peaks.\n\nGameStop's recent cost-reduction measures also included an exit from its operations in Ireland, Switzerland and Austria.\n\nAs of Feb. 3, the company had about 8,000 full-time salaried and hourly associates and between 13,000 and 18,000 part-time, hourly associates worldwide. That compares to 11,000 full-time salaried and hourly employees and between 14,000 and 27,000 part-time hourly employees in 2023.\n\nIts expenses fell 21.2% to $357.1 million, primarily due to lower costs of labor, consulting services and marketing.\n\n\"I suspect that they will keep trimming costs to generate breakeven or better, but it is inevitable that their sales will decline to an unsustainable level,\" Pachter said.\n\nGameStop's fourth-quarter revenue of $1.79 billion was lower than last year's $2.23 billion, as it also grappled with stiff competition from Amazon.com and Ebay.\n\nIt reported adjusted earnings per share of 22 cents, compared with 16 cents a year earlier.\n\nSeparately, the company promoted Daniel Moore to principal financial officer.

It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per share, improving from its profit of $0.16 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy GameStop? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nGameStop (GME) Q4 CY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $1.79 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.05 billion (12.5% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.22 vs analyst expectations of $0.30 (25.4% miss) Gross Margin (GAAP): 23.4%, up from 22.4% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$18.7 million, down from $326.6 million in the same quarter last year GME did not provide any forward-looking guidance Market Capitalization: $4.62 billion\n\nDrawing gaming fans with demo units set up with the latest releases, GameStop (NYSE:GME) sells new and used video games, consoles, and accessories, as well as pop culture merchandise.\n\nElectronics & Gaming Retailer\n\nAfter a long day, some of us want to just watch TV, play video games, listen to music, or scroll through our phones; electronics and gaming retailers sell the technology that makes this possible, plus more. Shoppers can find everything from surround-sound speakers to gaming controllers to home appliances in their stores. Competitive prices and helpful store associates that can talk through topics like the latest technology in gaming and installation keep customers coming back. This is a category that has moved rapidly online over the last few decades, so these electronics and gaming retailers have needed to be nimble and aggressive with their e-commerce and omnichannel investments.\n\nSales Growth\n\nGameStop is a mid-sized retailer, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better economies of scale. On the other hand, it has an edge over smaller competitors with fewer resources and can still flex high growth rates because it's growing off a smaller base than its larger counterparts.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you can see below, the company's revenue has declined over the last four years, dropping 5% annually as its store count and sales at existing, established stores have both shrunk. GameStop Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, GameStop missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 19.4% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $1.79 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to decline 1.4% over the next 12 months.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth and demand for retailers.\n\nGameStop's demand has been shrinking over the last eight quarters, and on average, its same-store sales have declined by 3.2% year on year. The company has been reducing its store count as fewer locations sometimes lead to higher same-store sales, but that hasn't been the case here. GameStop Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nKey Takeaways from GameStop's Q4 Results\n\nWe struggled to find many strong positives in these results. GameStop's revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations, driven by significant underperformance in its software segment ($465m of revenue vs estimates of $670m). Because the company's software products have higher profit margins than its hardware products, it missed Wall Street's estimates on nearly every profitability metric. The company also didn't provide any guidance and said it would not host a conference call today to discuss the results, which raises an eyebrow. Overall, this was a bad quarter for GameStop. The company is down 17% and currently trades at $12.89 per share.\n\nGameStop may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.",

Long-term debt remains limited to a low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19.\n\nFULL YEAR OVERVIEW\n\nNet sales were $5.273 billion for fiscal year 2023, compared to $5.927 billion for fiscal year 2022.  SG&A expenses were $1.324 billion, or 25.1% of net sales, for fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.681 billion, or 28.4% of net sales, for fiscal year 2022.  Net income was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to a net loss of $313.1 million for fiscal year 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA of $64.7 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($192.7) million for fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe Company will not be holding a conference call today. Additional information can be found in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K.\n\nNON-GAAP MEASURES AND OTHER METRICS\n\nAs a supplement to the Company\u2019s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), GameStop may use certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s core operating performance. Adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA exclude the effect of items such as certain transformation costs, asset impairments, severance, as well as divestiture costs. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures otherwise included in net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities. The Company\u2019s definition and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company\u2019s actual and future financial condition and performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS - SAFE HARBOR\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

GameStop Corp.\r\nSchedule III\r\n(in millions)\r\n(unaudited)\n\nNon-GAAP results\n\nThe following table reconciles the Company's cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities as presented in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and prepared in accordance with GAAP to its free cash flow. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use by investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s financial performance.\n\n14 Weeks Ended\r\nFebruary 3, 2024 13 Weeks Ended\r\nJanuary 28, 2023 53 Weeks Ended\r\nFebruary 3, 2024 52 Weeks Ended\r\nJanuary 28, 2023 Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities $ (11.0 ) $ 338.2 $ (203.7 ) $ 108.2 Capital expenditures (7.7 ) (11.6 ) (34.9 ) (55.9 ) Free cash flow $ (18.7 ) $ 326.6 $ (238.6 ) $ 52.3\n\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Metrics\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share are supplemental financial measures of the Company\u2019s performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, plus net interest income, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transformation costs, business divestitures, fixed asset impairments, severance and certain other non-cash charges. Net income (loss) is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Furthermore, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Some of these limitations include:\n\ncertain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company\u2019s financial performance, such as a company\u2019s cost of capital and tax structure; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and our computations of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nWe compensate for the limitations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measure, understanding the differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decision-making process. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share may be defined and determined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\n\nContact\n\nGameStop Corp.

        "content": "Reddit became synonymous with the meme stock rally of 2021. Now, its stock has become a meme itself.\n\nReddit stock (RDDT) popped more than 12% on Tuesday and has rallied more than 30% since its initial public offering (IPO) last Thursday. Some reports have pegged an uptick in options volume to the recent surge in shares.\n\nThe meme resurgence spans beyond one popular IPO. GameStop (GME), the original meme stock, just had its best one day rise in a year. The Donald Trump-tied media SPAC finally debuted under the name Trump Media and Technology Group and ticker symbol DJT. That stock was up more than 50% during Tuesday's trading session alone.\n\n\"We are in a very exuberant market,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"We're in a very momentum driven market. One of the hallmarks of momentum is it becomes far less about fundamentals. It becomes all about price movement and much less about about valuation. Meme stocks are the epitome of that.\"\n\nBeyond those popular names, other signs of a risk-on market are flashing, too.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has pressed near $71,000 per coin. Microstrategy (MSTR), a stock that more closely follows the price of Bitcoin than typical fundamental drivers like earnings, is now up more than 200% year-to-date after a massive rally on Monday.\n\nAnd the commodities trade is ripping, too, with gold (GC=F) up 7% in the last month and sitting near an all-time high. The price of cocoa (CC=F) has risen nearly 50% over the same time period.\n\nTo Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders, these moves are signs of \"froth\" in the market.\n\n\"It's sort of the bull market in everything recently with the exception of maybe bonds,\" Sonders said. \"It's in crypto, it's in precious metals, it's in certain other commodities. It's in some of the meme stocks, again, and it is [all part] of the mix.\" CEO of Reddit Steve Huffman stands next to Snoo, the mascot of Reddit, at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 21, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe big moves come as the broader market sits at all-time highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has hit 20 all-time highs in less than three months of trading this year, putting it on pace for the most record closes in any year ever. The \"straight-up and to the right\" nature of the benchmark's rise over the last several months \u2014 it hasn't produced a negative month since October 2023 \u2014 has had many asking if we're in a stock market bubble that's about to pop.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany strategists have argued the answer is no.\n\nIn a research note on Monday, Deutsche Bank's equity strategy team reasoned that the $260 billion that's poured into equities since last May doesn't indicate a peak in risk appetite. Instead, it's been supported by an improving outlook for both the economy and earnings.\n\nDeutsche Bank director of global asset allocation and US equity strategy Parag Thatte told Yahoo Finance the firm hasn't seen flows data pick up purely because of risk appetite yet.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter GameStop reported revenues of $1.08 billion, down 9.1% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 8.8%. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates.\u00a0On the other hand, its revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations, driven by worse-than-expected hardware and software sales.\n\nIs GameStop buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting GameStop's revenue to decline 7.9% year on year to $2.05 billion, a further deceleration on the 1.2% year-over-year decrease in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.30 per share. GameStop Total Revenue\n\nMajority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last thirty days, suggesting they are expecting the business to stay the course heading into the earnings. The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates four times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at GameStop's peers in the specialty retail segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Best Buy's revenues decreased 0.6% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 0.6% and Ulta reported revenues up 10.2% year on year, exceeding estimates by 0.8%. Best Buy traded down 2.7% on the results, and Ulta was down 3.5%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Best Buy's results here and Ulta's results here.\n\nInvestors in the specialty retail segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks up on average 0.7% over the last month. GameStop is up 8.8% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $6, compared to share price of $14.85.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

The stock soared roughly 60% to trade above $53 in the first minutes of trading as a public company.\n\nThe company's debut on the New York Stock Exchange had been highly anticipated, given the lull in public listings over the past two years. Reddit is the first major social media company to go public since Pinterest (PINS) in 2019.\n\nThe user-generated discussion-style platform has been around since 2005, but it gained increased recognition during the meme frenzy in 2021. At that time, retail traders on the subreddit WallStreetBets encouraged short squeezes on shares of video game retailer GameStop (GME), theater chain (AMC), and other heavily shorted stocks.\n\nThe IPO is expected to gauge investors\u2019 appetite for tech-related offerings at a time when monetary policy is tight.

About 98% of sales in the third quarter of last year were generated from advertising on the platform.\n\nThe company's net loss narrowed from $158.6 million in 2022 to $90.8 million last year.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman noted that the company was profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the second half of last year.\n\n\u201cI think if we can keep doing that we\u2019re in great shape,\u201d Huffman told Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi ahead of the listing on Thursday morning. \u201cWe have such high margins that if just continue to sell and be mindful about costs, this company scales in a really impressive way.\u201d\n\nThe site had 500 million monthly visitors in December 2023, the S-1 filing said, and an average of 73.1 million unique daily active users during the three months ending in December.\n\nReddit's filing also noted the company sees an opportunity to license its data for AI use.\n\n\u201cOn the data side we\u2019ve got almost two decades of human conversations about anything and everything. In an AI world, where everything is increasingly written by AI, the human-generated content actually becomes more valuable over time,\u201d Huffman said on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a nod to Redditors, the company set aside 1.76 million shares for sale to eligible users and moderators on the platform, with no lock-up period.\n\nThe move lends itself to volatility, said Headline venture partner Kamran Ansari told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.\n\n\"You may see a big run-up in the stock price and a drop,\" he said. \"Because this has such a rabid community around it, the Reddit users, you could see Reddit itself ironically become a meme stock the way that you saw happen with like AMC and GameStop.\"\n\nInes is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Reddit IPO: The company is ready for more AI and advertising, says CEO",
        "content": "New investors shouldn't call Reddit (RDDT) an AI play even after a lucrative deal with tech beast Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nOr so says co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman.\n\n\"I think they should look at Reddit as a community platform that has many paths to success,\" Huffman told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, as his 19-year old company went public on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nReddit is pursuing more deals that feeds its data to large language models (LLMs), according to Huffman, but the company is also aiming to grab a bigger piece of the advertising pie.\n\nInitially expected to price its IPO in the $31 to $34 per share range, Reddit ended up pricing its IPO at $34 late Wednesday, giving it a $6.4 billion valuation initially.\n\nThe targeted valuation on a fully diluted basis was less than the $10 billion valuation it fetched in a 2021 funding round.\n\nAs of 12:15 p.m. ET, Reddit shares hadn't yet opened for trading. Indications had it opening in the $42 to $48 a share range.\n\nReddit is the first major social media IPO since Pinterest (PINS) debuted in 2019.\n\nThe Road to the Reddit IPO\n\nIt's been a long-winding road for Huffman \u2014 an avid ballroom dancer in his college days \u2014 and the Reddit team to reach its Thursday IPO.\n\nThe company \u2014 which Huffman frequently says is not a social media platform but a democratic community \u2014 was founded by Huffman and friend Alexis Ohanian in 2005.\n\nThe pair sold Reddit to Conde Nast a year later for a reported $10 million. Huffman stayed on until his contract ended in 2009. Ohanian left in 2010. Welcome to public markets, Reddit. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nConde Nast's parent company Advance Publications spun off the business in 2011. After churning through two CEOs, Reddit brought back Ohanian as executive chairman in 2014, then Huffman as CEO a year later.\n\nSince then, Huffman has waded into hot button content moderation topics on the platform, run the business during the meme stock uprising, and pivoted the company to capitalize on advertising dollars.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore recently, Reddit struck a $60 million deal to license its data to help train Google's LLMs. The potential for more AI licensing deals were a key pitch to investors during its IPO roadshow.\n\nOhanian left in 2020, noting he wanted his board seat given to a diverse candidate. Interestingly, mentions of him were left out of Reddit's prospectus.\n\nDespite being in business for almost 20 years, Reddit has never turned a profit. Last year the company saw sales rise 21% year over year to $804 million. The net loss clocked in at $90.8 million. Its daily users tally about 73 million strong.\n\n\"I like the trend we are on,\" Huffman said when asked if adjusted profits achieved in late 2023 would continue in 2024. He declined to say if Reddit would be profitable in 2024.\n\nOther facts to know:\n\nAI kingmaker Sam Altman and Chinese tech giant Tencent are Reddit\u2019s fourth and second largest shareholders, respectively. Huffman\u2019s total 2023 compensation stood at $193.2 million, which includes $93.7 million in options awards and $98.3 million in stock awards. Key call out from its SEC filing: \u201cOur Chief Executive Officer, Steven Huffman, holds 662,447 PRSUs for shares of our Class B common stock that are issuable upon achievement of a vesting condition that will be deemed satisfied based on our attaining a $5.0 billion market capitalization valuation following this offering.\u201d The GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) meme stock trading saga was mentioned in the company\u2019s risk factor section. 1.76 million shares were reserved for the Reddit user base to buy.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Shorting the Shorts: 3 Stocks Primed for an Epic Squeeze",
        "content": "Danish researchers published a report on the arXiv.org open-access archive for scholarly articles in February about the Jan. 2021 short squeeze of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). The researchers found that the subreddit community WallStreetBets 's(WSB) desire to find and invest in stocks primed for short squeeze had a role in GME\u2019s short squeeze from more than three years ago.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe estimated that the size of the total position of WSB users amounted to at least 1% of GME market capitalization, demonstrating a tangible engagement of the WSB community in the stock market\u201d the report\u2019s conclusion stated.\u00a0\n\nThere is no question that the WSB community affected GameStop\u2019s massive short squeeze, which saw GME stock go from less than $5 to over $80 in three weeks. While WSB's influence isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it once was, Reddit is set to go public in mere days, a sign that it\u2019s become part of the investment community\u2019s inner circle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMaybe there won\u2019t be another one like GME\u2019s, but just in case, here are three stocks primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\nMGP Ingredients (MGPI)\n\nMGP Ingredients (NASDAQ:MGPI) used to produce distilled spirits for other brands. In April 2021, it diversified into its own brands when it acquired Luxco, a maker of bourbon brands such as Rebel Yell, for $475 million. The acquisition was part of the company\u2019s growth stategy focused on producing higher-value products.\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, its Luxco division acquired Penelope Bourbon for $105 million plus potential payouts of $111 million based on meeting specific performance targets.\n\nPenelope was already being distilled at MGP\u2019s Lawrenceburg, Indiana distillery, so the acquisition makes sense. Penelope sells 50,000 cases annually, growing by more than 160% year-over-year.\u00a0\n\nNot everyone believes MGP\u2019s premiumization strategy is a good idea. As of Feb. 15, it had 3.28 million shares short, accounting for 23.73% of its float. The company reported full-year results on Feb. 22.\u00a0\n\nThe move into higher-value products increased its gross margin by 610 basis points in 2023 to 42.5%. The company's adjusted operating income increased 21% in 2023 to $180.3 million, a 21.6% operating margin, 260 basis points higher than a year ago.\u00a0\n\nMGPI stock is primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEncore Wire (WIRE)\n\nEncore Wire (NYSE:WIRE) is a Texas-based manufacturer of copper and aluminum building wire used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The company started in 1989, going public three years later, in July 1992, around $3 a share.\u00a0\n\nI first recommended Encore in December 2022, along with six other small-cap stocks. My sentiment was the same then, as it is now, that it would continue to capture market share. Encore's shares are up 59% in the 15 months since, 29% better than the S&amp;P 500.\n\nEncore had a down year this past year due to a 17.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire in 2023, partly offset by a 6.7% increase in pounds of copper shipped. As a result of the nearly 15% decline in revenue in 2023 to $2.57 billion, Encore's gross profit margin fell 11.4 percentage points to 25.5% from 36.9% a year earlier.\u00a0\n\nPrices are a part of the business it can\u2019t control. However, It can control its balance sheet. As of Dec. 31, Encore had no outstanding long-term debt and $560.6 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. That was down from 2022 but still represented a high 16% of its market capitalization.\u00a0\n\nAs of Feb. 15, it had 3.36 million shares short, accounting for 22.87% of its float.\u00a0\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH)\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is having a down year by its standards, up 61% in 2024. Over the past five years, it\u2019s gained a whopping 5,387%. It is the modern version of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m unsure why investors would short Celsius, given that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is in its corner. In Aug. 2022, PepsiCo invested $550 million in Celsius convertible preferred shares, which pay a 5% annual dividend and are convertible into 8.5% of the company\u2019s common stock at $75 a share, solidifying its role as the U.S. distributor.\u00a0\n\nOn Jan. 22, Celsius announced expansion into Canada through Pepsi\u2014I\u2019ve seen it prominently placed in my local grocery store\u2014and the UK and Ireland through Suntory Beverage &amp; Food.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, Celsius\u2019s revenues were $1.32 billion, 102% higher than a year earlier. North American revenues were up 105%, while international revenues saw a 52% boost. Celsius's gross margin also increased 660 basis points YOY to 48.0%.\u00a0\n\nIts adjusted EBITDA jumped 316% to $295.6 million, an EBITDA margin of 22.4%. In comparison, Monster Beverage\u2019s EBITDA margin in 2023 was 28.5%, 610 basis points higher. However, Monster\u2019s margin is barely growing, while Celsius has plenty of room to grow its margin over the next several years.\u00a0\n\nCelsius has 36.31 million shares sold short, accounting for 22.81% of its float. Of the three names covered here, CELH would be my least likely to short.",

        "title": "Exit Alert: 3 Overhyped Stocks With Weak Fundamentals",
        "content": "Throughout the history of financial markets, there is ample evidence of irrational investor behavior leading to euphoria. Be it the Tulip Mania of 1634 or the Housing Bubble and the subsequent financial crisis, markets tend to react on the extremes. Even today, I can spot quality stocks deeply undervalued and ignored. On the other hand, there are overhyped stocks to sell that represent companies with weak fundamentals.\n\nI must add here that investors can leverage on bullish sentiments for an industry to make quick money. That can be through exposure to fundamentally weak stocks. However, it\u2019s important to curb the greed and exit at the right time. Further, not all stocks in a downtrend become attractive. There are overhyped stocks that look attractive on deep correction, but it\u2019s a value trap.\n\nWith the markets facing macroeconomic headwinds, it\u2019s important to be cautiously optimistic. I would remain overweight on blue-chip stocks and fundamentally strong growth stocks. However, ideas with weak fundamentals and stretched valuations need to be avoided or sold. Let\u2019s discuss three overhyped stocks to sell now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) In this photo illustration the GameStop (GME) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) stock has remained in a sustained downtrend. However, the correction does not imply that the stock is undervalued. GME stock remains expensive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 97. While the stock remains popular among meme stocks, it\u2019s a good idea to exit with further downside likely.\n\nFor Q3 2023, GameStop reported revenue of $1 billion. On a year-on-year basis, revenue has continued to witness a decline. At the same time, GameStop continues to report operating-level losses.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that GameStop had $1.2 billion in cash and equivalents as of Q3 2023. That\u2019s unlikely to be a positive catalyst, with the core business remaining sluggish.\n\nI must add that hardware as a percentage of total sales was at 54.7% for the first 10 months of 2023. On a year-on-year basis, hardware sales increased as a percentage of total sales. With the gaming hardware business remaining intensely competitive, it\u2019s unlikely there will be any significant margin improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) stock has always been in the limelight when talking about Chinese EV stocks. However, Nio has disappointed, and the stock has been in a correction mode. I further believe the stock will continue to erode value for investors.\n\nIf I had to choose a Chinese EV stock for long-term exposure, it would be names like BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI). From the perspective of fundamentals and key margins, these ideas are attractive compared to Nio.\n\nFor Q3 2023, Nio reported revenue growth of 45.9% on a year-on-year basis to $2.4 billion. However, the company reported an operating loss of $664 million for the period. In an intensely competitive market, operating level losses will likely sustain.\n\nWhile Nio reported a strong cash buffer of $6.2 billion as of Q3, dilution will likely impact sentiments. In December 2023, the company announced a $2.2 billion strategic investment from CYVN Holdings L.L.C.\n\nNovavax (NVAX) Novavax (NVAX) research laboratory logotype enlarged with a magnifying glass.This laboratory has developed a vaccine against the covid-19 virus. NVAX price predictions.\n\nSource: pixinoo / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock was among the hottest names during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the biopharmaceutical company turned out to be a laggard in the COVID-19 vaccine race. As a result, the stock has plummeted.\n\nIn the recent past, NVAX stock has, however, surged by more than 50% from 52-week lows of $3.5. For traders, it\u2019s a good opportunity to exit. I believe the stock will trend lower with fundamentals remaining weak.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and R21 for malaria have been authorized. However, the stock reaction is a clear indication that these candidates won\u2019t likely drive growth. The current pipeline has a COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccine combination in phase two.\n\nTherefore, the pipeline is narrow and is unlikely to create value. Of course, there is a case for the addition of new molecular entities in the pipeline. However, it will be years before the impact of commercialization is seen.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For the most part, Reddit\u2019s picks from 2021 haven\u2019t panned out well at all over the long term. You probably aren\u2019t going to find any standout stocks in the same place where you are finding fail videos and extremist political ramblings. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), for example, closed at $4.36 on March 1, versus its 2021 high of nearly $500, while GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), finished at $14.95 on March 1, down from its 2021 high of $120.75. Another Reddit favorite from a few years ago, Bed, Bath and Beyond, even went bankrupt, while headphone maker Koss Corporation (NASDAQ:KOSS) tumbled from its 2021 high of $127 to $2.50.\n\nEven Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) which has been relatively successful amid the resilience of crypto prices, is still trading well below its 2021 high of $369. Those stocks\u2019 track records show that, over the longer term, powerful fundamentals and huge opportunities win out over bursts of popularity that are completely unjustified by fundamentals and reality-based outlooks. With that in mind, here are three stocks to buy that will indeed climb over the long term because their issuing firms have excellent businesses and great, easily converted opportunities.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is benefiting a great deal from its focus on helping its customers implement AI and shift to a mix of public and private clouds. As a result, it\u2019s one of the best stocks to buy currently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the firm\u2019s Watsonx AI platform is proving to be quite popular, with more than 150 enterprioses, including Citi (NYSE:C), NASA, and Samsung, using the system as of last July.\n\nFurthermore, IBM has since made the platform more appealing by partnering with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud unit, AWS, to allow its customers \u201cto quickly and responsibly scale AI workloads by using a comprehensive stack of generative AI, which consists of Amazon Bedrock and IBM watsonx running on AWS Cloud and across hybrid cloud environments.\u00a0\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs more organizations greatly increase their use of AI, the growth of the firm\u2019s Data & AI revenue will accelerate, Seeking Alpha columnist Uttam Dey recently predicted.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. GOOG stock and GOOGL stock.\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had more than its share of skeptics in recent weeks, as bears have questioned whether the firm\u2019s search engine can withstand challenges from AI chatbots and the answers provided by its own AI to certain questions offended some users.\n\nHowever, old habits are hard to break, so I predict that most users will continue to rely on Google\u2019s search engine for many years to come. Furthermore, according to a majority of sources, Alphabet\u2019s underlying AI technology is actually very strong.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the tech giant, which had nearly $111 billion of cash as of the end of last quarter, can afford to make acquisitions and hire many experts to greatly improve the quality of its AI offerings over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m confident that by 2030, Waymo will contribute considerable amounts to the firm\u2019s top and bottom lines.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nComputer network equipment maker Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported strong fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12, showing that it\u2019s benefiting meaningfully from the AI boom.\n\nThe firm\u2019s top line climbed by an impressive 21% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income rose to $513.6 million, up from $427.1 million in Q4 of 2022.\n\nAmong the company\u2019s most prolific customers are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta (NASDAQ: META), which are also two of the largest beneficiaries of the AI Revolution. As MSFT and Meta continue to get big boosts from their deployment of AI, Arista\u2019s financial results should continue to surge.\n\nAmong the 21 Wall Street analysts who cover the name, 13 rate it a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and two have \u201cBuy\u201d ratings on it.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company\u2019s earnings per share to advance to $7.59 this year and $8.56 next year from the $6.94 of EPS that it generated in 2023.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a short position in COIN.

        "content": "Warren Buffett cautioned he's seeing signs of excess in markets, likening their price action to a casino.\n\n\"For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casinolike behavior than they did when I was young,\" Buffett told Fortune magazine.\n\nWhile he might've been talking about stock markets, even more volatility in the crypto markets caused Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) to be temporarily unable to handle the load.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth. Harvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.\n\nFor a brief time, many Coinbase users saw zero account balances and were unable to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe chaos reminded some traders of Robinhood Market Inc.'s (NASDAQ:HOOD) 2021 fiasco caused by the unexpected rise in meme stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME).\n\nA popular Reddit post titled \"Dear Coinbase \u2013 Enjoy your Robinhood Moment\" expressed disappointment in the similarities.\n\nWhile the incident caused Coinbase's stock to dip slightly, it's still up about 215% over the past year, largely because of the rise of Bitcoin and the increased trading fees generated from the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe increased trading fees that both Coinbase and Robinhood have achieved are likely all part of what Buffett was voicing his displeasure over.\n\nTrending: Investing in startups isn\u2019t just for Silicon Valley elite. Ordinary individuals like you have the power to support innovative ventures and reap substantial rewards.\n\nBuffett's late business partner Charlie Munger bluntly assessed Robinhood in 2021, saying, \"I think it's just God awful that something like that brought investments from civilized men and decent citizens. It's deeply wrong. We don't want to make our money selling things that are bad for people.\"\n\nBuffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) might not have had the same gains as Coinbase over the past year, but it still achieved a roughly 33.3% gain over the past year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne benefit to owning Berkshire has been its relatively low volatility compared to the more speculative Coinbase as well as its proven staying power over time.\n\nWhile times have changed, Buffett believes the speculative behavior of investors hasn't, saying, \"Today's active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school.\"\n\nBuffett bought his first stock in 1941, a full 71 years before Coinbase was founded.\n\nWho will have better returns over the next 71 years is sure to be a debate.\n\nRead Next:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best short squeeze stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our primer on short squeezing, and some of the greatest short squeezes in history, then you can take a look at the\u00a05 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nShort selling is one of the most controversial aspects of the stock market. After all, investing is typically thought to be a 'value creating' endeavor, where both retail and professional players engage in trading to pick the right stock and make millions if not billions of dollars.\n\nOn the flip side, short selling comes with the aim of profiting from the drop in share price. Those who argue in its favor belief that it allows market players to exploit weaknesses and be rewarded for their actions. A rather controversial practice short sellers benefit when the shares of a firm, such as the well known U.S. green vehicle designer Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) or the Indian business conglomerate Adani Enterprises Limited (NSE:ADANIENT.NS), drop in value. Yet, this same drop harms existing investors as well, an occurrence that ensures that short selling will remain controversial as long as the stock markets continue to exist.\n\nWhile the profits of short selling stocks are lucrative, at the same time, betting against the wrong names can be disastrous and wipe out entire portfolios. While short sellers who target Nikola and Adani ended up being richer, the stock market is also filled with examples of stocks that ended up being short squeeze stocks. One source of controversy surrounding short selling surrounds the fact that bets against a stock are publicly visible. So, you can see what the short interest in a stock that trades on the NASDAQ exchange is simply by visiting the exchange's website. As a result, at least when it comes to the retail front, if a stock has a substantial amount of short interest, then investors looking to pick it as a long term, value creating investment will naturally wonder if there's something under the hood that's amiss.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, and particularly as events after the coronavirus pandemic have shown, short squeeze stocks can also change the fortunes of those lucky or wise enough to pick them. The pandemic, which saw populations all over the world sent indoors, also led to the two biggest short squeezes in history, the meme stocks GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC). GameStop's short squeeze dented Wall Street in ways previously unimaginable, and it even led to Senate hearings of Reddit forum members.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the all time legendary short squeeze stocks, while GameStop is well known, there are tons of others that have made even larger impacts. For instance, even as of 2021, when Insider Monkey took a look at 10 Biggest Short Squeezes of All Time, the biggest short squeeze after 13 years was Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY). The Volkswagen short squeeze cost short sellers more than three times in losses than GameStop, fueled by the fact that as Volkwagen's shares soared, it became the most valuable company in the world with a share price of \u20ac999.\n\nThe saga of Volkswagen's legendary short squeeze is more complex than the tale written by the GameStop traders. At its heart was the hedge fund industry, which sought to exploit the price differential between the firm's preferred and ordinary stock in the aftermath of legal developments in Germany that enabled a Volkswagen takeover through holding a 75% interest in the firm. Preferred stock, for those out of the loop, is a dividend paying security that does not offer its holder a stake in a publicly traded company's governance.\n\nWhen the difference in the prices between the two share classes started to grow, investors sold 12% of the ordinary shares short. But, they were caught with their pants down after Porsche revealed that it had quietly bought nearly 75% of Volkswagen's stock. This meant that as Porsche and a German State owned nearly 94% of the shares, half of those who had shorted the stock would be left without the ability to close their bets. Consequently, the mad scupper to buy Volkswagen shares ensured that Volkswagen became the world's most valuable company.

While nobody can pick such stocks and the ones today could very well drop instead, we did try and the top names were Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH), Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA), and\u00a0Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA). 13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA professional banker wearing a suit and tie, helping a customer deposit money.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best short squeeze stocks, we first made a list of stocks with 20% of their float sold short, price 10% above 200 day simple moving average, shortable options, and a relative volume greater than 25%. They were then ranked by the number of hedge fund investors that had invested in them as of Q4 2023 end.\n\nFor these short squeeze stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now\n\n13. Tango Therapeutics, Inc.

To read the second part of this article, click 5 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nIt's commonly said among investor circles that short selling is one of the most difficult strategies to make money in the stock market. The events of 2023 showed why. According to S3 Partners, short sellers lost about $178 billion in 2023 amid broader stock market rally driven by the AI boom. Most of these losses for short sellers came from Magnificent Seven stocks. A Yahoo Finance's analysis of S3 Partners' data showed that the biggest losses for short sellers came from Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta and Apple.\n\nIt seems short sellers are experiencing a squeeze from all sides as new regulations and a generally tough environment makes betting against stocks difficult by the day. Last year the SEC finalized new rules that would require hedge funds to tell the SEC which companies they sell short. Institutional money managers with large short positions will have to file forms with details of their short bets with the SEC. The new rules come two years after the 2021 short squeeze drama which saw Redditors band together to boost share prices of companies like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) that were heavily shorted by major hedge funds.\n\nShort selling remains an important trading activity that, in many cases, puts a much-needed check on companies and provides interesting data points and perspectives for the broader market. That's why it's important to keep an eye on short interest of stocks. Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now\n\nLuis Louro / shutterstock.com Methodology\n\nLast month, BofA published its Managers\u2019 Holdings Update report in which it listed stocks with the least short interest by hedge funds as a percentage of float. For this article we scanned BofA list of least shorted stocks and picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nStory continues\n\n15. Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 53\n\nWater treatment services and solutions company Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL) ranks 15th in our list of the least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nOf the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, 53 hedge funds had stakes in Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL). The most notable stakeholder of Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL)\u00a0was Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust which owns an $884 million stake in Ecolab Inc (NYSE:ECL).\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cLong-time ClearBridge holding\u00a0Ecolab Inc. (NYSE:ECL) stands out as a responsible steward of water resources and a company able to reduce impact from use of water across the economy. Ecolab offers water-saving solutions for laundries used by health care, hospitality and food and beverage industries. Products and services include industrial water pre-treatment systems, industrial water reuse, water-efficient conveyor lubrication systems and wastewater treatment. For a major hotel chain, Ecolab\u2019s chemical product delivery service replaces single-use drums of cleaning chemical, reducing waste and improving work safety, while its warewashing and housekeeping solutions reduce wash time, water usage and water temperature for food prep wares as well as plastic packaging used in housekeeping services. Ecolab estimates 57 million gallons of water savings as well as 1,400 metric tons of GHG emissions annually for the hotel chain as a result.\n\nEcolab has committed to helping its customers conserve 300 billion gallons of water a year, equivalent to the annual drinking water needs of 1 billion people by 2030, through reducing water withdrawal needs in customers\u2019 operations. Separately, Ecolab also has a target to restore >50% of its absolute water withdrawal at high-risk sites through collaboration with NGOs and local communities. Ecolab is also a co-founder of the Water Resilience Coalition, a CEO-led movement and part of the United Nations Global Compact aiming to preserve the world\u2019s freshwater resources through action in water-stressed basins.\u201d\n\n14. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nWith over six decades of dividend increases and a highly resilient business, Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) is one of the best least shorted stocks to buy according to smart money investors.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO).\n\nUnlike AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME), Coca-Cola does not have a history of attracting short sellers in the past.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n13. Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 59\n\nMedical device company Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\u00a0shares have gained about 4.7% year to date in 2024 through February 6.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 59 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT). The biggest stakeholder in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT)\u00a0was Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management which owns a $477 million stake in Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT).\n\n12. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 62\n\nBofA's research shows Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\u00a0had just 0.54% short interest as a percentage of float, which makes it one of the least shorted stocks.\n\nOf the 62 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database that had stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)\u00a0as of the end of the third quarter, Terry Smith's Fundsmith LLP had a $1.4 billion stake in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM).\n\n11. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 65\n\nBofA's research shows that Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is one of the least shorted stocks on the Wall Street, with just 0.64% short interest as a percentage of float. Last month, Piper Sandler added to the stock to its high conviction stocks list. Piper Sandler said the stock scores well on profitability, earnings growth and free cash flow generation.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds had stakes in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\u00a0as of the end of the third quarter. The biggest stake in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)\u00a0is owned by Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which owns a $1.1 billion stake.\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe added to our position in\u00a0Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products used to treat atrial fibrillation, such as pulsed field ablation, among others. The company held an Investor Day in September at which management established financial targets for the 2024 to 2026 period calling for an organic sales CAGR of 8% to 10%, 150 basis points of margin expansion, and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improved free-cash-flow conversion. We think this growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.\u201d\n\n10. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 69\n\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the top least shorted stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. Last month Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $1.19 meeting estimates. Revenue in the quarter jumped 1.4% year over year to $10.24 billion, surpassing estimates by $50 million.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, \u00a069 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). The biggest stakeholder of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)\u00a0during this period was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $939 million stake in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cHealth care facilities operator HCA Healthcare and medical device company\u00a0Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) were also among our bottom contributors. Abbott Labs was impacted by concerns about potential threats to its diabetes franchise from new drugs. A majority of Abbott\u2019s continuous glucose monitor (CGM) customers rely on insulin for their treatment, which means their disease will not respond to the newer medications. This concern negatively impacted investor sentiment and, in turn, Abbott\u2019s share price, leading to underperformance in the recent quarter.\u201d\n\n9. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 75\n\nConsumer goods giant Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\u00a0has a very low short interest as the Wall Street views it as a defensive and safe play to buy, thanks to its diversified business and over six decades of consistent dividend increases.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 75 hedge funds out of the 910 funds had stakes in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). The biggest stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)\u00a0is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nWhile AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) have a history of attracting short bets from hedge funds, it's a rarity to see money managers going against established giants like Procter & Gamble.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe sold The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). After two years of strong pricing growth, the company is facing slower market growth in both the US and Europe. China, the company\u2019s second largest individual market, is facing a protracted downturn with poor visibility on when fundamentals will improve.\u201d\n\n8. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 80\n\nWalmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is one of the top least shorted stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. As of the end of the September 2023 quarter, 80 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).\n\nCiti recently published its list of top large-cap stock recommendations. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u00a0made it to the list. Citi estimates EPS of Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)\u00a0to come in at $7.32 this year while P/E is expected to be at 22.\n\n7. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 84\n\nWith decades of consistent dividend increases and strong fundamentals, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) ranks seventh in our list of the best least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nLast month Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)\u00a0posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.29, beating estimates by $0.01. Revenue in the period jumped 73% year over year to $21.4 billion.\n\nOf the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, 84 hedge funds had stakes in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe health care space provided some opportunities in the quarter, as we increased our exposure to medical device company Becton, Dickinson as well as large cap pharmaceutical company\u00a0Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Johnson & Johnson recently spun out its consumer health care business, becoming a more focused yet broadly diversified pharmaceutical and medtech company.\u201d\n\n6. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 88\n\nDespite weak earnings posted in December 2023, Oracle is one of the least shorted stocks to buy according to hedge funds. As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 88 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL).\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cOracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a disappointing second quarter due to supply constraints. Cloud revenue was below expectations as Oracle made planning decisions to accommodate some large-scale Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) clients that take longer to bring online. We continue to believe that Oracle has a unique position in Generative AI workloads and continue to like its position and strategy.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now 13 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a015 Best Least Shorted Stocks to Buy Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Savvy investors are shifting their focus towards meme stocks to sell, adapting to the stock market\u2019s changing trends where meme stocks have fallen out of favor. The trend, fueled by social media, morphed low-quality stocks into overnight sensations, spurring short-lived surges in value as online communities banded together. However, the excitement surrounding these stocks often masks the risks involved with such investments, making it imperative to scrutinize these volatile assets.\n\nAs the allure of meme stocks wanes, those that once dominated headlines now flounder, shedding most of their gains. Driven more by hype than solid fundamentals, these stocks present mostly perilous ventures. Therefore, investors need to be cautious and prioritize long-term stability over the fleeting gains of meme stocks. With that said, here are seven unattractive meme stocks bets likely to erode shareholder value further.\n\nMeme Stocks to Sell: AMC Entertainment (AMC) In this photo illustration the stock market information of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. displays on a smartphone while the logo of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. APE stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nRenowned movie theatre chain, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), faces an uphill battle. Over the past year, its shares plummeted by roughly 90%. Moreover, this downturn is further exacerbated by a massive debt load of $9.32 billion. Adding to AMC\u2019s predicament, external challenges such as the Hollywood writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes have pushed project timelines further out, casting a shadow over AMC\u2019s prospects for 2024 and beyond.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, the market responded unfavorably to AMC\u2019s strategic moves, evidenced by a 30% stock price drop following the announcement to sell up to 40 million new shares in September 2023. Additionally, AMC\u2019s efforts to reduce these challenges and its debt through debt-for-equity swaps have resulted in more shareholder dilution, increasing analyst skepticism over its future. Consequently, Quant analysts assign a \u2018strong sell,\u2019 rating to AMC stock, underscoring its challenging recovery path.\n\nStory continues\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning light\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisuals\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME), a top retailer in video games and gear, is navigating a rough terrain. Its share price is down more than 34.6% in the past year, a worrying drop in value. The company\u2019s challenges are amplified by market volatility, tied to speculative trading on online platforms and social media. Such exposure has caused its stock price to fluctuate wildly, largely driven by conversations on forums such as Reddit.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, GameStop\u2019s revenue fell to $1.08 billion, a 9.11% drop, missing expectations by $103.92 million. This downturn is part of a broader trend, with total assets decreasing by 5.29% and free cash plummeting by 99.24%, underscoring the company\u2019s financial distress.\n\nFurthermore, TipRanks analysts aren\u2019t optimistic, assigning GME stock a \u2018moderate sell\u2019 rating and forecasting a potential downside of 57.51%. Hence, this grim outlook and the company\u2019s current market position suggest a bleak future for investors.\n\nMullen Automotive (MULN) Mullen Automotive offers superior, technologically advanced electric vehicles. Their premium quality EVs pioneer a sustainable, eco-friendly future. MULN stock\n\nSource: MacroEcon / Shutterstock.com\n\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN), an electric vehicle maker, reported a staggering $1 billion loss last year, with its stock plummeting 99.8%.\n\nDespite delivering 231 vehicles worth $11.9 million in the fourth quarter, Mullen hasn\u2019t recognized any revenue. Moreover, the company is struggling to build momentum as it continues to burn cash at an alarming pace each quarter. Its return on common equity at a negative 960% is indicative of its financial woes, likely to weigh down its future prospects.\n\nWith the CEO announcing in December 2023 the need to raise capital in 2024 to fund operations until becoming cash flow positive, Mullen\u2019s future looks bleak. Given the abundance of better investment opportunities in the EV sphere, it\u2019s best to steer clear of this stock at this time.\n\nCarvana (CVNA) Gaithersburg MD June 26, 2021 Carvana (CVNA) Auto Dealership\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarvana (NYSE:CVNA), once celebrated as a pandemic success, is now in a major spot of bother, with its stock still more than 85% below its peak despite a 380.6% rally over the past year. This stark contrast underscores the auto retailer\u2019s rollercoaster journey, now plagued by consecutive unprofitable quarters.\n\nThe excitement of being initially hailed as a tech titan has dwindled as reality sets in, with revenue growth plunging to negative 23% year-over-year (YOY), starkly underperforming the sector\u2019s median at 5.2%. Moreover, CVNA\u2019s future appears bleak, with forward revenue growth projected at negative 4% amidst a broader market slowdown. Its latest quarterly earnings reflects this downturn, where revenue fell 18.10% YOY to $2.77 billion.\n\nCompounding Carvana\u2019s woes is the declining auto market, particularly for used cars, where prices and demand are dwindling at a worrying pace. This trend will likely further impact Carvana\u2019s top and bottom-line results, suggesting that the road ahead is fraught with challenges.\n\nMeme stocks to sell: Nikola Corp (NKLA) Nikola (NKLA) company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock.com\n\nNikola Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) is now grappling with a stark downturn. The company\u2019s struggle to maintain its stock above the critical $1 threshold has led to another NASDAQ warning, hinting at a possible delisting. This decline is closely tied to the fall of its founder, Trevor Milton, who faces significant legal challenges, including securities and wire fraud charges.\n\nThe firm\u2019s woes deepened last year when it halted the production of its Tre battery-electric trucks due to fire risk in the battery packs, indicating severe operational setbacks. This stoppage, expected to extend into this year, underscores the severity of Nikola\u2019s challenges.\n\nAmid these struggles, Nikola\u2019s market position has rapidly deteriorated, with its stock plummeting 70% over the past year. A disappointing third-quarter report deepens the concern, showing a Non-GAAP earnings-per-share (EPS) loss of 30 cents, 16 cents below expectations, and a negative $1.73 million revenue shortfall. These figures highlight the grim reality facing Nikola as it navigates through a turbulent period.\n\nFaze Holdings (FAZE) Counter Strike: Global Offensive esports event. Main stage with a big screen and team FAZE clan logo.\n\nSource: Roman Kosolapov / Shutterstock.com\n\nFaze Holdings (NASDAQ:FAZE) is a popular esports business that has witnessed significant volatility, with its stock plummeting more than 72.5% over the past year. The firm\u2019s struggles stem from a misalignment between its business management and the ethos that originally fueled its fame. It lead to key members departing to become individual influencers, eroding its market value. Compounding these challenges, allegations of involvement in crypto scandals have further dented FAZE\u2019s credibility.\n\nFinancial indicators reflect FAZE\u2019s diminishing position, with YOY sales growth down by 10.7% and gross profit plunging by 84.8%. Additionally, net income dropped a staggering 94.5%, underscoring its precarious financial position. The combination of internal misalignments, controversy, and stark financial downturns underscores a period of major uncertainty for the company. With such instability, the company\u2019s path forward appears fraught with challenges, signaling caution for investors.\n\nBlackberry (BB)\n\nSource: BlackBerry\n\nTransitioning from a phone manufacturer to a cybersecurity and IoT firm did little to prevent BlackBerry\u2019s (NYSE:BB) decline. Its share price went down 45.21% over the past year. The drop was driven not just by a decrease in market interest in risky investments but also by the company\u2019s financial setbacks, including missing revenue targets by $5.8 million and a quarterly net loss that ballooned by 425%.\n\nThe company is struggling to turn around its fortunes, pushing towards positive cash flow through cost-cutting and margin expansion efforts. Despite these initiatives and reducing its debt by more than 40%, it\u2019s under major duress with regard to financial visibility and ability to secure financing. Additionally, BlackBerry\u2019s aggressive downsizing, including laying off employees and exiting global office locations, reflects its desperate measures to stabilize finances.\n\nFurthermore, Quant analysts have cast a pall over BB\u2019s prospects, tagging it with a \u2018strong sell\u2019 rating. The convergence of disappointing financial performance and investor skepticism paints a grim future for BlackBerry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "In the beginning, meme stocks to buy pitted the bulls against the bears. The market was without form and void of the knowledge of social media. That is until the hedge funds fooled around and found out.\n\nHowever, those days seem to be long gone. Sure, you will always find people willing to speculate on popular, social-media-driven enterprises. But the zenith of the wild movement appears to be firmly in the rearview mirror. Still, that\u2019s not going to stop folks from trying to get something going.\n\nIf I\u2019ve learned from my interactions with ardent proponents of meme stocks, it\u2019s this: appealing to reason isn\u2019t usually the most productive endeavor. It comes down to the reality that people want what they want. So, if you want meme stocks, let\u2019s have at it with the true classics.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New York\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it may be sexy to go contrarian with meme stocks, when analysts tell you to run from an enterprise, you probably should. That\u2019s the case with cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC). While I benefited in the past from AMC stock, I no longer own any shares. Frankly, I\u2019m glad that I got out of it given the severe deterioration of market value. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped the speculation.\n\nSo, could AMC make another magical run higher? First, I believe we must acknowledge the ardent support that the cineplex specialist attracts. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything like it so you can\u2019t count it out. Second, the bears appear to be betting against the enterprise, which theoretically could spark a short squeeze. For example, AMC\u2019s short interest comes in at 9.62% of its float, which is elevated.\n\nHowever, the bigger catalyst may come from the derivatives market. Fintel\u2019s options flow shows heavy volume of sold calls. At face value, these are bets that the underlying security won\u2019t rise above the listed strike price.\n\nFurther, some of these short calls \u2013 such as the Feb. 6 transaction for the Feb 23 \u201924 4.50 Call \u2013 show huge discrepancies between high volume and relatively low open interest. That could mean an aggressively bearish (perhaps naked?) short call. If so, it\u2019s off to the races but this is also an extremely risky bet.\n\nStory continues\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson\n\nSource: Brian Friedman / Shutterstock.com\n\nWithin the past six months, spaceflight specialist Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) has been all over the map. From August through late October, SPCE tumbled badly. However, from October to late December, SPCE managed to close near the $3 level. That signaled that the bulls have taken control of the market. Alas, it was a trap. Since the beginning of the new year, SPCE cratered, down about 26%.\n\nFundamentally, though, Virgin Galactic \u2013 all other things being equal \u2013 enjoys a burgeoning total addressable market. For instance, Spherical Insights reports that the global space exploration market size reached a valuation of $486 billion in 2022. By 2032, the sector could hit nearly $1.88 trillion. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.21%.\n\nAnd that adds some \u201ccredibility\u201d if you will to SPCE\u2019s short-squeeze prospects. Right now, its short interest as a percentage of float stands at 22.18%. Also, its short interest ratio lands at 11.72 days to cover. On the options flow side, bears have placed both short and long-expiry sold calls and bought puts.\n\nTo be blunt, I\u2019m not a big fan of SPCE\u2019s wildness. Still, if you have the nerve, it could be one of the meme stocks to buy.\n\nGameStop (GME) GameStop (GME) logo in front of stock market price graph\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is the one that started it all and coincidentally one of the few meme stocks to buy that I have in my portfolio. At first, GameStop (NYSE:GME) was like any other brick-and-mortar retailer fading away in the swamp of American open-air shopping centers. However, with competition moving in via e-commerce outlets combined with gaming console manufacturers facilitating direct-buy opportunities, GameStop days appeared to be numbered.\n\nStill, that was before short squeezes became part of the mainstream lexicon. I suppose that\u2019s the enduring legacy of GME. We as a financial publication industry routinely cover short squeezes. Heck, I even use short squeezes in my personal options trading. And the phenomenon is so powerful \u2013 that is forcing the bears to cover their positions \u2013 that even when you make an administrative mistake, the squeeze can potentially bail you out.\n\nCan the same happen again for GME? I wouldn\u2019t count it out. Fintel shows that its short interest as a percentage of float clocks in at 22.49%. Also, its short interest ratio stand at 22.17 days to cover. Recently, bearish traders have sold GME calls that expire on Feb. 16.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s shorting activities going on in both the open and derivatives markets, all it takes is a push in the \u201cright\u201d direction. Is it one of the meme stocks to buy? Ya know, it very well could be.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in GME.
