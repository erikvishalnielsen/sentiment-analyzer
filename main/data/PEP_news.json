        "title": "Why Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio favor junk food stocks",
        "content": "Billionaires have long capitalized on America's love for convenient snacks and guilty pleasures. Stocks offering consumable dopamine hits feature prominently in portfolios from Warren Buffett to Bill Gates and Ray Dalio.\n\nWhile it's easy to attribute gains in soda and fast-food stocks to unhealthy consumer habits\u2014potentially threatened by the latest weight-loss drugs\u2014analysts say these brands' diversification into healthier options will sustain them in an Ozempic-era future.\n\nWarren Buffett exemplifies the patriotic culinary investor. The 93-year-old famously loves McDonald's and Coca-Cola, often serving their products at meetings. He invests in both through Berkshire Hathaway or its subsidiaries.\n\nThe foundation of Bill Gates follows a similar investment strategy\u2014despite the tech titan being famously astonished by Buffett's diet. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Q1 2024 filing shows holdings of $604 million in Coca-Cola shares and nearly $97 million in Kraft Heinz, the maker of Kraft mac and cheese and Jell-O.\n\nRay Dalio's Bridgewater Associates also holds significant investments in Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Starbucks.\n\nHowever, these sweet treat stocks haven't performed in line with the rest of the market in recent years. At the time of writing, the S&P500 is up 83% in the past five years, while Coca-Cola and McDonald's are up 20% and PepsiCo is up around 30%.\n\nSo why have these illustrious portfolios hung on instead of investing in the wider market? The answer lies not in the good news but in the bad, points out Fillipo Falorni, Citi Research's lead analyst for U.S. beverages, household products, and personal care.\n\nFalorni highlights that in years like the 2008 financial crisis, when the S&P500 tanked around 40%, McDonald's share price stayed relatively the same. Likewise, Coca-Cola's share price dropped 25% while the Nasdaq fell 33%.\n\n\"The past five years had generally very solid macroeconomic conditions with a few exceptions (e.g. the COVID period),\" Falorni told Fortune. \"If you look at the performance during the Great Financial Crisis you will see that consumer staples stocks (including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, etc) outperformed the S&P 500.\"\n\nWith this in mind, it's easy to argue that it comes as no surprise that America's billionaires would be invested in stocks that are dependable in a crisis.\n\nBut the fact also begs the question of why so many companies that offer an accessible treat dominate the Fortune 500, while behemoth salad brands are somewhat more scarce.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analysts Fortune spoke to said these companies quietly dominating Wall Street are no coincidence.\n\nThe reason for their success\u2014and why these stocks will likely continue to perform\u2014is that they're trading on something that sets them apart from other buzzy stock alternatives on the S&P500.\n\nWhat AI can't replicate is the dopamine rush of the first swig of coffee in the morning, the bite of a burger after a long day at work, or the fizz of a can of soda opening.\n\nHuge emerging markets opportunity for growth\n\nFor Falorni the attraction of 'sweet treat' stocks today isn't derived from where the companies have grown from but where they're going.\n\nIn a 2022 report, for example, Coca-Cola highlighted that in developed markets, only 32% of beverages are non-commercial\u2014basically tap water that is consumed at home. The rest of the market is alcohol, hot beverages and cold drinks like bottled water and fizzy drinks.\n\nThis statistic flips in developing and emerging markets, where 69% of drinks consumed are tap water, with just 16% of the market enjoying cold beverages.\n\nThis, combined with the fact that the populations in these countries are expected to grow faster than their developed peers, presents a large opportunity.\n\nPepsiCo\u2014which makes products from chips to fizzy drinks\u2014said that while volumes dropped in North America, sales were up 9% in emerging markets (which now represent about 40% of the brand's net revenue) such as Mexico and Brazil.\n\nLikewise,\u00a0Coca-Cola highlights that while its retail value in the likes of Latin America (~$120 billion) is smaller than in North America (~$325 million), the number of consumers it has in the former is much larger (~325 million consumers vs ~530 million consumers).\n\n\"Every given year, if they can convert 1% or less of the population from non-commercial to commercial beverages, that's a very long-term tailwind,\" Falorni explained.\n\nPatriotic nostalgia for consumers\n\nWhile Falorni agrees there may be an element of \"recognition bias\" for American investors, the fundamentals of the business hold far more sway.\n\nOn this, he adds: \"My view is these are very stable companies\u2026 to me, they have demonstrated over decades that they have been able to continue to grow regardless of the macro environment and consumer preference shifts.\"\n\nHowever, according to Pat Tschosik, senior portfolio strategist at Ned Davis Research, the lure of McDonald's and KFC does have an element of patriotic nostalgia for consumers.\n\nWhile Tschosik believes the consumer staples market as a whole has not performed as well as others\u2014citing that on a total return basis, the sector has performed at an annualized return of 10.5% compared to the S&P 500's 10.7% over the past 30 years\u2014he told Fortune: \"You know exactly what you are going to get when you order chicken nuggets from McDonalds, open a Hershey bar, a can of Coke, and order a caramel\u00a0macchiato from Starbucks.\n\n\"The U.S. has built so many iconic brands and restaurants that have stood the test of selling everywhere in the world. I believe taste, convenience, consistency of product, and building up of brand image is key and what American food and beverage companies do\u00a0exceptionally\u00a0well.\"\n\nIs the Ozempic effect overblown?\n\nThe biggest current concern for snack and fast food giants is, of course, weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nConcerns that these medications could wipe billions of value off the snack industry isn't unfounded\u2014the likes of Walmart, PepsiCo and Nestle have already briefed analysts on the effects that the GLP-1s will have on their businesses.\n\nBut while it's easy to assume companies that have historically been associated with unhealthy items would be concerned about these drugs, analysts say it has also opened up an entirely new frontier of business.\n\n\"Consumer staples are called staples for a reason,\" Tschosik said. \"There will always be a need for 1) convenient, low-prep-time meals, snacks and beverages, and 2) treats, indulgences, and self-rewards that include caffeine and sugar. I do not believe\u00a0Ozempic,\u00a0and healthy alternatives\u00a0will ever destroy\u00a0these\u00a0demand\u00a0factors.\"\n\nFalorni is of the same opinion, pointing out that at any point in time there will be a portion of society who wants to lose weight. In the future, a larger portion of this group may choose to take Ozempic, but that doesn't mean more people in the wider population will begin taking the drug.\n\nIn addition, Citi research that analyzed 500 people taking GLP-1 drugs against 500 people using other weight loss methods found little difference between their levels of consumption.\n\nIndeed, the difference was so minimal\u2014when applied to a ratio in the coming decades of the total population expected to take GLP-1s\u2014the resulting drop in consumption is approximately a single point per year.\n\nThis factor, combined with the fact some users may not want to undergo an injectable treatment\u2014led the analyst to be largely undaunted by the phenomenon.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): Is This FMCG Stock Worth Buying Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best FMCG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other FMCG stocks.\n\nIf you walk into a modern pantry, you're almost guaranteed to find it well-stocked with everyday essentials like toilet paper, soap and toothpaste, beverages, and food. This reflects a simple reality: most consumers prefer to keep these items in ample supply. While consumers will always demand these products, they are not entirely indifferent to price increases during inflation. Instead, they might look to save money by buying in bulk or shopping at big-box stores. Regardless, they will continue to prioritize purchasing these necessities.\n\nKnown as fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) or consumer packaged goods (CPG), these high-demand products are valued for their affordability and rapid turnover. They are considered \"fast-moving\" because they quickly sell off store shelves due to their regular use by consumers. Although investors typically look towards bonds and cash to manage risk, FMCG stocks offer a defensive alternative that can provide both growth and income. While these stocks may not generate spectacular growth opportunities and can lose value as interest rates rise, they generally decline less than other sectors during recessions. In fact, certain industries, such as food, tobacco, and alcohol, may even experience increased demand during economic downturns. As one of the world's largest industries, the global FMCG sector has seen steady growth over the past decade, driven by the trend of experiential retailing, where shopping is viewed as a social activity. The global FMCG market is projected to reach $18,939.4 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% from 2022 to 2031.\n\nFollowing low deal volume and value in 2020, the consumer goods landscape saw a significant shift in M&A activity. In 2021, as sizable assets in the sector became scarce and prohibitively expensive, companies strategically moved toward a higher-volume, lower-deal-value approach. According to McKinsey, this trend peaked in 2021 with around 470 consumer goods deals globally. The distribution of M&A activity varied across subsectors regarding volume and value. Food remained the largest category by deal volume, accounting for about 40%, while beverages and durables together made up an additional 30%. On the other hand, in terms of deal value, personal care led the pack with 38%, primarily driven by large spin-offs of pharmaceutical companies' consumer businesses. A notable example includes Johnson & Johnson's $42 billion spin-off of Kenvue last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of late May, several major retailers have reported their Q1 2024 earnings, offering valuable insights into the current state of the U.S. consumer's sentiments. With consumer spending accounting for approximately 70% of the U.S. economy, shifts in spending patterns significantly impact growth and employment. Walmart, for example, observed changes in customer behavior, with CFO John Rainey noting in the company's Q1 earnings call:\n\n\"Many consumer pocketbooks are still stretched, and we see the effect of that in our business mix as they're spending more of their paychecks on non-discretionary categories and less on general merchandise. This merchandise mix remains a headwind to margins, but it\u2019s consistent with our expectations.\"\n\nThis indicates that consumers are prioritizing essential groceries over discretionary items like televisions. Walmart's earnings suggest that while overall consumer spending remains steady, those with less disposable income are struggling and continue to seek value in their purchases. In any case, despite inflation and challenging market conditions, people still need to eat and buy essentials, making FMCG stocks more resilient compared to other sectors in the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nAfter a comprehensive analysis of FMCG stocks listed on NYSE and NASDAQ using ETFs and internet rankings, we have curated a selection of the 14 top FMCG stocks to buy now according to hedge fuds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), headquartered in Purchase, New York, is a leading American multinational corporation in the food, snack, and beverage industry. Notably, PepsiCo\u2019s shares have exhibited significant growth, rising approximately 23.05% over the past five years. Known for its robust financial foundation, PepsiCo has impressively increased its dividends for 51 consecutive years. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share, resulting in a yield of 3.32%.\n\nOn May 16, Jefferies updated its outlook on PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shares, raising the price target from $209 to $211 while maintaining a Buy rating. The firm noted that after acquiring its US bottlers, PepsiCo's North America Beverages (PBNA) segment margins initially stood at 18% but have since declined to 11%. Jefferies' report highlights several factors that could lead to improved PBNA margins, including a revamped product portfolio, a larger asset base, and reduced capital expenditure. Additionally, stable input costs are expected to support margin improvement.\n\nBy the end of Q1 2024, 62 hedge funds included PepsiCo, Inc.

        "title": "Coca-Cola Just Agreed With Pepsi and McDonald's About the Economy. Here's What It Could Mean for Investors.",
        "content": "Last month, fast-food giant  McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) started combating slumping sales with the launch of a $5 value meal. And the plan appears to be working.\n\nFor context, in the first quarter of 2024, same-store sales for McDonald's were up less than 2% year over year. But the company had raised prices, which helped to boost the nominal sales figures. In contrast, management noted declining traffic across the entire quick-service restaurant space.\n\nPeople are looking for value, according to McDonald's, which is why it came out with its limited-time $5 meal last month. But 93% of the company's restaurant locations just voted to keep the bargain offer going, according to CNBC.\n\nMcDonald's isn't the only company with its finger on the macro-economic pulse. Other enormous food companies such as PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) agree with the assessment from management. The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) just added its supporting commentary as well. Here's what I believe it all means for investors.\n\nWhat's going on with American consumers?\n\nOn July 23, Coca-Cola reported financial results for its second quarter of 2024, showing a modest increase in product volume. In other words, revenue was up not only because its prices were a little higher; people also bought more products. This was encouraging.\n\nHowever, Coca-Cola's unit case volume was up everywhere except in North America, where volume fell 1% year over year. And Pepsi agrees that there are headwinds in North America and specifically in the U.S. market. In the earnings call to discuss financial results for Q2 2024, CEO Ramon Laguarta said: \"In the U.S., there is clearly a consumer that...want[s] more value to stay with our brands.\"\n\nLaguarta went on to say: \"This need for value or more value consciousness, I think, is impacting every household in the U.S.\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski agreed by saying: \"All income cohorts are seeking value.\" In other words, everyone is feeling the pinch and wanting to save some money.\n\nTherefore, it appears that after years of prices climbing higher and higher, American consumers are finally pushing back, looking for bargains instead of accepting the rising sticker prices.\n\nPushing back against higher prices\n\nFor more mature businesses, true growth is generally hard to come by. In recent years, the top-line numbers for companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi have benefited from higher prices due to inflation. But it's also possible that some businesses got a little greedy -- profit margins have surged, suggesting prices went up more than expenses.\n\nStory continues\n\nTake Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG) as an example. In 2019 (the final full year before the pandemic and subsequent inflation), the company had a respectable profit margin of 6.3%. In 2023, it had a profit margin of 12.5% -- almost a clean doubling. It would appear that it responded to inflation by raising menu prices far more than it needed to, boosting profits. Chipotle isn't the only example of this, but it's perhaps one of the clearest examples.\n\nConsumers aren't the only ones pushing back. European grocery chain Carrefour pulled Pepsi products from its shelves earlier this year, complaining about the higher prices.\n\nNow that they're facing pushback, some businesses are accepting the reality that prices need to come down. This is a risk to both revenue and profit margins.\n\nThe $5 deal from McDonald's is an example here. Some investors likely believe it's a profitable venture, since 93% of restaurants just voted to keep the deal going. But that's only partly true. It's likely that the economics of the deal aren't great. But Coca-Cola is pitching in to make it more economically viable.\n\nIn Q2, Coca-Cola's CEO James Quincey said: \"We're partnering with foodservice customers to market food and drink combo meals to drive traffic and beverage incidents.\" The beverage giant is doing this for the same reason as McDonald's: It would rather lower prices than risk losing sales. But these sales could come at more normalized profit margins.\n\nWhat it means for investors now\n\nIn recent years, investors have favored large, \"safe\" stocks such as Coca-Cola or McDonald's. And they've been rewarded. These companies have raised prices, boosting revenues. In some cases, they've raised prices to the point of boosting profit margins.\n\nHowever, it seems that people have reached their limit, which could motivate these businesses to lower prices or at least keep prices in place for a while. This could affect revenue and profit margins, and these so-called safe stocks might be stuck in neutral in coming years.\n\nIn my opinion, finding companies that have true long-term growth prospects and profit-margin expansion is as important now as ever. Coca-Cola and McDonald's likely can't deliver on those things for investors today. Pepsi's growth will likely be modest, but it does have room to grow profits thanks to the greater scale of certain business segments in international markets, specifically its snacking business in Latin America.\n\nTherefore, Pepsi is likely a better buy from here compared to Coca-Cola or McDonald's. But the takeaway is that investors should be looking for opportunities with growth and profits, recognizing that those two things will be harder to come by for many mature, established businesses.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Coca-Cola wasn\u2019t one of them.

While the quarterly EPS beat the consensus estimates, revenues came in slightly lower than expected.\n\n\"During the second quarter, our business delivered net revenue growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and double-digit EPS growth, remaining agile despite facing difficult net revenue growth comparisons versus the prior year, subdued category performance within North America convenient foods and the impacts associated with certain product recalls at Quaker Foods North America,\" said Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta.\n\nFollowing the revenue miss, several analysts cut their price targets on PepsiCo, as reviewed in this Benzinga article.\n\nFlowers Foods\n\nFlowers Foods Inc. (NYSE:FLO) produces and markets packaged bakery food products in the United States. The company distributes its products, which include fresh bread, buns, rolls, snack cakes, and tortillas, through a direct-store delivery system and a warehouse delivery system and operates bakeries. The key brands are Nature's Own, Whitewheat, Cobblestone Bread, Wonder, Dave's Killer Bread, Canyon Bakehouse, Mrs. Freshley's, and Tastykake.\n\nStory continues\n\nFlowers Foods paid dividends consecutively for 87 years and increased them consistently for the last 10 years.\n\nAccording to the company's most recent dividend announcement on May 23, it hiked the quarterly dividend by 4.3% to $0.24 per share, equal to $0.96 annually. Currently, the company's dividend yield is 4.36%.\n\nFlowers Foods' annual revenue (as of March 31) is $5.1 billion. The company is scheduled to report its Q2 2024 earnings on August 8. Consensus estimates currently stand at $1.24 billion and $0.33 for revenue and EPS, respectively.\n\nLike Flower Foods, these two underrated dividend stocks offer high yields.\n\nDon\u2019t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nFidelity National Financial\n\nFidelity National Financial Inc. (NYSE:FNF) offers various insurance products in the United States. It offers title insurance, escrow, and other title-related services, including trust activities, trustee sales guarantees, recordings and reconveyances, and home warranty products.\n\nFidelity National Financial raised its dividends every year for the last 13 years. Its most recently announced dividend increase was at the end of last year. According to the company's news release on Nov. 7, 2023, its Board of Directors hiked the quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.48 per common share, or $1.92 annualized, with a yield of 3.61%.\n\nAs of March 31, the company's annual revenue stood at $12.3 billion. As per the company's most recent earnings report, released on May 8, it generated revenues of $3.30 billion and EPS of $0.76 in Q1 2024.\n\n\u201cTogether, our businesses delivered a 36% increase in adjusted net earnings over the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, we will prudently manage the Company and maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on growing our business through attractive acquisitions while maintaining a steady return of capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend as we await the eventual turn in residential purchase volumes,\" said William P. Foley, II, Chairman of Fidelity National Financial.\n\nIts upcoming quarterly earnings report is scheduled for Aug. 5, with Wall Street analysts expecting an EPS/revenue of $1.31/$3.2 billion.\n\nTo summarize, PepsiCo, Flowers Foods, and Fidelity National Financial are solid investment choices for investors seeking reliable passive income. The offered yields of around 3-4%, combined with their long history of consistent dividend payments and hikes, make them particularly attractive to income-focused investors.\n\nAre You Missing Out On Higher Yields?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "content": "$1,000 A Week In Dividends, Redditor Shares Passive Income Secrets\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nMany people dream of earning a steady income from dividends, whether they are looking to retire early or supplement their existing income and grow wealth. Reaching specific benchmarks indicates that you are headed in the right direction. One Redditor posting on the \"Dividends\" forum shared how they have managed to amass a portfolio that will earn $1,000 a week in dividends. The takeaways are simple but valuable for any dividend investor.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret. Don\u2019t miss out: earn 8-15% expected returns by investing in fractional real estate. Get started with only $10.\n\nDividend investing isn't like some of the other investing disciplines. It requires a lot of patience and a steady allocation of capital to reach your goals. In this case, the Redditor has been working on the portfolio for 15 years, steadily adding along the way and reinvesting dividends received until the portfolio was close to the magic million-dollar mark. The 49-year-old Redditor has a plan to reach $125,000 in yield from this portfolio and other investments by the end of 2025 in order not to have to touch the principal after retirement.\n\nIt Doesn't Have To Be All High Yield\n\nYou don't always need high-yielding stocks to significantly impact your portfolio over time. The Redditor posted a portfolio showing a yield of 5.61%. While that is a healthy yield, the Redditor posted that the portfolio is a mix of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks and that nothing is more than 7% of the total. They highlighted three specific stocks.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has a forward dividend yield of 2.99% and an annual dividend payout of $1.94. Because of its modest payout, it would take a substantial outlay of over $40,000 to earn even $100 a month in dividend income. In this case, steadiness is a virtue; the company is a dividend aristocrat who has paid out steadily over time. Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and raised guidance. CEO James Quincey noted, \u201cConsumer sentiment in the aggregate is pretty strong, pretty resilient.\"\n\nAnother dividend aristocrat, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), has a forward dividend yield of 3.26% and an annual dividend payout of $5.42. Like Coca-Cola, Pepsi is very tied to consumer spending habits. However, it has additional exposure to the snacks and prepared foods market through its Quaker Oats and Frito-Lay divisions. After the most recent earnings showed signs of a slowdown in snacking habits, the company plans to reevaluate its pricing and debut new tastes and flavors designed to get people excited about its products again.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\n\nPopular fast-food chain Wendy's (WEN) has a higher forward dividend yield than the two mentioned above, coming in at 5.97%, but with an annual payout of only $1.00. Goldman Sachs analyst Christine Cho recently called Wendy's a \u2018show-me' story because it has made minimal inroads on its push into better breakfast sales. The company recently announced that it is selling its Honey Buddy honey chicken biscuit for $1 during morning hours.\n\nThe Redditor also relies on various ETFs, including the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI), which has a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 7.98%. It has 135 holdings, a mix of technology, financial services, and consumer goods companies. The portfolio also has exposure to the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPQ), which aims to provide monthly distributable income and Nasdaq 100 exposure with less volatility. It currently has 99 stocks and is heavily weighted toward Big Tech companies, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWhile we can't know a person's entire portfolio from a single Reddit post, a well-thought-out dividend strategy can significantly help build wealth over time. A mixture of reliable dividend payers and ETFs for a broader exposure range can yield substantial gains for patient investors.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.

        "title": "Spicy dispute over the origins of Flamin' Hot Cheetos winds up in court",
        "content": "A court case could soon settle a spicy dispute: Who invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos?\n\nA former PepsiCo executive is suing the company, saying it destroyed his career after questioning his claim that he invented the popular flavor of Cheetos snacks.\n\nPepsiCo said Thursday it has no comment on the lawsuit, which was filed July 18 in California Superior Court.\n\nAccording to his lawsuit, Richard Montanez began working for PepsiCo as a janitor at its Frito-Lay plant in Ranch Cucamonga, California, in 1977. Montanez was the son of a Mexican immigrant and grew up in a migrant labor camp.\n\nOne day, a machine in Montanez\u2019s plant broke down, leaving a batch of unflavored Cheetos. Montanez says he took the batch home and dusted them with chili powder, trying to replicate the flavor of elote, the popular grilled seasoned corn served in Mexico.\n\nIn 1991, Montanez asked for a meeting with PepsiCo CEO Roger Enrico to pitch his spicy Cheetos, confident they would be a hit with the Latino community. Enrico granted the meeting, liked the presentation and directed the company to develop spicy Cheetos, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMontanez said PepsiCo sent him on speaking engagements and actively promoted his story. But in the meantime, Montanez claims the company\u2019s research and development department shut him out of its discussions and testing.\n\nPepsiCo introduced Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos in 1992. Montanez says he continued to develop spicy snacks, like Flamin\u2019 Hot Popcorn and Lime and Chili Fritos, and in 2000 he was promoted to a business development manager in Southern California. Montanez eventually became PepsiCo\u2019s vice president of multicultural marketing and sales.\n\nMontanez said demand for speaking engagements was so great that he retired from PepsiCo in 2019 to become a motivational speaker full time. He published a memoir in 2021 and his life story was made into a movie, \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot,\u201d in 2023.\n\nBut according to the lawsuit, PepsiCo turned on Montanez in 2021, cooperating with a Los Angeles Times piece that claimed others in the company were already working on spicy snacks when Montanez approached them, and that they \u2013 not Montanez \u2013 came up with the name, \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot.\u201d\n\nMontanez said PepsiCo\u2019s about-face has hurt his speaking career and other potential opportunities, including a documentary about his life.\n\nHe is seeking damages for discrimination, fraud and defamation, among other charges.\n\nView comments",

The economy\u2019s main growth engine \u2014 personal spending \u2014 rose 2.3%, also more than forecast.\n\nA closely watched measure of underlying inflation rose 2.9%, easing from the first quarter but still above forecast, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed Thursday.\n\nEven though the pace of growth picked up from the first quarter, the figures still represent a moderation from last year. Consumer spending and broader economic activity have cooled under the weight of high interest rates, which is simultaneously helping to tame inflation gradually.\n\nThat bodes well for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to pull off a soft landing for the economy and likely to start cutting interest rates as soon as September. However, it\u2019ll be a fine balance to cool the labor market just enough without putting millions of people out of work, especially as unemployment has now risen for three straight months.\n\nTreasury yields rose slightly and stock futures fluctuated after the report. Policymakers weren\u2019t expected to cut rates when they meet next week.\n\nGrowth Breakdown\n\nConsumer spending was driven mostly by a rebound in durable goods like cars and furnishings as well as a more moderate advance in services outlays compared to the first quarter, according to the GDP report.\n\nGovernment spending contributed more to GDP compared to the first three months of the year, boosted by defense spending. Residential investment subtracted from growth for the first time in a year as high mortgage rates kept a lid on sales activity and new construction.\n\nBusiness investment grew at the fastest pace in almost a year, led by the strongest advance in equipment since the start of 2022. A separate report Thursday showed orders placed with US factories for business equipment, excluding aircraft and defense, increased in June by the most since early last year.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this food and beverage company have returned +0.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share, indicating a change of +3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.15 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.77 indicates a change of +7.7% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $24.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.5%. The $93.98 billion and $98.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.7% and +4.5%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $22.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.8%. EPS of $2.28 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.25%. The EPS surprise was +6.05%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPepsiCo is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Coca-Cola: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "content": "It's not just one of the world's most iconic brand names: The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) has also been one of the world's most rewarding stocks. Oh, it's a slow mover to be sure. It's been a consistent winner for decades, though, with those gains augmented by lots of reliable dividend growth along the way. Plenty of investors have become millionaires by patiently holding onto their stakes in this company.\n\nCoca-Cola isn't the beverage sector's most rewarding long-term investment, however. That honor actually -- and quietly -- belongs to rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP).\n\nThat information can certainly catch investors off-guard. After all, Coca-Cola is the bigger player. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that PepsiCo could continue to be the better performer of the two.\n\nThe same, but different\n\nYes, they're both in the beverage business. And Coca-Cola is more than its namesake soda. It also owns brands such as Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid, Powerade, and Dasani water, just to name a few. PepsiCo, of course, owns the Pepsi brand, as well as Gatorade, Bubly Sparkling Water, and Mountain Dew, and is licensed to sell branded beverages from the likes of Starbucks and Lipton. PepsiCo is also parent to Quaker Oats and snack chip brand Frito-Lay, which owns Lay's, Doritos, Rold Gold, and others.\n\nThese aren't the two outfits' defining differences though. In fact, in terms of product lines and their target customers, the two companies are more alike than different -- even when including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay arm.\n\nAnd yet, the two stock's performances are strangely different.\n\nThe chart below tells the tale. Over the course of the past 50 years, PepsiCo shares have gained nearly three times as much as Coca-Cola shares. PEP Chart\n\nAnd that comparison is just of each stock's price change. Adding reinvested dividends to the mix, since 1994, PepsiCo shares boast an annualized return rate of 11% versus Coke's 8.7%.\n\nCredit their differing dividend growth rates for most of this sizable performance disparity. Although Coca-Cola has raised its payouts every year for the past 62 years, it has not raised them by as much as PepsiCo has for the past 20. PEP Dividend Chart\n\nLittle things like that -- and like a stronger stock-buyback program, as well -- add up to big things over time.\n\nLook for more of the same going forward, too, due to the differences in how each of these organizations is structured.\n\nWhy PepsiCo is outperforming Coca-Cola\n\nAs a consumer, you neither know nor likely care who's responsible for the physical process of bottling your beverages. As an investor though, you should understand that Coca-Cola probably didn't bottle the Coke-branded beverage you regularly enjoy. It outsources most of that work to licensed third-party bottlers that purchase concentrated flavored syrups from the company. This approach means that Coca-Cola brings in less overall revenue, but has higher profit margins on that revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast, PepsiCo handles the production of most of its products in-house. In fact, it's even a licensed manufacturer for rivals like Keurig Dr Pepper, monetizing equipment that would sometimes sit idle otherwise.\n\nThe difference has a clear impact on each outfit's profit margins. By offloading the risks and headaches of owning cost-intensive facilities and capital-intensive assets, Coca-Cola regularly turns nearly 30% of its revenue into net income versus PepsiCo's more modest net margin of only about 15%.\n\nYet there's more to the story, because Coca-Cola's business model leaves it reliant on partners that are trying to turn profits of their own. As such, they may not be focused on the same priorities that Coke targets.\n\nPepsiCo doesn't face this same sort of potential problem, though. While operating its own production facilities eats into margins, it also provides the company with complete control of the integrated operation, giving it more flexibility than Coca-Cola.\n\nThere's also the not-so-small matter of Coca-Cola's cost bloat. For a company that doesn't actually produce much, it's still huge, with lots of overhead, and steep personnel expenses in particular. Consider that nearly 40% of PepsiCo's revenue goes toward the selling, general, and administrative expenses of its integrated operation; Coca-Cola dishes out a little more than 30% of its revenue on that expense category even though its bottling partners handle the bulk of the production.\n\nLong live the difference\n\nNothing is etched in stone, of course. The Coca-Cola Company could evolve again, or PepsiCo could follow in its rival's footsteps, offloading production to third parties in an effort to widen its profit margins. It's also possible either or both companies could simply drop the ball and lose customers.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that even though PepsiCo stock has been the better overall performer, it's not like Coke has been a disaster. It's still been a great-performing ticker.\n\nThe details that make these two companies distinctly different, however, aren't the kind of nuances that quickly or readily change. That's why PepsiCo is apt to continue minting more millionaires than Coca-Cola.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Co-founding Partner ESPN, National Partner Gatorade and the Women's Sports Foundation (WSF\u00ae) honor 10 years of this powerful initiative by awarding a historic $500,000 to 50 community organizations supporting girls of color through sports.\n\nWNBA legend Sue Bird honors the Foundation's 50th anniversary with a special donation in partnership with CarMax to the Sports 4 Life program.\n\nNEW YORK, July 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0The Women's Sports Foundation (WSF) is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Sports 4 Life program by announcing the largest grant pool and class since the program's inception in 2014. This national initiative \u2013 co-founded by ESPN and supported by Gatorade \u2013 utilizes the power of sport to build a solid foundation for Black, African-American, Hispanic and Native American girls to thrive in sport and in life. Thanks to a special donation from Sue Bird in partnership with CarMax in honor of the Foundation's 50th anniversary and additional contributions from supporters, WSF is distributing a historic $500,000 via $10,000 grants to 50 organizations across 22 states, and Washington, D.C., helping fuel and diversify opportunities for more than 9,500 girls across 40 traditional, non-traditional, and adaptive sports.\n\nSports 4 Life embodies WSF's 50-year legacy as it has worked to build a more equitable future for girls both on and off the field of play, especially where disparities persist. WSF's latest research report, \"Thriving Through Sport: The Transformative Impact on Girls' Mental Health,\" illuminated that participating in supportive sport environments positively impacts girls' mental health, yet girls who identify as white are more likely to participate in sport than their non-white peers. The data clearly shows that getting more girls of color in the game is paramount to helping them live healthier, more enriched lives.\u00a0That is why WSF is proud to amplify that since inception, Sports 4 Life has funded 254 organizations across 40 states, Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands, providing $2.8 million in grants to nearly 90,000 girls participating in over 40 sports.\n\n\"For 50 years and counting, a simple belief has fueled our mission at the Women's Sports Foundation \u2013 when girls play, they lead and we all win,\" said WSF CEO Danette Leighton. \"The impact we have been able to make with this powerful initiative wouldn't be possible without the shared vision of our co-founding partner ESPN, the continued support of Gatorade, and thanks to this year's donation from Sue Bird and CarMax, we are able to celebrate its 10-year milestone by reaching even more girls in communities who lack sport access.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis year's grant recipients cover a gamut of traditional, non-traditional and adaptive sports opportunities for girls, including figure skating, flag football, and skateboarding. Thanks to Bird's contribution, five of the grants will go to community organizations who specialize in teaching basketball, a sport she built a legendary career in and continues to invest in today.\n\n\"Even if girls don't go on to become professional athletes, participating in sport at a young age helps build necessary skills that will benefit them throughout their lifetimes,\" said Bird. \"That's why I am proud to support WSF's Sports 4 Life program as it continues to eliminate barriers to sport for BIPOC girls, surrounding them with a community to learn from and be inspired by.\"\n\nThe program has had a profound impact on those who participate, particularly in perseverance, education and leadership. According to WSF's Communities at the Forefront report, which collected and analyzed data from Sports 4 Life grant recipients, 97% of girls agreed they would keep trying until they reached their goals, while 92%\u00a0said participating in their programs helped them get better grades. Furthermore, many reported that after a single season of participation, they were far more likely to be involved in leadership and community activities, compared to when they first entered the programs.\n\n\"ESPN is proud to celebrate 10 years of Sports 4 Life and its impact on young girls of color nationwide,\" said Kevin Martinez, vice president of ESPN Corporate Citizenship. \"When we created Sports 4 Life with the Women's Sports Foundation, we understood that girls of color were disproportionately excluded from opportunities to play sports. Today, we are proud of how innovative grant making is shifting the narrative, and we are committed to continue investing in young girls of color through Sports 4 Life so that they can enjoy the many benefits and gain leadership skills that come from playing sports.\"\n\nThirty-five of the 50 community organizations are new to Sports 4 Life funding, further expanding the reach of this powerful initiative. Helping girls of color play, compete and lead \u2013 in sports and beyond \u2013 for a decade, the program has had a generational impact with many of the participants from the inaugural class now holding leadership positions at the organizations who encouraged them to #KeepPlaying.

        "title": "Inflation drove prices higher at Coca-Cola, consumers still on the hunt for value: CEO",
        "content": "Coca-Cola (KO) held onto its momentum to deliver another bubbly quarter on Tuesday.\n\nThe soda giant beat Wall Street's estimates in Q2, led by global demand for its beverages, despite higher prices. Revenue grew 3% to $12.4 billion, compared to the expected $11.76 billion. Earnings per share came in 7% higher year over year at $0.84, compared to estimates of $0.81.\n\nOn a call with Yahoo Finance, CEO James Quincey said the results were a result of a \"a strong execution of the strategy.\" As a result, the company is raising its 2024 guidance.\n\n\"We're expressing a confidence in our ability to deliver on the 2024 guidance ... it's really a manifestation of confidence in our long term strategy to create brands and to be able to work with our bottling partners to execute them,\" he said.\n\nOverall, unit case volume jumped 2%, while pricing was up 9%. The company raised its full-year guidance and now expects organic revenue to grow 9% to 10%.\n\n\"You have to parse out a handful of countries that have very high inflation,\" like Argentina, Quincey said \"They are accounting for about half of the price mix.\" He said without that, price in dollars is up 4%.\n\nHe added that headline inflation in the US and Europe are getting to the 3% range, which reflects in Coca-Cola's numbers.\n\n\"Inflation...is getting into the kind of normalized space,\" he said.\n\nIn the previous quarter Q1, Coca-Cola reported $11.3 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street estimates of $10.96 billion, while its earnings per share of $0.72 also topped expectations of $0.70. A boy uses a vending machine at a Coca-Cola gas station refreshment center in Asheville, N.C. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)\n\nAs US consumers remain cautious about where they spend their dollars, fast food chains like McDonald's (MCD), Burger King (QSR), and Taco Bell (YUM) are hoping to entice consumers with value and meal deals this summer.\n\nCoca-Cola reportedly played a role in the $5 meal bundle at McDonald's, which is now extended to August. At the time, a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, \u201cWe routinely partner with our customers on marketing programs to meet consumer needs.\u201d\n\nQuincey said the company is still seeing the \"continuation of, essentially the lower income consumers, being under pressure.\"\n\n\"Wages are starting to run ahead of overall inflation, but interest rates are still relatively high, and so they're economizing to some extent.\"\n\nPer JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira, the lower-income consumer makes up about 20% of Coca-Cola's US volumes.\n\nConsumers are going to restaurant chains less, looking for value meals when they do, or trading down at grocery stores.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"That's a ongoing effect. I don't think it's got particularly worse or particularly better in the second quarter. I think it's still a feature of what's going on,\" Quincey said.\n\nCoca-Cola saw unit case volume decrease 1% in North America, as pricing jumped 11%.\n\nYear to date, shares are up 8%, lagging behind the S&P 500 (^GSPC) but far outperforming rival PepsiCo (PEP), whose shares are slightly down.\n\nPepsiCo reported earnings last week that beat estimates, but its US demand has weakened, Brian Sozzi reported.\n\nOn PepsiCo's earnings call, CEO Ramon Laguarta said, \"For many categories, the multiple-year inflation that we had to take because our input costs went up has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive. And consumers are making choices, and they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget.\"\n\nPer Coca-Cola's release, it gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages. Quincey said the team has spent a lot of time \"fine tuning strategies in terms of being a total beverage player,\" with the revitalization of the namesake Coke brand.\n\nWhen asked if Coca-Cola would ever stray away from solely beverages, Quincey said \"I rarely say never ... chances of us being something other than beverages are very low.\"\n\nThat could be a leg up in this consumer environment.\n\nPrior to the report, UBS analyst Peter Grom said weakness from consumers is \"largely concentrated on the convenient food side of the business rather than beverages.\"\n\nHere's what Coca-Cola reported in Q2, compared to Wall Streets' expectations per Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $12.4 billion versus $ 11.76 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.84 versus 0.81 Unit case volume growth: 2.00% versus 1.77%\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy on the Dip: July 2024",
        "content": "It\u2019s not just big tech stocks that have experienced a pullback lately. Many other highly-followed stocks have as well, including some of blue-chip stocks. Blue-chips may be known for their consistency and perceived lower levels of risks, but many investors have in recent months become fairly cautious about many names in this category.\n\nIn some cases, concerns have to do with valuation. Although the Federal Reserve is still expected to begin lowering interest rates later this year, some valuation-conscious investors are worried that specific blue-chips are becoming overvalued relative to long-term growth, and have trimmed exposure to them accordingly.\n\nIn other cases, concerns have more to do with sector or company-specific headwinds that may affect financial results down the road. For instance, companies that are still contending with issues like high inflation. In certain industries, this factor continues\u00a0 to affect consumer demand and spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, while some blue-chip stocks have sold off for good, that\u2019s not the case with the following seven stocks. Investor pessimism has pushed each one to a relatively low valuation. You may want to consider buying each one, as today\u2019s low prices may not necessarily last for long.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM) Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campus\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is among the world\u2019s top agribusiness companies. It\u2019s involved in many aspects of food production, from the processing and transport of agricultural raw materials, to the production of oilseeds and other food products. Yet while people need to eat, even in a recession, it\u2019s been far from smooth sailing for Archer-Daniels-Midland shares.\n\nADM stock has declined sharply since 2022, due demand and price weakness in the food commodity markets. That\u2019s not all. Back in January, shares took a nosedive, when an accounting scandal emerged. This issue largely entered the rearview mirror back in March. However, food commodities prices, boosted higher by the supply shocks that resulted from Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2022, have fallen back to 2021 levels.\n\nAs a result, the company has experienced a drop in profitability. Even so, now may be an opportune time to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d with ADM. Shares trade for only 11.7x forward earnings. Even if food prices fail to spike again, cost cutting efforts may lead to $500 million in cost savings over the next two years. ADM is also aggressively buying back stock. Back in March, the company announced plans to buy back $1 billion worth of its own shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nClorox (CLX) Clorox bleach bottles lined up on a store shelf.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlue-chip stocks in the healthcare sector are still getting over post-Covid hangovers, but so too is Clorox (NYSE:CLX), the household products giant best known for its eponymous brand of disinfectant products. Clorox shares have fallen considerably since the pandemic. Alongside declines in cleaning product sales, Clorox has been affected by inflation\u2019s squeeze on margins, as well as the fallout from a cyberattack in 2023.\n\nBut while CLX stock has continued pullback, there may still be merit in entering a long-term position at current prices. Issues resulting from the cyberattack have largely been resolved. Clorox sales may not re-hit pandemic-era levels anytime soon, but forecasts call for the company to report 9.3% earnings growth during the fiscal year ending June 2025.\n\nThat\u2019s a far greater level of earnings growth than what analysts are expecting for other household products stocks like Procter and Gamble (NYSE:PG). Yet while P&G sports a P/E in the mid-20s, you can buy Clorox for just 23 times forward earnings. If results meet or beat expectations, shares in this company, which is also a \u201cdividend aristocrat\u201d with a 3.55% annual yield, could surge on both earnings growth and multiple expansion.\n\nWalt Disney (DIS) Statue of Disney's (DIS) Mickey Mouse in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSource: spiderman777 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) was off to a strong start in the beginning of 2024. From January to April, shares in the entertainment conglomerate surged from $90 to over $120 per share, as a proxy contest launched by activist investor Nelson Peltz brought greater attention to, and appreciation of, Disney\u2019s streaming-focused turnaround efforts.\n\nHowever, since April, shares have coughed back most of these gains. DIS stock is now back to under $100 per share. Weak quarterly results have again cast doubt on whether this \u201cold school\u201d media company can profitably adapt to permanent changes in content consumption. Peltz\u2019s decision to cash out of DIS near its 52-week high suggests that shareholder activism won\u2019t be serving as a catalyst again anytime soon.\n\nYet while DIS is again out of favor among investors, this could work in your favor if you\u2019ve been waiting to enter a long-term position in this blue-chip. It may take time, but the company could prevail in its efforts to increase engagement with its streaming platforms. This may in turn enable Disney to retain and grow its userbase. In turn, turning streaming into a profit center, leading to renewed bullishness and a surge back toward prior price levels.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nBack in May, I made the case for McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) being one of the blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip. In a nutshell, I argued that issues like the fast food giant\u2019s sales slump, driven by factors like customer fatigue with high prices, as well as an overseas boycott of McDonalds related recent Middle East conflict, would prove temporary.\n\nAdmittedly, while other commentators have expressed a similar view, such a take hasn\u2019t been widely adopted by the market. As seen the sideways performance of MCD stock since mid-May, investors are by-and-large still taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d view. Still, while skepticism about a McDonald\u2019s comeback remains high, don\u2019t assume that the company is in some sort of long-term decline. As Morgan Stanley\u2019s Brian Harbour recently argued, the company\u2019s sales slump is likely to continue in the near term.\n\nHowever, Harbour has maintained an \u201coverweight\u201d price target, and a $300 per share price target on MCD, citing that the company\u2019s competitive advantages give it a greater chance of \u201crebuilding its value reputation\u201d compared to other fast food chains. With this, you may still want to go against the grain, and make a contrarian wager on the \u201cGolden Arches.\u201d\n\nMedtronic (MDT) Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocks\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) shares have experienced a modest dip in price since May, when this leading medical device manufacturer last reported fiscal results. Results for the preceding quarter were more-or-less mixed, and guidance came in weaker-than-expected.\n\nBut while MDT stock has declined in walked-back expectations, these may now be more-than accounted-for in its valuation. Shares today trade for only 14.6 times forward earnings. This represents a sharp discount to peers. Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX), for instance, trades for 17.6 times forward earnings, while other medical device names sport forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in the 20-30 range. That\u2019s not to say that Medtronic should, or will, eventually re-hit the loftier valuations it has traded at historically.\n\nHowever, if results do come in better-than-feared in the quarters ahead, a move back to a valuation in line with that of BDX may be within the realm of possibility. Sell-side consensus calls for MDT\u2019s earnings to hit $5.81 per share during the fiscal year ending April 2026. If this happens, and at the same time shares re-rate to the aforementioned valuation range, this $80 stock could by then be back to triple-digit price levels.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) has become one of the blue-chip stocks to buy on the dip following a pullback driven by changing expectations of the apparel and footwear company\u2019s future growth prospects.\n\nNKE stock tanked after its latest quarterly earnings release on June 27. Nike\u2019s reporting of lower-than-expected revenue and guidance led to an immediate price drop of nearly 20%. So far in July, shares have drifted to new multi-year lows. Yet while this widely-followed blue-chip may look right now like a falling knife, diving in today could prove profitable, not perilous. The recent sell-off has pushed NKE to a forward valuation in the low-20s, with a 2.04% forward dividend yield.\n\nNike has increased its dividend by an average of 11% annually over the past five years. Over a long time frame, these payouts could provide a significant boost to total returns. In terms of a price rebound, while the market now anticipates a long road ahead to recovery, that may not necessarily be the case. As InvestorPlace\u2019s Tyrik Torres recently argued, near-term catalysts like the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics could pave the way for stronger results. In turn, this may drive a sooner-than-expected recovery for shares.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve talked about quite a few blue-chips felled by poorly-received quarterly results. In the case of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), however, one can argue that the opposite is playing out. That is, the soft drink and snack food giant\u2019s latest quarterly results are helping to get PEP back on an upward trajectory.\n\nYes, PEP stock initially pulled back following the July 11 earnings release. Results were mixed, with a reported revenue miss. However, earnings exceeded expectations. Also, commentary from CEO Ramon Laguarta suggests that the company is looking to bring out lower product prices to boost demand. If the company can get back on track with sales growth, all while maintaining high single-digit annual earnings growth, investor enthusiasm could return to PEP.\n\nImproving sales growth may even be enough to bridge the valuation gap between PEP and its chief competitor Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). PEP trades for 20.7 times forward earnings, versus KO\u2019s forward multiple of 23.1.\u00a0If this were to happen, given forecasts calling for annual earnings of $8.77 per share in 2025, within a year PEP, now trading for around $169.50 per share, could hit prices topping $200 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

He is studying poll numbers. He's fending off increasing calls by those in his own party to step down as the Democratic nominee. He's contending with challenges to a golf match by Trump. He's a husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nAs for Trump, he is playing a lot of golf, campaigning, fighting off legal troubles, and trying to recover speedily from an assassination attempt.\n\nDespite their jam-packed schedules, I encourage both to put the poll numbers aside and turn off CNN, Morning Joe, Hannity, and Fox & Friends reruns.\n\nI would devote 10 minutes immediately to the earnings calls of big food makers PepsiCo (PEP) and Conagra Brands (CAG) from a week ago. Here are the transcripts for the PepsiCo and Conagra Brands calls, compliments of Yahoo Finance.\n\nThen, Trump and Biden should summon the CEOs of PepsiCo, Coca-Cola (KO), Conagra Brands, Campbell Soup (CPB), Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Whole Foods, Anheuser-Busch (BUD), JM Smucker (SJM), and others of similar ilk for a get-together.\n\nThe goal: obtain granular detail on why inflation is still so sticky and what specific actions food companies are taking to either offer more value or cut prices. The reason: American households are struggling, and it's going to take more than green jobs (Biden) and corporate tax cuts (Trump) to fix the problem.\n\nJust look at this consumer confidence chart from Morgan Stanley \u2014 confidence is back on a downtrend despite a \"steady\" job market. Confidence is back on the decline. (Morgan Stanley)\n\nIf these power men and their advisers aren't demanding answers from Big Food, the natural follow-up would be, why the hell not?\n\nIt's not enough to read government inflation data. I have personally long thought CPI, PPI, and all sorts of reports are wonky stuff to be used by people with econ PHDs or algo traders, detached from the real challenges that a single parent with two growing kids is facing.\n\nThese are the people who need an explanation of what is truly going on with prices and how four more years of the Biden administration will lessen the financial pain. Or how four more years of Trump will eradicate inflation for some time. Communicate clearly and effectively; the average household needs to hear it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause if the Biden administration doesn't do this simple exercise and Trump sidesteps it as well then, summoning the current president's go-to line, here's the deal: Consumers are going to take their financial frustrations out in 2025 and materially pull back on spending, and that will not be good for markets.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nHere is what I am talking about in terms of inflation realities.\n\nFrom PepsiCo's earnings call transcript:\n\n\"I know that for many categories, the multiple-year inflation that we had to take because our input costs went up has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive. And consumers are making choices, and they can make choices to cook versus buy finished goods or finished products, or they can make a lot of decisions around how they spend their money and how do they feed themselves every day with the lowest budget.\" \u2014 CEO Ramon Laguarta\n\nI caught up with Laguarta after the earnings call. I think you will see PepsiCo ramp up promotional strategies this summer and into year-end to reflect the financial situations of many households. Those strategies could range from cutting prices to offering two free bags of chips in a multi-pack.\n\nThat said, I left the call feeling the consumer is in a darker place than many people think. It's not often you hear a food CEO say potato chips need a \"value reset,\" which is another way of saying potato chips have gotten too expensive.\n\nPotato chips. Too expensive.\n\nExpect more of this lingo as other food companies report earnings soon.\n\nIn the same vein, I also caught up with the CEO of a very large publicly traded alcohol company. They told me they are seeing a major market share grab among private-label products at discounters like Walmart as consumers shun more expensive brand names. This CEO's products don't have private-label rivals in the US, so their comments only added fuel to my consumer worries.\n\nMeantime, from Conagra Brands' earnings call transcript:\n\n\"The nudging [of consumers by investing in lower prices] is working, but it is a transition. It's a process, and we've moved the needle meaningfully. And that will continue to move positive, but it's a transition. It's not one of these events where we sprinkle a little money on the consumer and they forget that they ever experienced runaway inflation. It's a period of adjustment.\" \u2014 CEO Sean Connolly\n\nWasn't frozen food always the cheaper option for dinner?\n\nI guess not, says one earnings call transcript I hope both Trump and Biden read.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Pepsi Is a Rock-Solid Dividend King, but So Is This High-Yield Value Stock That Paid $3 Billion in Dividends Over the Past Year",
        "content": "There are plenty of ways for a company to allocate its earnings. Some choose to reinvest most of their profits back into the business. Others repurchase their stock or pay dividends. No matter the strategy, the goal is to create value for investors.\n\nDividend stocks can be particularly attractive if you are looking to supplement your income in retirement or want an additional steady stream of income to bolster your finances at any stage of life. PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is a well-known stodgy dividend stock with a market-beating 3.2% yield. During the past 12 months, it has paid a whopping $7 billion in dividends. It has also raised its payout annually for more than 50 consecutive years -- making it a Dividend King.\n\nUtility giant Southern Company(NYSE: SO) has raised its payout every year since 2002, but has a 76-year track record of never cutting it. And, it has paid more than $3 billion in dividends over the last 12 months. With a yield of 3.5%, here's why Southern Company is a dividend stock worth considering now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAn integrated giant\n\nSouthern Company's business is primarily concentrated in the Southeastern U.S. Its traditional electric operating companies -- Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power -- provide the bulk of its revenue and earnings. Southern Company Gas is its natural gas distribution and utility segment, while Southern Power operates wind, solar, and natural gas generation facilities, most of them in the Southwest, South Central, and Southeastern U.S.\n\nThe utility achieved a major milestone in the first quarter, when it announced that Unit 4 of its massive Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Waynesboro, Georgia, had entered commercial operation. Unit 3 of that four-unit nuclear power plant came online in July 2023. Units 1 and 2 entered operation in the late 1980s.\n\nCombined, the plant now has 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity, making it the largest clean energy plant in the U.S. For context, the entire generating capacity of Southern Power is 13 GW across 55 facilities.\n\nA path to higher cash flows\n\nSouthern Company has a balanced portfolio across natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar. That's a different approach than a company like NextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) -- the most valuable U.S.-based utility by market cap -- which has built one of the world's largest renewable power companies, mainly in wind and solar.\n\nSouthern Company's capital expenditures steadily climbed as it worked to get projects off the ground. But now that its major projects are operational, expenditures could level off -- leading to higher cash flow and earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nVogtle represented a $10 billion investment in Georgia, which is more than Southern Company has ever spent on capital expenditures in a single year. According to its Vogtle Nuclear Brochure, it estimates that \"the incremental cost to complete the facility presents more than $3 billion in savings for customers compared to natural gas combined-cycle generation.\"\n\nIn sum, the utility giant is expanding its power-generation portfolio with sources that help its customers save money.\n\nSouthern Company is a great value\n\nSouthern Company trades at a reasonable valuation for such a steady performer. Its price-to-earnings ratio currently sits at 21.2, which is right around its average level during the past three to 10 years. SO PE Ratio Chart\n\nAnalysts' average estimates call for earnings per share of $4.01 in 2024 and $4.32 in 2025.\n\nSteady, high-single-digit percentage growth isn't usually something to get excited about. But Southern Company has stable inflows thanks to long-term contracts and power purchase agreements. Predictable earnings growth helps fuel its growing dividend.\n\nSouthern Company's yield is solid, but it is at the low end of its 10-year range because the stock has been such a strong performer. It has crushed the average performance of the utility sector during the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. Clearly, its business model is working. And with a diversified portfolio of projects and a reliable customer base, there's every reason to think Southern Company will maintain its consistency.\n\nA passive income powerhouse\n\nSouthern Company doesn't have the glitz and glam of a high-flying growth stock. But it is arguably one of the safest utility stocks -- and one of the safest dividend-paying stocks in general. It has a track record of financing and developing fossil fuel and renewable energy projects, making it a balanced play on the country's future energy needs.\n\nAdd it all up, and Southern Company looks like a simple yet effective way to boost your passive income stream for years, if not decades, to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Southern Company right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Southern Company , consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Southern Company wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP): Look Past Q2. This Defensive Stock Is Undervalued",
        "content": "Consumer staples giant PepsiCo (PEP)reported mixed Q2 earnings results on July 11. The results fell short from a top-line perspective, particularly in the Frito-Lay segment, exacerbated by tough comparisons with previous periods. While I maintain a bullish outlook on PEP due to its defensive nature, the stock\u2019s momentum has been challenged by headwinds such as high interest rates and inflation affecting consumer behavior, which also had led it to trade at a historically low valuation.\n\nThis recent underperformance of PEP stock reflects, in my opinion, a market trend favoring high-beta stocks over defensive names like PepsiCo itself. In this article, I\u2019ll delve into why PepsiCo\u2019s Q2 results were underwhelming yet decent and why investing in PepsiCo at its current price could be a smart move.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Q2 Earnings Review\n\nPepsiCo recently reported its Q2 results, once again topping earnings estimates with EPS of $2.28, while the consensus was $2.16. As a high-quality company known for consistently beating estimates, these figures didn\u2019t come as a surprise. However, PEP shares saw only modest movement after hours and opened the next trading session virtually unchanged.\n\nThe major concern this quarter was PepsiCo\u2019s top line, which came in at $22.5 billion against an expected $22.59 billion. There were already concerns about one of PepsiCo\u2019s popular brands, Frito-Lay, and these concerns proved valid. Organic volume for Frito-Lay segment in North America dropped by 4%. The snacking category is under pressure due to macroeconomic factors and the emergence of GLP-1 drugs, which suppress appetite and could lead to reduced snack purchases.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note that this issue isn\u2019t isolated to PepsiCo but affects the entire snacking industry. This signals a warning for other packaged food companies, which may need to increase spending beyond their initial forecasts to boost sales volume in the current market environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, PepsiCo\u2019s CEO, Ramon Laguarta, signaled plans to pursue disciplined commercial investments, saying, \u201cFor the balance of the year, we will further elevate and accelerate our productivity initiatives and make disciplined commercial investments in the marketplace to stimulate growth.\u201d\n\nEssentially, this means they\u2019ll focus on stabilizing operations rather than aggressively pursuing market share. This lack of competitive pressure from their main rivals, in my opinion, bodes well for investors, as it helps maintain profitability and avoids costly price battles that could eat into margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking at the broader picture, PepsiCo reported 2% organic non-GAAP revenue growth in Q2 and a 9% year-to-date increase in earnings per share for the first half of 2024. Across its product categories and geographies, there was a 5% increase in effective pricing, which resulted in a 3% decrease in total organic volume, as you can see in the image below. PepsiCo has been raising prices for over a year and a half now, with continuously increasing effective net pricing. But finally, consumers are pulling back, and that\u2019s a significant change this year.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that PepsiCo faced tough comps from Q2 last year when consumer behavior favored more home-based spending. While these comparisons are challenging, I think it\u2019s decent that PepsiCo is still achieving 2% organic revenue growth.\n\nThe real highlight, though, is how well PepsiCo managed costs despite slower revenue growth. Non-GAAP cost of sales dropped from $10.1 billion to $9.9 billion this quarter, and SG&A expenses fell by 30%. This resulted in a 10.6% increase in operating profit year-over-year. This solid expense management helped balance things out and likely avoided more negative reactions.\n\nWhy Owning PEP Now Is Compelling\n\nIn the market we\u2019ve seen over the past year, cyclical and high-beta stocks have been favored over defensive ones. And, to be clear, PepsiCo stands out as a solid defensive pick. With a low two-year beta of 0.33, PepsiCo\u2019s stock tends to move about one-third as much as the overall market in the same direction. This characteristic means that during economic turbulence, owning stocks like PepsiCo provides an added cushion for risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe case for including PepsiCo in a portfolio becomes even more compelling when considering its current valuation. The stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 20.9x,\u00a0which represents\u00a0a discount of 14.2% compared to its historical average over the last half-decade.\n\nThis discount, I believe, reflects the Consumer Staples sector\u2019s challenges with high interest rates and ongoing inflation. These factors have curbed consumer spending and squeezed PepsiCo\u2019s revenue, leading to two revenue estimate misses in the last three quarters (Q4 2023 and Q2 2024).\n\nWhile facing headwinds that have impacted the company\u2019s top-line growth, PepsiCo maintains a robust balance sheet with an increasing cash position, as evidenced by its $6.35 billion in cash and equivalents, marking a nearly 4% year-over-year increase.\n\nAlso, its dividend yield remains above 3%,\u00a0which is\u00a010% higher than the average of the last five years. Moreover, the company raised its dividend by 7% in Q1, continuing a streak of increases over the past 51 years. This indicates a payout ratio of 65%, slightly below its historical five-year average.\n\nIs PepsiCo Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWhile not all Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on PepsiCo shares, the consensus rating is a Moderate Buy. Out of the 18 analysts covering the stock, 11 rate it as a Buy, while the remainder have Hold ratings. The average PEP stock price target is $186.41, suggesting upside potential of 10.1% based on the most recent share price for PEP stock.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nPepsiCo faced some tough comps in Q2, with consumer behavior more sensitive to pricing, impacting top-line growth. While these results fell short of expectations, robust cost control managed to stabilize things, avoiding what could have been a much worse quarter.\n\nOverall, the bottom line is that while buying PepsiCo shares today may not be exciting in the short term, I believe the company\u2019s track record as a defensive investment should prove successful over the long term. This remains true, as strong fundamentals and a discounted valuation should outweigh concerns about macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "3 Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "On July 16, CNBC reported, \u201cSmall-cap stocks are on a tear right now.\u201d The financial news channel\u2019s website noted that, during the preceding week, the category became the market leader, at least temporarily. Indeed, the Russell 2000 index, made up of small-cap names, hit its highest level since January 2022 on July 16. With most on the Street betting that the Federal Reserve will start an interest rate-cutting cycle in September, many large investors are anxious to get more exposure to small-cap stocks. That\u2019s because those names, due to the fact that many lose money and have high debt loads, are seen as among the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates.\n\nAlso importantly, Joshua Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and a CNBC commentator, recently said on the channel that the rally of small-cap stocks could last a month. But since the rate-cut cycle will likely last many months and a high percentage of small-cap names have been beaten down tremendously, I think the surge could easily last until the end of this year. With that said, here are three Russell 2000 stocks to buy now.\n\nLithia Motors (LAD) Lithia Motors Retail company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAuto retailer Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD) should get a big boost from the Fed\u2019s upcoming interest rate cuts. That\u2019s because most consumers borrow money in order to purchase vehicles, so lower rates make it much more affordable for them to buy automobiles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLithia\u2019s business is already growing rapidly, as its top line surged 23% last quarter, versus the same period a year earlier, to an all-time record of $8.6 billion. Further, the retailer\u2019s new vehicle same-store units handed over rose by an impressive 3.6% year-over-year.\n\nLithia\u2019s operating income dropped significantly, coming in at $348.1 million from $373.2 million in Q1 of 2023. However, the interest rate cuts should enable the company to meaningfully lift its prices, significantly raising its profitability.\n\nThe shares have a very low forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10, and the company announced last month that it would increase its share buyback total by $350 million to $660 million.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) stock has tumbled in recent weeks because the Street is worried about the energy-drink maker\u2019s growth slowing. However, the firm\u2019s growth appears to be slowing, primarily because its distribution partner, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), accumulated too much inventory of Celsius\u2019 beverages and has been working through that inventory in recent weeks. That should be a temporary issue since Celsius\u2019 growth is likely to reaccelerate once Pepsi has worked through its excess inventory.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, despite this issue, Celsius\u2019 top line still jumped by an impressive 37% in Q1 versus the same period a year earlier. Further, due to Celsius\u2019 low calorie count and the impressive amount of vitamins it provides compared to other energy drinks, I\u2019m confident it will deliver strong financial results in the medium and long term.\n\nAlso upbeat on CELH stock is investment bank William Blair. According to the bank, the beverage maker offered \u201ccompelling perspectives and proof points\u201d\u00a0on the long-term outlook of its business in May.\n\nGiven these points, I view the name as one of the best Russell 2000 stocks to buy now.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) has been getting big lifts from the surging popularity of its HOKA and UGG footwear.\n\nIn its fiscal Q4 that ended in March, the company\u2019s top line jumped 21% versus the same period a year earlier to $960 million, while its income from operations soared to $144.26 million from $105.92 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Very impressively, the net sales of its HOKA footwear advanced 34% year-over-year to $533 million.\n\nIn the wake of Decker\u2019s financial results, investment bank Truist (NYSE:TFC) upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold. Truist believes the company is \u201cfiring on all cylinders\u201d and has plenty of growth opportunities going forward. Specifically, it expects Deckers to gain more market share than the Street expects and predicts that UGG will become more popular overseas. Truist believes the brand will gain momentum as awareness among consumers about its new sneakers and sandals grows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in CELH.

        "title": "3 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "As we navigate through Q3 of 2024, all major indexes continue to set new record highs on an almost weekly basis. During this bullish rally, discovering high-quality dividend growth stocks that still trade at reasonable valuations has become increasingly challenging. Still, not all stocks have kept pace with the broader market\u2019s ascent. Many quality names have lagged, creating potential opportunities for investors looking to generate growing income.\n\nIn this article, I will highlight three dividend growth stocks that remain attractively valued despite the market\u2019s recent surge. The following companies are characterized by their solid dividend growth track records, each consistently increasing their dividends for at least 15 years. I have also ensured that these stocks feature a dividend growth compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 8% over the past decade to ensure their income growth has exceeded inflation.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to bolster your portfolio with reliable income-generating assets or seeking stocks with a proven history of rewarding shareholders at a discount, these three picks are worth your attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) stands out as one of the most appealing dividend growth stocks to consider in Q3. As a global leader in the food and beverage industry, PepsiCo boasts a diverse portfolio of iconic brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lay\u2019s, and Quaker. This lineup has solidified the company\u2019s dominance in the consumer staples sector. Moreover, PepsiCo has exhibited consistent growth over the years due to the inelastic demand for its products.\n\nIn line with my criteria, PepsiCo\u2019s dividend growth track record is remarkable, featuring 52 consecutive years of dividend increases. This means the company is a member of the elite group of stocks known as Dividend Kings. Also, over the past decade, the company has increased its dividend per share (DPS) at a CAGR of 8.2%, providing its shareholders with growing income that has outpaced inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, PepsiCo appears well-positioned for growth, particularly in international markets where its products consistently gain market share each quarter. Simultaneously, the stock\u2019s ongoing decline has pushed its dividend yield to a compelling 3.3%. Combined with the stock trading at a P/E of 20.2X based on this year\u2019s expected earnings per share (EPS), which is below its historical average, I find PepsiCo\u2019s investment case rather attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\nAir Products and Chemicals (APD) Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock\n\nThe second strong dividend growth forming a compelling investment case as we enter Q3 is Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD). The industrial gases company provides essential products and services to a wide range of industries, including energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. Its shares have declined by about 14% over the past year. Historically, Air Products and Chemicals stock has rarely underperformed the market, suggesting the recent lag presents an attractive buying opportunity\u2014especially with its growth prospects remaining robust.\n\nFor context, Air Products boasts a tremendous dividend growth track record, having hiked its dividend every year for the past 42 years. Over the past decade, the company\u2019s dividend increases have recorded a CAGR of 9.5%, a special feat considering the long-established nature of this growth trajectory.\n\nIn the meantime, the stock\u2019s decline over the past year has led to its forward P/E getting compressed to roughly 20X, slightly below its 10-year average. I believe this presents a compelling opportunity, further solidified by consensus estimates, which see Air Products and Chemicals\u2019 EPS growing at a CAGR of 10.4% over the next five years.\n\nArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM) Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocks. Sleeper Growth Stocks\n\nSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / Shutterstock\n\nThe final dividend growth stock on my list is Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM). At $64.40 today, ADM\u2019s stock seems to be notably undervalued. It is significantly below its 2022 peak of about $97 and close to the levels seen in spring 2021. Yet, its investment case remains robust. Being one of the world\u2019s most prominent agricultural processors and food ingredient providers, ADM is still well-positioned to keep delivering strong results moving forward.\n\nThis notion has held true for decades. ADM has proven its resilience, as its essential farm products, like vegetable oils, sweeteners, and both plant-based and animal-based proteins, are vital for meeting global nutritional needs. This resilient demand for its products means its business model is recession-resistant, which explains how the company has managed to increase its dividend year over the past 51 years. Its dividend growth CAGR over the past decade also stands at a strong 9%, even though many investors perceive farm products as generally lacking growth prospects.\n\nWith shares currently trading at only 11.7 times this year\u2019s EPS, I believe that ADM stock presents a significant margin of safety for investors concerned about lofty valuations in today\u2019s market. Furthermore, its current dividend yield stands at 3.2%, providing decent income. The dividend yield is also likely to appeal to a broader investor base as interest rate cuts come into play.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Help Pay Your Bills",
        "content": "While active acquisition is perhaps the most common methodology of gaining wealth, it\u2019s not always the most efficient. For example, even if you trade your hours for a generous paycheck, there are only so many hours available: in a day, in a week, in a month, you get the idea. So, you need to find a way to have your money make money, which is where high-yield dividend stocks come into play.\n\nWhen participating in the equities space, it\u2019s generally a good idea to have exposure to passive-income-providing enterprises. Your stable blue chips provide a frequent flow of income (typically on a quarterly basis). Space out your high-yield dividend stocks by their payment dates and you can potentially enjoy robust yields every month. This may allow you to pay your bills.\n\nBest of all, passive income is, well, passive. You don\u2019t have to do anything to get the payout (so long as the company remains consistently profitable). With that in mind, below are high-yield dividend stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest beverage and snack product manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) makes a great case for high-yield dividend stocks. For sure, soft drinks and potato chips aren\u2019t exactly riveting products. However, they benefit from consistent, everyday demand. Further, with inflation impacting consumer spending, people are likelier to get their calories from the grocery aisles. That favors Pepsi\u2019s core business.\n\nWhat\u2019s attractive about the company is that in the past four quarters, PepsiCo posted an average earnings per share of $1.95. This didn\u2019t scorch the analysts\u2019 estimates, which came in at $1.86. Still, a beat is a beat. Further, the average earnings surprise came out to 4.83%.\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), PepsiCo posted EPS of $6.89 on sales of $92.05 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate earnings of $8.16 per share, up 15.42% from last year. Also, sales could hit $94.07 billion, up 10.8%.\n\nLastly, the company offers a forward yield of 3.26%. While the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 74.75%, the consistency and predictability of the business makes PEP a compelling opportunity.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top-tier player in the drug manufacturing industry, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) commands significant relevancies. Its main product is Humira, which is an injection for autoimmune disorders and other conditions. It has also developed advanced therapeutic candidates to treat vexing ailments such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. AbbVie is recognized the world over for its oncology portfolio, making ABBV a formidable play among high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s not a remarkable enterprise. However, in the past four quarters, the company beat all of its bottom-line targets. The average EPS came out to $2.74, pipping the collective consensus view of $2.67. Overall, the average earnings surprise landed at 2.75%.\n\nIn the TTM period, AbbVie posted EPS of $3.35 on revenue of $54.4 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate a modest dip in earnings in $10.80 per share. However, revenue rise modestly to $55.21 billion, an increase of 1.6%.\n\nIn terms of passive income, AbbVie offers a forward yield of 3.69%. Admittedly, the payout ratio is sky high so it\u2019s something to monitor. Still, for the various therapeutics on tap, ABBV is an intriguing candidate for high-yield dividend stocks.\n\nShell (SHEL) Shell logo on a gas station in Iceland. SHEL stock\n\nSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s top supermajors, Shell (NYSE:SHEL) is a giant within the integrated oil and gas industry. This means that the company is involved in multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. What may draw investors\u2019 attention toward SHEL stock is the latest political dynamic. With former President Donald Trump poised for an easy electoral victory, fossil fuels seem compelling.\n\nRepublicans are well known for supporting the hydrocarbon industry. It\u2019s also possible that a second Trump administration can roll back some of President Joe Biden\u2019s climate-forward initiatives. To be sure, the oil market has been a choppy one, with Shell missing its earnings target in Q2 2023. However, in the past year since Q1 2024, its average EPS came out to $1.98, beating out the consensus $1.77.\n\nIn the TTM period, Shell posted EPS of $5.46 on sales of $302.14 billion. In fiscal 2024, analysts are targeting EPS of $8.40, implying modest growth of 1.1%. Sales may see a slight bump to $322.19 billion, up 1.8%.\n\nThe forward yield is quite robust, though, at 3.77%. With a modest payout ratio of 47.38%, Shell is one of the high-yield dividend stocks to buy.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s tobacco giants, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) might seem awfully anachronistic. After all, global smoking prevalence rates have been declining. Still, what keeps PM in business is that the concept of adult liberties will likely never fade permanently. Consumers have different ways of handling stress. Also, some folks enjoy certain practices.\n\nHowever, where PM stock may really come alive over the next several years is in its alternative products: vaporizers, e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn devices. Whatever you want to call them, tobacco firms are building them. For the most part, Philip Morris is resonating with its consumer base. In the past four quarters, it managed to post an average EPS of $1.53. This performance beat out the collective consensus view of $1.49.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the tobacco firm posted EPS of $5.12 on revenue of $35.95 billion. By the end of the fiscal year, experts believe EPS could rise 5.16% to $6.32. On the top line, sales may see an increase of 5.2% to $37.07 billion.\n\nFinally, Philip Morris brings a forward yield of 4.91% to the table. It\u2019s one of the high-yield dividend stocks to consider.\n\nVici Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nBased in New York City, Vici Properties (NYSE:VICI) falls under the diversified real estate investment trust (or REIT) industry. Per its public profile, Vici owns one of the largest portfolios of market-leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations. While the entity represents one of the higher-risk ideas among high-yield dividend stocks, it\u2019s also intriguing. That\u2019s because Vici could benefit from the travel prioritization trend.\n\nFollowing off the back of the revenge travel concept, consumers are not as acutely eager to get out of the house. However, families are still prioritizing their discretionary budget to fit in vacation time. It\u2019s possible that the Covid-19 crisis taught everyone that life is short. Unfortunately, Vici hasn\u2019t consistently benefited from this potential catalyst.\n\nIn the past four quarters, it posted an average EPS of 63 cents. However, this slightly missed the target of 64 cents, resulting in a negative earnings surprise of 1%. Still, analysts do see a recovery in EPS to $2.55, up 3.24% from last year. Also, sales may rise 5.7% to $3.82 billion.\n\nVici carries a forward yield of 5.48% and a relatively reasonable payout ratio of 64.88%.\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB) A LyondellBasell production plant in Wesseling, Germany is seen at dusk.\n\nSource: Flagmania / Shutterstock.com\n\nFalling under the basic materials sector, LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB) focuses on specialty chemicals. Primarily, the company operates in the U.S. However, it also features facilities in diverse regions such as Germany, Mexico, Italy and Poland, among many others. Its products are essential for multiple industries, including food packaging, automotive components and hydrocarbon production.\n\nSo long as the machinery of the global economy keeps moving forward, LYB stock should benefit from steady business flow. Sure enough, in the past four quarters, LyondellBasell posted an average EPS of $1.96. This easily beat the collective consensus view of $1.75 or an earnings surprise of 11.7%.\n\nIn the TTM period, LyondellBasell posted EPS of $6.48 on sales of $40.78 billion. For fiscal 2024, EPS could see a modest dip to $8.29. Revenue may stay roughly the same at $41.17 billion, though the high-side estimate calls for $43.16 billion.\n\nRegarding passive income, the company posted a forward yield of 5.6%. While the payout ratio is a bit high at 77.16%, the relevance of the business makes LYB reasonably safe. Thus, it\u2019s one of the high-yield dividend stocks to consider.\n\nHealthpeak Properties (DOC) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in Denver, Colorado, Healthpeak Properties (NYSE:DOC) is a fully integrated REIT as well as an S&P 500 company. As you might imagine from the corporate label, the entity owns, operates\u00a0 and develops high-quality real estate for healthcare discovery and delivery. Fundamentally, what may benefit DOC stock is the permanence of the underlying narrative. Irrespective of economic conditions, people will still seek personal care.\n\nTo be fair, the financials for this REIT have been choppy. In the past year since Q1, Healthpeak posted an average EPS of 9 cents. This matched the collective consensus view but that\u2019s not the whole story. In terms of earnings surprise, Healthpeak actually slipped almost 6% below parity. Big misses in Q2 2023 and especially Q1 hurt the overall picture.\n\nDuring the TTM period, the REIT posted EPS of 35 cents on sales of $2.26 billion. By year\u2019s end, EPS could reach 38 cents. However, that would be a 32.14% loss from the prior year. That\u2019s not great. However, revenue may rise almost 20% to $2.61 billion. As well, earnings could improve in fiscal 2025.\n\nHealthpeak offers a forward yield of 5.81%, making it an attractive idea for high-yield dividend stocks to speculate on.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an all-time high of 40,720.64 on July 15. Despite the new record, the 30 blue-chip stocks that make up the index are only up 8% in 2024, less than half the S&P 500.\n\nGone are the days when investors considered these 30 Dow stocks the best investments you could own for the long haul. Technology certainly has had something to do with the changing of the guard. The same could be said for consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nToday\u2019s blue chips are not necessarily the Dow 30. They\u2019re stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) with growth potential for years, if not decades, to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, if you buy blue-chip stocks in July, it should be one of these three alternatives to Dow 30 stocks. Each operates in the same sector as the three Dow 30 stocks, with better prospective returns over the long haul.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinviz.com considers Costco (NASDAQ:COST) part of the consumer defensive sector. Others would say \u201cconsumer staples.\u201d That\u2019s neither here nor there. It is my blue-chip stock to buy as an alternative to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).\n\nJames Quincey became the CEO of Coca-Cola in January 2017 after 11 years at the company. In the past 7.5 years, he\u2019s been the beverage company\u2019s top leader, and its shares have appreciated by 54%. COST stock returned 427% in the same period, nearly eight times Coca-Cola\u2019s performance.\n\nI\u2019m a long-time Costco shopper. Its recent announcement that it would raise the annual membership fee Sept. 1 to $65 for its individual Gold Star and business members in the U.S. and Canada. Its premium memberships in the U.S. and Canada will rise to $130.\n\nThe stock fell on the news.\n\nHowever, considering it hasn\u2019t raised the membership fee since 2017 and is about two years past the five-year historical average, I\u2019m not sure how members or investors can be negative about the action taken.\n\nCostco has always been about providing consumers with the lowest prices possible, generating most of its profits from membership fees. Compared to beverage companies Coke and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which have gone hog wild on price increases over the past two years, Costco has held its prices steady.\n\nIt\u2019s a much better blue-chip stock.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J.

Others would say \u201cconsumer discretionary.\u201d It is one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy as an alternative to McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD).\n\nFirst, if you want to own a restaurant stock, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NASDAQ:CMG) would be a better choice given its pricing power, but I digress.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn May, the company reported Q1 2024 results that included earnings per share of 93 cents, 22.4% higher than a year ago and five cents better than analyst expectations. Revenue increased by 5.9% year-over-year to $12.48 billion. However, some investors focused on the 3.0% same-store sales growth in the quarter, 70 basis points less than the Wall Street consensus.\n\nFor the second quarter, it sees an EPS of 89 cents at the midpoint of guidance, five cents shy of analyst expectations. One analyst, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe, sees this as a case of \u201cunderpromise and overdeliver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe guidance remains conservative, and continue to see a favorable buying environment for [TJX\u2019s stock],\u201d MarketWatch reported Tarlowe\u2019s comments to clients.\n\nAs McDonald\u2019s prices have risen, the restaurant chain has struggled to keep low-income customers buying its products. TJX is the better blue-chip stock to buy.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is part of the communication services sector. I\u2019m making a controversial call by selecting it as a better blue-chip stock to buy than Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).\n\nThat\u2019s especially true since the social media platform\u2019s stock struggled in the past month, down over 7%. However, over the past five years, despite underperforming relative to the index, PINS stock gained 59%, 89 percentage points better than Disney.\n\nFurther, with the country divided, it\u2019s about the only social media platform whose user interactions aren\u2019t completely unhealthy and uncalled for. It\u2019s very good for the future. Here\u2019s why.\n\nIn Q1 2024, its earnings jumped 150%. FactSet estimates suggest that they\u2019ll rise 32% YOY in Q2, 23% in Q3 and 19% for Q4, with revenue growth over this period of 19.5% per quarter.\n\n\u201c\u2018Thanks to our investments in AI (artificial intelligence) and shopability, we\u2019re driving even greater returns for advertisers and gaining access to performance budgets,\u2019 said Bill Ready, Pinterest CEO, in its earnings recent report. The company generates revenue from online ads,\u201d Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported.\n\nI might be an outlier, but I believe its stock will outperform Disney over the next five years like it did the past five. That makes it a top blue-chip stock to buy in July.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See PepsiCo (PEP) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nPepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.90, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.90 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 55% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PEP Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEP\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs PEP a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $8.15.\n\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo with a grain of salt.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Dividend Stocks With 3%+ Yields to Upgrade Your Annual Income",
        "content": "If you are a passive income investor like me, you will always be on the lookout for high-yield dividend stocks. However, not all stocks are made equal.\u00a0Some companies might pay dividends\u00a0but\u00a0the payment may not be sustainable\u00a0and\u00a0this\u00a0can put your regular income at risk.\u00a0On the other hand, some companies might pay a very high dividend when they make\u00a0strong profits and cut down the dividend payout when the profit drops.\n\nAs\u00a0a smart\u00a0investor, it is essential to look for companies that pay steady dividends and have the free cash flow\u00a0to be able\u00a0to sustain the same. A dividend yield shows the percentage of the company\u2019s share price paid\u00a0in the form of\u00a0a dividend. When picking high-yield dividend stocks, it is\u00a0important\u00a0to watch out for the dividend yield and the payout ratio.\n\nWhile a high-dividend yield is attractive,\u00a0a number\u00a0over 5% can be risky. It is best to look for a dividend yield in the range of 2% to 4%. I\u2019ve picked out three dividend stocks with a 3%+ yield that will upgrade your annual income. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nA household name and a global giant,\u00a0PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) enjoys a strong position in the industry.\u00a0The stock has seen a pullback recently and is down 5% year-to-date. Exchanging hands for $163, PepsiCo trades much lower than its 52-week high of $192. The stock enjoys a dividend yield of 3.31% and has raised dividends for 52 consecutive years.\n\nThe recent\u00a0quarterly results weren\u2019t as impressive for the company\u00a0with\u00a0a revenue miss. It reported a revenue of $22.5 billion, up 1% year-over-year, and an earnings-per-share of $2.28. The management stated that consumers have become value-conscious and are pushing back on purchases. However, one quarter speaks nothing about the company\u2019s solid market share and potential. I\u2019d consider this pullback as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe reason behind\u00a0PepsiCo\u2019s revenue drop is inflation\u00a0and\u00a0it is a temporary concern. It has taken a toll on consumer spending\u00a0which\u00a0could normalise in the coming quarters. With PepsiCo, there is no threat of losing your money\u00a0and\u00a0if you are looking for a steady dividend income over the next decade, PepsiCo is the stock to buy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is another favorite dividend stock with a yield of 4.19%. The company is a cash flow machine\u00a0and enjoys\u00a0a strong upward and downward stream business. With oil prices steadily rising, Chevron is going to benefit.\u00a0As compared\u00a0to the other oil giants in the industry, Chevron has a\u00a0strong\u00a0business model and minimal debt\u00a0which\u00a0offers\u00a0it adequate financial flexibility.\u00a0It can handle volatility while rewarding shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, as Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite energy stock, Chevron has a solid runway.\u00a0The oil demand\u00a0is not going to drop anytime soon\u00a0and\u00a0this\u00a0means Chevron will continue raking in cash.\u00a0While we attempt to move towards renewables, there is no certainty that we will\u00a0become successful there\u00a0and\u00a0it cannot be done\u00a0overnight.\n\nTrading at $158, CVX stock is up 5% YTD and 26% in the past five years. The company has increased dividends for 37 consecutive years and\u00a0has the flexibility to\u00a0keep hiking dividends in the coming years. It currently pays an annual dividend of $6.52\u00a0which\u00a0isn\u2019t bad for a stock trading at $158. Thus, Chevron is an attractive long-term bet for dividend investors.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIncorporated in 1886, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the most reliable pharmaceutical stocks\u00a0to own. The company has been around longer than many of us can imagine\u00a0and\u00a0it has seen it all. Having survived inflation, recession, wars, and market turmoil, Johnson & Johnson remains at the forefront of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.\n\nTrading at $149, JNJ stock is down 6% YTD and trading much lower than the 52-week high of $175. The pullback is a chance to buy the stock with a dividend yield of 3.32%. The company has increased dividend payouts for 52 consecutive years and remains a dividend aristocrat.\n\nThe\u00a0strong\u00a0business has been under pressure due to the talc lawsuits and\u00a0the process has troubled the management for several years.\u00a0Once the company settles this lawsuit, it will be in a better position and could help\u00a0give the stock a boost.\n\nIts first-quarter sales came in at $21.4 billion, up 2.3% YOY\u00a0and\u00a0the majority of that\u00a0came from the innovative medicine segment. It\u00a0is aiming to achieve a growth rate of\u00a05% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 and has a pipeline of at least\u00a010\u00a0drugs that can generate $5 billion in annual sales.\u00a0JNJ stock might be down today\u00a0but\u00a0it is not out\u00a0and\u00a0buying the stock in the dip could be a solid move.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): Is It the Best Dividend Stock Right Now According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Stocks For Dividends. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other dividend stocks.\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks underperformed compared to the overall market, which was driven largely by tech stocks. As we move into the latter half of 2024, dividend stocks have shown a similar performance trend in the first half of the year. The Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, is down by 0.17% year-to-date, compared with a nearly 18% gain in the broader market. Dividend stocks are declining for two main reasons. First, high interest rates are drawing investors towards bonds instead. Second, the current surge in AI technology is capturing investors' focus on tech stocks. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has achieved its all-time high this year, surging by over 25% so far in 2024. That said, investors haven't completely lost faith in dividend stocks. When all is said and done, successful investing is about playing the long game. Dividend stocks have consistently delivered, accounting for 36% of the market's total return since 1927. Bank of America has also declared 2024 as \u2018the year of dividends\u2019.\n\nIn dividend investing, dividend growth stocks often take a lead over high-yield dividend stocks. Recent research indicates that companies providing consistent and sustainable dividends, without excessive payouts, have delivered the best long-term returns. Wellington Management conducted a study that categorized dividend-paying companies into five groups based on their payout levels. Since 1930, the research found that stocks with the highest dividend payouts generally performed similarly to those with high, but not the very highest, payouts, although they frequently traded places as the top performers over the decades.\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 Very High Yield Dividend Stocks With Upside Potential\n\nThe dividend growth strategy has become so prominent over the years that many companies in the US are steadily increasing their payouts. In 2023, dividend payments reached an all-time high and have consistently increased over the years. Analysts are very optimistic about dividend payments for 2024, and recent projections indicate that the companies are on course to meet this new target record. One of the key reasons for this growth is that many companies, especially large technology firms, have abundant cash reserves and are rapidly increasing their free cash flows. This strong financial position enables them to continue rewarding their investors with higher dividend payments. According to the latest report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, companies in the index paid $153.4 billion in dividends in the second quarter of 2024, up from $151.6 billion from the previous quarter and up from $143.2 billion in the same period last year. The report also mentioned that there were 539 reported dividend increases, compared to 460 in the prior-year period, marking a 17.2% year-over-year rise. The total amount of these dividend increases reached $20.4 billion for the quarter, up from $9.8 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend growth stocks are a hit with investors because they have rock-solid businesses, a steady cash flow, and strong balance sheets. These companies are top-notch for generating passive income. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo compile this list, we thoroughly reviewed reputable sources such as Forbes, Morningstar, Barron\u2019s, and Business Insider. From their latest articles, we gathered the stocks they collectively favored. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey's Q1 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in these companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:PEP) has signed a long-term partnership deal with Yara International ASA to equip farmers with advanced crop nutrition programs and decarbonize the food value chain across Europe.\n\nThe collaboration will provide farmers with best-in-class crop nutrition products, precision farming digital tools, and expert advice to improve nutrient use efficiency, boost yields, and reduce the carbon footprint of their crops, the company claims.\n\nAs part of this partnership, Yara will supply PepsiCo with up to 165,000 tons of fertilizer annually, covering about 25% of their crop fertilizer needs in Europe by 2030.\n\nThese fertilizers will include Yara Climate Choice fertilizers, which have a low carbon footprint and are produced from either renewable ammonia or low-carbon ammonia via carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nThis effort supports farmers through transition costs, ensuring their livelihoods are maintained.\n\nAlso Read: Salmonella Saga: FDA Reportedly Uncovers Years of Contamination at PepsiCo Plant\n\nThe partnership will initially focus on potatoes, a significant crop for PepsiCo, and expand to other crops such as oats and corn. It will involve approximately 1,000 farms and cover around 128,000 hectares in the EU and U.K.\n\nIt will also scale up sustainable nutrient management practices across PepsiCo's farmer groups, including full-season crop and soil data capture and monitoring using PepsiCo's CropTrak and ML Analytics tools, complemented by Yara's digital solutions.\n\nNatural gas serves as both a feedstock and an energy source in nitrogen fertilizer production. Green ammonia, an alternative, is made by combining hydrogen from water electrolysis using renewable energy with nitrogen, reported Bloomberg.\n\nWhile the production of green ammonia is energy-intensive, companies like Yara are working to increase its availability.\n\nPepsi reported second-quarter sales growth of 0.8% year-on-year to $22.501 billion, missing the analyst consensus estimate of $22.599 billion.\n\nPepsiCo stock has lost about 11% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "By Krystal Hu\n\n(Reuters) - SymphonyAI, a U.S. artificial intelligence company whose products help the likes of Pepsi predict demand and financial companies spot fraud, is preparing to go public in the second half of next year, its chief executive said in an interview.\n\nSanjay Dhawan, CEO at SymphonyAI, said the firm is in talks with banks but declined to disclose details or stages of preparations.\n\nThe plan to list publicly came as SymphonyAI reached $500 million in revenue run rate last year and achieved profitability, after growing revenue at a rate of about 25%, according to Dhawan.\n\nThe firm, founded seven years ago by tech billionaire Romesh Wadhwani, is hoping a public listing could provide liquidity for executives and employees, as well as access to additional capital for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe U.S. IPO market has started to show signs of recovery this year, with 86 IPOs raising $17.8 billion in the first six months, according to data from EY. KKR-backed enterprise finance platform OneStream announced on Monday plans to raise $465.5 million in an IPO later this month, which could help others gauge how the market values software companies.\n\nDhawan, who previously ran publicly traded automotive AI firm Cerence, said SymphonyAI is already meeting public company compliance standards, with KPMG as auditors and an independent board.\n\nThe timing of listing could still change, depending on business and market conditions, he added.\n\n\u201cGoing public is one milestone in a journey. Once we identify a use case that we can disrupt with AI, we use M&A as a mechanism to add a volume of customers, which we can transform with AI,\u201d Dhawan said.\n\nWadhwani, who is chairman of the company after pouring $600 million into the SymphonyAI, remains the largest shareholder.\n\nHeadquartered in Palo Alto, California, SymphonyAI serves more than 2,000 customers, including PepsiCo and Citadel. Predictive AI remains central to the company's products, although it has added generative AI features.\n\nWith more than 3,000 employees across 30 countries, SymphonyAI competes with C3.AI, which has a market cap of nearly $4 billion with about $310 million in annual revenue.\n\n\"We want to pick very specific industries and create these turnkey solutions, which are AI based applications, for our enterprise customers,\u201d Dhawan said.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in San Francisco, Editing by Louise Heavens)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Ever thought of generating multiple streams of income? Other than bringing in a salary or earning a commission, another effective method is to park some money in reliable dividend stocks.\n\nThese stocks should make consistent payments every three months to supplement your earned paycheck. They are a great way to diversify your income sources and help you boost your overall cash intake.\n\nThe key to finding solid dividend stocks is to look for mature businesses that are producing copious amounts of cash. Ideally, these companies should also possess a strong brand, generate lots of free cash flow (FCF), have a robust business model, and a track record of consistent dividend increases. For dividend-seeking investors, these are the attributes that help build and grow income.\n\nHere are three robust dividend-paying stocks that you can buy with just $1,000. Image source: Getty images.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) products are sold in more than 200 countries. Its well-known brands include Pepsi-Cola, Lay's, Mountain Dew, and Doritos. The company reported impressive financial numbers from 2021 to 2023, with revenue rising from $79.5 billion to $91.5 billion over this period. Net income increased in tandem with revenue, going from $7.6 billion in 2021 to $9.1 billion in 2023.\n\nIt churned out consistent FCF over these three years, including about $6.9 billion over the trailing 12 months, and now pays a quarterly dividend of $1.355 per share, an increase of 7.1% over the previous year. The annual dividend is $5.42, for a forward dividend yield of 3.3%. This increase is the 52nd consecutive year that the company has raised its dividend.\n\nThe company looks set to continue its dividend-hiking streak based on the sturdy set of earnings for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue rose 2.3% year over year to $18.3 billion while operating income increased by 3.3% year over year to $2.7 billion. Net income for the quarter was 5.7% higher than the previous year at $2 billion.\n\nManagement is optimistic for the remainder of this year, projecting at least a 4% increase in organic revenue and an 8% increase in its earnings per share. These projections should translate into higher FCF, which should feed into further dividend increases.\n\nGenuine Parts\n\nGenuine Parts(NYSE: GPC) specializes in the distribution of automotive and industrial replacement parts. The company operates a vast network with more than 10,700 locations across 17 countries.\n\nLike PepsiCo, Genuine Parts also enjoyed steady increases in revenue and net income from 2021 to 2023. Sales went from $18.9 billion in 2021 to $23.1 billion in 2023; net income increased from $899 million to $1.3 billion over the same period. The parts distributor generated positive FCF of $1 billion per year on average over these three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA quarterly cash dividend of $1 per share capped an unbroken run of 68 years of dividend increases. The forward dividend yield is 3.1%.\n\nThe company continued to report better earnings and consistent FCF for the first quarter of this year. Sales inched up just 0.3% year over year to $5.8 billion, but net income tumbled 18.1% year over year to $249 million. A restructuring charge of $83 million dragged on its bottom line; excluding this item, net income would have risen by 9.2% year over year to $332 million.\n\nGenuine Parts carried on its tradition of healthy FCF with $202.6 million during the quarter, a surge of 85.2% year over year.\n\nThe company also made several acquisitions in the past 15 months to grow its business. In August of 2023, it acquired Gaudi, an independent automotive distribution business in Spain with 22 stores in the Catalonia and Madrid regions. In May of this year, the company bought Motor Parts and Equipment Corporation, the largest independent owner of NAPA auto parts stores in the U.S. This added another 181 locations for Genuine Parts across six states.\n\nFastenal\n\nFastenal(NASDAQ: FAST) is the largest fastener distributor in the U.S. with a large selection of construction, industrial, and safety products. The company was a steady performer from 2021 to 2023 as revenue climbed from $6 billion to $7.3 billion. Net income rose in tandem from $925 million to $1.16 billion over the same period.\n\nFastenal generated consistent FCF averaging $880 million annually over 2021 to 2023, with FCF rising each year. This growth has funded Fastenal's generous dividend payments over the years, with an annual increase every year since the company started dividends in 2011. The most recent quarterly dividend of $0.39 is up from the $0.065 paid out 13 years ago.\n\nSpecial dividends in 2008, 2012, 2020, and last year have brought the total per share paid out over the last decade to $10.15 -- against a share price around $64 today. The current annual dividend of $1.56 per share brings the forward dividend yield to 2.4%.\n\nFastenal continued to report healthy earnings growth for the first quarter of 2024. Sales ended up around 2% higher year over year at $1.9 billion for the quarter; net income inched up by 1% year over year to $297.7 million. FCF of $284.8 million was around 20% lower than the prior year's $354.8 million.\n\nSigns are pointing to higher business volumes ahead. The company reported that its annual Customer Expo in April was overbooked, with 50% more customers joining in, compared with the same period in 2023. The strong bookings reflect growing interest in Fastenal's supply chain solutions.\n\nIts digital site accounted for 59.2% of total sales for the quarter, with the long-term goal of 85%. Fastenal also saw steady growth in its physical locations, which increased from 2,851 in 2014 to 3,464 for the first quarter of 2024. This hike indicates healthy demand for its products and its growing distribution reach, both of which bode well for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Internal politics get heated at Angel City FC, Tubi CEO Anjali Sud on her rapid rise to the C-suite, and the woman who leads the Secret Service is now in the hot seat. Have a thoughtful Monday.\n\n- At your service. Before this weekend, did you know who was running the Secret Service? Her name is Kimberly Cheatle. She's a longtime veteran of the agency and a former PepsiCo security exec who got the job almost two years ago, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to her official bio, she's \"responsible for successfully executing the agency\u2019s integrated mission of protection and investigations by leading a diverse workforce composed of more than 7,800\" special agents and other personnel.\n\nOf course, Cheatle is now in the political hot seat following the shooting of former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday, which left two people dead (including the gunman) and two seriously wounded. The assassination attempt has raised questions about how the shooter got so close to succeeding; the building where he set up was outside the Secret Service's perimeter and would have been the responsibility of local law enforcement. United States Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle speaks during a press conference at the Secret Service's Chicago Field Office on June 4 2024 in Chicago, Illinois, ahead of the 2024 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI / AFP) (Photo by KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden called for an \"independent review\" of the event's security measures. Cheatle has been asked to testify at a Congressional hearing next week. The Secret Service did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nCheatle worked with the Bidens during Biden's vice presidency. She took over the Secret Service following another scandal: its preparedness for the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nShe isn't the only woman in the Secret Service coming under fire. Some critics on the right are blaming the agency's reported \"DEI\" push to hire more women for Saturday's shooting and are singling out women on Trump's security team for alleged missteps. \"DEI got someone killed,\" is how one inflammatory X post put it.\n\nAs only the second woman to run the Secret Service, Cheatle will have to answer for all of it; she'll be at the center of the storm as the investigation into the Trump assassination attempt continues.\n\nEmma Hinchliffe\r\nemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

        "title": "Yes, I'd Still Buy PepsiCo Stock Despite Q2's Revenue Miss. Here's Why.",
        "content": "There's no skirting the fact that beverage and snack producer PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) missed the mark last quarter. Although earnings rolled in better than expected, sales fell short of estimates.\n\nRevenue guidance for the remainder of the year was lackluster as well. Shares initially fell in response to Thursday morning's release of the news.\n\nBut there's a reason PepsiCo stock was bouncing back later that very day: Most investors seem to be seeing the same things I am. In fact, here's exactly why I would be a buyer of the stock despite the company's second-quarter sales shortfall.\n\nReasons for a less-than-thrilling Q2\n\nFor the three-month stretch ending in mid-June, PepsiCo turned $22.5 billion worth of revenue into an organic profit of $2.28 per share. Not bad. Sales improved 2% year over year, while earnings were up from the year-ago comparison of $2.09. Analysts were only calling for a bottom line of $2.16 per share.\n\nThe only missteps: The top line missed estimates of $22.57 billion, and the company reworded its 2024 organic revenue-growth guidance from \"at least 4%\" to just \"approximately 4% organic revenue growth.\" The market flinched, sending shares down by as much 3.3%.\n\nThe sell-off didn't last, however. The bulls were plowing back in the latter half of Thursday's trading session.\n\nMuch of the rebound can be chalked up to a deeper understanding of exactly what went wrong during the second quarter.\n\nTake the setback for its Quaker Foods division as an example. Although it's only a minor piece of PepsiCo's total business, its revenue fell 21% year over year last quarter largely due to a recall of its granola bars and cereals beginning late last year. The recall's underlying problems, however, lingered into this year. Indeed, they ultimately forced the closure of a factory in April. It's a challenge to be sure, even if only a temporary one.\n\nPepsiCo's other big headwind might not be quite as temporary. That's inflation, and the toll it's taking on consumer spending. While the second quarter's beverage sales by volume were flat year over year, its Frito-Lay snack chip business' volume slipped 4% during the second quarter due to what CEO Ramon Laguarta described as consumers becoming \"much more price conscious.\"\n\nPepsiCo is bigger than its current problems\n\nBut the stock would still be compelling even if either or both of these problems were likely to linger.\n\nThat doesn't mean the company can afford to simply ignore its current challenges. But with shares down 10% from May's peak and back to their late-2021 price, these challenges are largely already reflected in the stock's price and then some, given how Laguarta defined Frito-Lay's challenge with price-conscious consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CEO said: \"They're asking for more value, and they're willing to compromise in some of their decisions. So that's the problem to address.\"\n\nAs for the solutions, Laguarta said, \"I think once we address that situation, we'll be back in growth, and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have and the actions that we're taking, and we're quite encouraged by recent performance of the business.\"\n\nHe has a reason to feel good about the future. Frito-Lay's core brands like Doritos, Lays, Cheetos, and Tostitos are by far the best-selling chips in the U.S., and they do pretty well outside of the U.S., too.\n\nThey're also offered in multiple iterations and package sizes. Now the company is just tweaking how it gets them into consumers' hands. Although Laguarta didn't dive into the details during Thursday's earnings call, the \"tools and resources\" he mentioned are largely a reference to the digital data platform PepsiCo has been investing heavily in since 2021.\n\nAnd relief may be on the horizon. June's just-released inflation report indicates the first month-to-month dip in prices since early 2020. The factory closure linked to the company's recalls of a couple of Quaker products is also temporary.\n\nIn the meantime, newcomers would be buying PepsiCo stock while it has a forward-looking dividend yield of just over 3.3%. That's better than investors' industry-favorite Coca-Cola, which currently yields 3.1%.\n\nCoca-Cola has a slightly longer history of annual dividend increases, but with 52 consecutive years of dividend hikes, PepsiCo is certainly no slouch in this regard. Its dividend growth also has outpaced Coke's for the past 20 years, as have its stock gains.\n\nQuick: Take a sip while nobody's looking\n\nThe market is still not resoundingly bullish on PepsiCo, to be clear. It simply reversed course on Thursday's intraday sell-off. There's no serious threat of the stock suddenly racing higher without warning.\n\nInvestors simply seem to be waiting on the sidelines for a little more perspective on the company's problems, and a little more information regarding its solutions.\n\nWith shares of this resilient company already down to the degree they are, however, would-be shareholders might want to go ahead and wade in here at this low price. This is one of those scenarios where a rebound could quietly take hold and slowly pull the stock higher while nobody's looking.\n\nThis might help: Even with PepsiCo's current challenges, the analyst community's consensus price target stands at $184.08 -- more than 12% above the stock's present value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 7 Most Important Stocks to Watch as Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Off",
        "content": "Earnings season is a combination report card and progress report. The headline results tell investors what already happened. There\u2019s nothing that can be done about it. That\u2019s the report card part of it. It\u2019s the guidance a company gives that can tell investors what may be coming in future quarters. That\u2019s the progress that investors want to hear when thinking about Q2 earnings season stocks to buy.\n\nThe latest read on inflation showed a slight slowdown in the rate of growth. And many investors now believe that the Federal Reserve will start cutting rates in September with increasing optimism that there may be more than one rate cut in 2024.\n\nThe market (i.e. institutional investors) is always looking months ahead. That\u2019s one reason the market seemingly defies gravity. Those investors believe the next directional move for interest rates is lower, and they\u2019re investing accordingly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to keep up with every earnings report. But, let\u2019s examine seven Q2 earnings season stocks that investors should watch closely.\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up 150% making it one of the best-performing stocks in 2024.\u00a0However, it\u2019s listing as one the Q2 earnings season stocks to watch has less to do with the future stock price movement of NVDA stock than it does with demand for the company\u2019s chips.\n\nAs noted in the introduction, the market is becoming increasingly optimistic about a pivot by the Fed. But will businesses share this optimism? If they do, NVIDIA will be one of the beneficiaries.\n\nCompanies in every sector are racing to create artificial intelligence (AI) applications. And NVIDIA is creating the hardware that these companies need to power those applications. For much of the last 18 months, investors have shrugged off any concerns about a lofty valuation. And for the most part, the company has delivered the revenue and earnings outlook to reassure them. Investors are expecting more of the same, and that\u2019s why it will be a report to watch.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome investors will say this list of Q2 earnings season stocks to watch should simply include the magnificent seven stocks. But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be the last one to include in this group. It used to be said that as Apple goes, so goes the market. That title may now go to Nvidia, but Apple still has one of the strongest moats a company can have. That shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nAfter a rough first quarter, AAPL stock has come roaring back. The stock is up about 33% in this past quarter. The company has outlined its AI strategy. That will be showcased in its upcoming iPhone 16 launch.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, even with some analysts bidding the stock higher, Apple continues to have its share of critics. Those detractors believe this earnings report will be a prove-it moment. The iPhone 16 won\u2019t launch until September. But investors will focus closely on what Apple has to say about their manufacturing plans.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is another obvious choice as one of the stocks to watch this earnings season. In its last earnings report, the company confirmed that many consumers are cutting back on discretionary spending. It also said that it\u2019s seeing more affluent consumers choosing Walmart. And not so quietly, the company has become a digital force to be reckoned with. Global e-commerce sales were up 21% year-over-year (YOY) in the last quarter.\n\nBut earnings reports are about looking ahead. Walmart has recently announced it has opened five automated distribution centers across the U.S. These will help the country manage fresh food for its online grocery business.\n\nThe bigger story is that Walmart plans to expand this use of automation throughout its stores and fulfillment centers in the coming years. All of this will take robust capital expenditures. However, make no mistake. This will also help the company offset rising labor costs. That will be accretive to the company\u2019s earnings over time.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nOutside of AI, two of the best-performing stocks are Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and NovoNordisk (NYSE:NVO). Both companies manufacture and sell GLP-1 drugs for treating diabetes and obesity.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, Ell Lilly reported $1.8 billion in revenue for its GLP-1 diabetes drug, Mounjaro. It also reported $517 million in revenue for Zepbound, the company\u2019s GLP-1 obesity drug. LLY stock is up more than 60% for the year and 112% in the last 12 months.\n\nBut as the drugs become commonplace, it\u2019s fair to ask which company\u2019s drugs are better. A recent study suggests that Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound are producing better results for weight loss than those of Novo Nordisk. The study was not sponsored by Lilly which creates the reason for the intrigue.\n\nLilly is conducting its own head-to-head study comparing the two drugs. That will be one key point of interest for investors to watch when the company reports earnings scheduled for August 8, 2024.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to be a barometer for the economy. The company has recovered from the pandemic. But as its most recent earnings report showed, the company is having problems with difficult comparisons to last year. This reinforces investor sentiment that the consumer is tapped out.\n\nCurrently, SBUX stock is approaching its 52-week low. For all the talk that the consumer discretionary sector has hit a bottom, the stock seems to find new lows. And the earnings report from PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) won\u2019t do much to allay those fears. However, with the stock down 23% for the year, the buying pressure seems overdone.\n\nInvestors will be looking to see if that trends reverses when Starbucks reports earnings on August 6. They\u2019ll also be watching for progress on the company\u2019s \u201cSiren Craft System\u201d which is the company\u2019s initiative to alter its drink-making process to help make the job or its baristas easier. In the meantime, investors can benefit from an attractive dividend that has been growing for 14 consecutive years and has a 3.11% yield.\n\nD.R. Horton (DHI) In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerception frequently shapes reality. That\u2019s why the economy won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s on firm footing until the housing market improves. And it\u2019s why investors will pay close attention to the earnings report from D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) the largest home builder in the U.S. The report is scheduled to be released on July 18.\n\nIn early July, investors got the latest housing data. Building permits and housing starts were down YOY in May. That suggests that home builders like D.R. Horton may guide for lower revenue and earnings when they report.\n\nTight supply and high demand, particularly for first-time home buyers, should be bullish for home builders. And D.R. Horton has been beating analysts\u2019 estimates for revenue and earnings with levels well above 2019 levels. But the numbers are still coming in lower YOY. That reflects the frustration of a housing market that\u2019s navigating inflation and interest rates on both ends of the market.\n\nSLB (SLB) A zoomed in image of the logo for \"Schlumberger\" reflecting light on a smooth tan stone tiled wall.\n\nSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSLB (NYSE:SLB) is the oilfield services provider formerly known as (and still frequently referred to) as Schlumberger. Despite the fact that oil prices are higher YOY, the energy sector has been underperforming the market.\u00a0SLB has been no different. It\u2019s down 12% for the year.\n\nBut energy prices have been holding steady above $80 a barrel. And if the Fed lowers interest rates as expected, it\u2019s likely to increase demand. And with oil production already near record highs, there will be no incentive for oil companies to decrease production.\n\nThe bullish argument for SLB comes from the company\u2019s technology which is likely to add operational efficiencies to the drilling process. Furthermore, most of the company\u2019s final investment decisions have a breakeven point with oil at $50 a barrel.\n\nInvestors won\u2019t have long to wait. SLB is reporting on July 19 making it one of the first companies to report earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in AAPL.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Second-Quarter Results Just Came Out: Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For This Year",
        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) came out with its quarterly results last week, and we wanted to see how the business is performing and what industry forecasters think of the company following this report. It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$23b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.23 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that PepsiCo is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on PepsiCo after the latest results.\n\nSee our latest analysis for PepsiCo  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, PepsiCo's 20 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$93.9b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 14% to US$7.92. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$94.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.86 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$182, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on PepsiCo, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$200 and the most bearish at US$151 per share. With such a narrow range of valuations, the analysts apparently share similar views on what they think the business is worth.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that PepsiCo's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 4.0% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 8.0% p.a. growth over the last five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 4.7% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while PepsiCo's revenue growth is expected to slow, it's expected to grow roughly in line with the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$182, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have forecasts for PepsiCo going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\n\nBefore you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that we have uncovered.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Compelling Consumer Staples Stocks to Add to Your July Buy List",
        "content": "As market volatility persists in 2024 with the presidential election on the horizon, investors look towards more stable investments. Consumer staples stocks are a reliable choice for those seeking to navigate these turbulent times.\n\nThese stocks represent companies that produce and sell essential goods and services, such as food, beverages, household products and personal care items. This makes investing in the sector extremely attractive, as companies can generate consistent revenue and cash flows. Moreover, the companies tend to have a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. For income-focused investors, this is a significant advantage, as it provides a reliable source of passive income.\n\nGiven the defensive nature of the industry, now could be a great time to consider adding these giants to your investment portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the top three consumer staples stocks to add to your July buy list.\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ)\n\nMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a global snacking powerhouse, boasting a diversified portfolio of iconic brands such as Oreo, Cadbury and Trident. The company\u2019s strong market position makes it a compelling choice for investors looking for reliable consumer staples stocks.\n\nMondelez has consistently delivered strong financial performance over the last few years. The company\u2019s strong brand recognition and growth strategy through acquisitions has paid significant dividends. It continues to acquire high-profile brands, including the acquisition of leading U.S. energy bar maker, Clif Bar & Company. Additionally, its commitment to sustainability coupled with its robust supply chain network enables it to manage costs efficiently. This has allowed the company to scale organically and maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace.\n\nIn FY23, Mondelez saw record revenue of $36.01 billion, an increase of 14% year over year. Moreover, its net earnings swelled 82% year over year to $4.95 billion. But the cherry on top was the company increasing its dividend by 10% and returning $3.7 billion to shareholders.\n\nHershey (HSY)\n\nHershey (NYSE:HSY) is a leading confectionery company with a rich history and strong portfolio of brands, including Hershey\u2019s, Reese\u2019s and Kit Kat. Known for its high-quality products, Hershey is an emerging consumer staples stock that truly does not get the love it deserves.\n\nThe Hershey brand has been around for more than a century, showcasing its ability to navigate through an array of economic cycles. It has continued to innovate and expand its products beyond traditional chocolate. This includes its foray into the healthy snack segment. Moreover, its growing presence in international markets, particularly in Asia, is a noble strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven amidst record-high cacao prices, Hershey\u2019s healthy profit margins are a testament to management\u2019s strong execution. In the 2023 fiscal year, revenue increased 7% year over year to a record $11.16 billion. Additionally, net earnings rose 13% year-over-year to $1.86 billion while generating $1.55 billion in free cash flow. The company\u2019s dividend is also growing rapidly, placing it among the best consumer staples stocks to snap up in Q3 2024.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP)\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), a global food and beverage giant, is the final company on this list for the top consumer staples stocks to buy in 2024. The company consistently delivered strong financial results over the last decade. Additionally, its focus on innovation, strong brand recognition and expansion into new markets enhances its long-term appeal.\n\nOne of PepsiCo\u2019s key strengths is its ability to cater to a wide range of consumer preferences. It has a diversified portfolio of brands across various categories, including carbonated soft drinks, juices, snacks and breakfast items. Furthermore, it has also embraced healthier food options, acquiring notable brands like Health Warrior and Naked. This move has significantly enhanced the company\u2019s competitive edge.\n\nIn FY23, the company saw record revenue, earnings and free cash flow. The Latin American market reported significant gains, with operating profit up 67% from the year prior. Its valuation is also still quite attractive and it recently raised its dividend by 7% to a record $1.355 per share. Despite weaker demand and volume in domestic markets, its 4% revenue and 8% EPS guidance for FY24 make the stock extremely compelling.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "One snack giant has finally admitted that $6 for a bag of Cheetos is crumbling consumers\u2019 wallets.\n\nAfter multiple years of raising prices for consumers, PepsiCo\u2019s snack unit Frito-Lay is finally feeling them bite back. The company\u2014which produces most of America\u2019s chip favorites, including Doritos, Ruffles, and Lay's\u2014reported a 0.5% decline in second quarter revenues Thursday. The drop comes after Frito-Lay saw its net revenues soar roughly $7 billion between 2020 and 2023.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nYears of persistent inflation have created \u201ctighter household financial conditions,\u201d PepsiCo management said in prepared remarks. Now, as customers have become more \u201cvalue-conscious,\u201d the snack giant\u2019s performance is \u201csubdued.\u201d\n\nUpon this realization, Frito-Lay intends to cut prices for some salty snacks and expand marketing for others, PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a call to investors.\n\n\u201cThere is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation,\u201d Laguarta added.\n\nFrito-Lay will utilize a now familiar play to win back consumers, Laguarta said: investing in value-based deals. Multiple food retailers, from fast food to grocery stores, have begun offering deals in recent weeks to attract value-seeking customers. Like McDonald\u2019s new $5 meal, or Whole Foods' $2 Tuesday rotisserie chickens, Frito-Lay is ready to jump on the trend of bargaining with its customers.\n\n\u201cIt seems that customers are gravitating toward where they feel the best deal is right now,\u201d Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel previously told Fortune.\n\nLaguarta, in response to multiple peppering comments from investors Thursday, agreed, admitting that \u201cnew entry points\u201d and \u201cnew promotional kind of mechanics\u201d would be necessary for consumers.\n\nSome consumers might say that it\u2019s about time. The average price of potato chips in June 2024 was $6.56\u2014a near 30% jump from the June 2020 pandemic price of $5.09, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just potato chips\u2014more than 80% of consumers say that overall, food prices have increased a little or a lot over the past 12 months, according to the May 2024 Consumer Food Insights Report from Purdue University. The same report found 37% of chip-loving Gen Zers and millennials say they are going into debt, or whittling away their savings, to pay for food.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cfood\u201d was the top choice over categories like housing and childcare when consumers were asked which goods and services saw the largest year-over-year price increase.\n\nThe White House contests the impact of inflation on food prices, making the case that consumer purchasing power at grocery stores has actually increased. Grocery inflation has cooled in recent months, according to a recent White House report. And, if you narrow the scope to just the past year, at-home food prices have increased by only 1%, according to the Consumer Price Index, while wages grew by about 3.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, that data ignores the years of persistent price increases from compounding inflation; since 2021, groceries are about 25% more expensive.\n\n\u201cThe reason consumers feel like prices are increasing is because they still are,\u201d Kendall Meade, a certified financial planner at SoFi, previously told Fortune. \u201cWhile inflation may be slowing down, it has not stopped and we are not seeing disinflation.\u201d\n\nHowever, falling revenues may be the wake-up call food retailers need to offer permanent price decreases, beyond promotional deals.\n\nOver the past six months, food companies such as Conagra\u2014which dominates the frozen meals section at grocery sections\u2014have tried to use temporary discounts to woo customers, Bank of America analyst Peter Galbo told the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBut a lot of the promotional activity that they\u2019ve put in place hasn\u2019t really worked,\u201d Galbo said. \u201cSo now it becomes a question of whether they need more permanent reductions on price.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Are Pepsico's Earnings Good News For Its Dividend Future?",
        "content": "Are Pepsico's Earnings Good News For Its Dividend Future?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nIf you are looking for a salty snack or a cool drink, you might have a PepsiCo product in your hand. The global beverages and snacks conglomerate has also provided plenty of refreshments for dividend investors. It is a dividend aristocrat with 53 years of consecutive dividend increases. It has a forward dividend yield of 3.31% and an annual dividend of $5.42. In the most recent quarter, it returned $8.2 billion to shareholders, $7.2 billion of that\u00a0 in dividends.\n\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that the dividend is in jeopardy, it's worth reviewing recent earnings to see what we can learn about where Pepsico's growth may come from next. The company delivered 13% earnings per share growth as it reduced its cost of sales, but organic growth was up by less than 2%, down sharply year over year.\n\nSnacking Less\n\nOne immediate concern is a weakness in North American convenience food purchases. The Frito-Lay North America division was down by 0.5%. The Quaker Oats division was down by 18%, much of that driven by the effect of a large recall of bars and other products. The company expects to meet rather than exceed a 4% revenue growth target for the full year.\n\nWith stratospheric inflation hopefully in the rearview mirror, it's unlikely that PepsiCo will need to, or be able to, increase prices significantly anytime soon. Like many other consumer goods companies, it has raised prices in recent quarters but now sees that snackers have scaled back their consumption of Frito-Lay products. The market was aware of this issue before the earnings release, and four analysts lowered their price targets for the stock\u2019s future in July alone.\n\nSome of this drop could merely be price sensitivity, but we can't rule out the potential for changes in behavior. On the earnings call, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said that the company has not seen a significant impact from the rapid adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs but that it is something the company is monitoring.\n\nGiven that most of the adoption of these drugs is heavily concentrated in the U.S. and the decrease in the volume of Frito-Lay product sales appears to be occurring around the world, it is likely that something else is causing the decline in snacking. However, the company is paying more attention to permissible foods, such as brands like PopCorners and SunChips, which are perceived as healthier options.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaguarta stated that while plain potato and tortilla chips may need some price adjustments, new flavors are performing well. This indicates that pricing strategies and flavor development are key to snacking success.\n\nCan you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors.\n\nBeyond The Fizz\n\nLike Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), while Pepsi is the brand most associated with the company, its future growth is unlikely to come from it. The company is seeing large strides in functional water. Laguarta pointed out that both Gatorade and Propel are taking market share.\n\nBut don't rule out carbonated beverages yet. The expansion of the Mountain Dew brand into new flavors has resonated with consumers, and the company also plans to expand its zero-sugar offerings. Its partnership with Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) and its company brands in the space also expose it to the resilient energy drinks market.\n\nA Global Focus\n\nSpeaking to analysts, Laguarta noted that Pepsi's future remains an international story. The company has seen China's consumers be cautious about spending but still sees potential in that area. Net revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region was up 1% in the quarter. In Latin America, net revenue growth was up by 2%, driven by increased beverage volume. Europe remained strong, and the company's overall international organic net revenue growth was 7%. Laguarta is also looking to other emerging markets to find new customers.\n\nWhile Pepsico's quarter was not exactly what many investors hoped to see, the company clearly has a strategy to address the weakness in the snack foods division while powering forward with new beverage offerings.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 12, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses The Coca-Cola Co. KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF and Vita Coco Co. COCO.\n\nIndustry: Soft Drinks\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2299710/5-soft-drink-stocks-poised-to-thrive-in-a-growing-industry\n\nParticipants in the Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry are positioned for long-term market share growth through innovation, adaptability and a focus on consumer well-being. Increasing digital investments in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels are beneficial. Key trends such as health consciousness, sustainability and innovation are driving the industry.\n\nIts participants are expected to benefit from expanding into new and adjacent categories, including gaining market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Monster Beverage Corp., Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. and Vita Coco Co. are poised for growth on these strategies.\n\nHowever, industry players are facing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly for steel and aluminum. Actions such as price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets appear promising to combat these challenges. Additionally, elevated operating expenses due to increased marketing and advertising spending to capture market share are expected to strain margins in the short term.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages.\n\nSome industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?\n\nEvolving Trends: A significant trend in the U.S. soft drinks industry is the rising demand for healthier options. As consumers become more health-conscious, there is a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, in addition to offering varied flavors and better taste experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlant-based beverages are gaining traction as alternatives to traditional soft drinks, with botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives becoming popular among those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that provide specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters and mood enhancers, are creating a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are poised to benefit from expanding into new and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the rapidly growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations.\n\nInnovation & Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is experiencing a surge in flavor and format variety, driven by consumer demand for unique and exotic taste experiences. The sector stands to benefit from ongoing innovations and increased digital investments.\n\nCompanies are optimizing their portfolios by focusing on core brands and investing in innovation to meet evolving consumer needs. They remain committed to product launches and innovation, with expansion into new markets being a key strategy for increasing market share.\n\nDigital and technology-driven investments are expected to pay off as consumer preferences shift toward online shopping. Industry players are accelerating their efforts to build robust digital capabilities, piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options, and expanding digital offerings. Investments in loyalty programs are also being made to capture online demand. These strategies are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.\n\nRaw Material Cost Inflation & Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is troubled with higher costs, including increased commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Packaging costs have risen due to raw material cost inflation, particularly, steel and aluminum. Ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry pose further challenges.\n\nIndustry players continue to deal with freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. These logistical issues, accompanied by higher input costs, have resulted in higher operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins.\n\nMost companies expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist through the near term. In response, price increases to counter these cost pressures have significantly boosted sales in recent quarters.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #90, which places it in the top 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

        "content": "Paige Bueckers and Candace Parker Present Highest Honor in High School Sports to Nation's Top Athletes\n\nLOS ANGELES, July 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Tonight, Gatorade named Sadie Engelhardt and Cooper Flagg as the 2023-24 Gatorade Best Female and Best Male Players of the Year, distinguishing the duo as the best high school athletes in the nation.

        "title": "PepsiCo CEO: GLP-1 drugs are 'not impacting us'",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta said GLP-1 drugs for weight loss and diabetes, such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, aren't yet having an effect on the business.\n\nIn the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday, Laguarta attributed softer sales in the quarter to a consumer behavioral shift, saying consumers have become more value-conscious, \u201ccautious,\u201d and \u201cchoiceful\u201d in their purchases.\n\n\u201cI don't think GLP at this point \u2026 has a material impact in our category for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of panels and we have a lot of conversations with consumers. It's not impacting us.\u201d Pepsi restocks the famed vending machine at Pittsburgh\u2019s Fire Station 27 on May 3, 2022, in Pittsburgh, Pa. (Justin Merriman/Getty Images for Pepsi) (Justin Merriman via Getty Images)\n\nThe demand for GLP-1 drugs has skyrocketed. In 2023, Novo Nordisk\u2019s diabetes and weight-loss drugs \u2014 Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy \u2014 brought in $21 billion in sales, an 89% increase over the year prior. That has led some on Wall Street to anticipate a looming threat for food and beverage companies should consumers cut back on salty snacks, though others have pushed back, saying the outlook isn't so dire.\n\nWhile less than 1% of the US population is currently taking GLP-1s for weight loss, a Morgan Stanley study in late 2023 projected that 25 million to 50 million Americans may be taking these drugs by 2030. The projected increase in GLP-1 use could lead to a 1% to 3% decrease in the national calorie intake, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s report.\n\nWith the food category contributing 59% of PepsiCo's net revenue last year, the company could see the effects of weight-loss drugs in the future, something executives are monitoring.

(Jens Kalaene/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)\n\nPepsiCo reported revenue of $22.5 billion for the second quarter, slightly below estimates of $22.59 billion, while earnings beat estimates at $2.28 per share. Impacted by both the Quaker Foods recall and a more value-conscious consumer, the amount of food product sold in the second quarter was down 2% compared to last year.\n\n\"We feel that the issue is an issue of value,\" Laguarta said. \"It's not an issue of anything else.\"\n\nLaguarta explained that the company is facing the effects of inflation and its impact on consumer mindset.\n\n\u201cI know that for many categories, the multiple-year inflation that we had to take because our input costs went up has created some perception and some reality in a lot of households that food is expensive,\u201d Laguarta said. \u201cNow that our costs are kind of normalizing, ... how do we deploy those resources against what are the best levers to reignite growth? And again, it will not be a blanket approach. It will be a segmented approach.\u201d\n\n\"This is not just a PepsiCo problem,\" RBC Capital Markets managing director Nik Modi told Yahoo Finance about the toll of inflation. \"This is a problem for the entire snacking industry. And, quite frankly, the entire packaged food industry is under a lot of pressure.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nLaguarta expressed confidence in Pepsi's ability to regain customers by offering value through promotions, pricing, marketing, and innovation. \"There is nothing in terms of consumer long-term trends that tells us that that's not possible,\" Laguarta said.\n\n\"As we get through this earnings season, it\u2019s going to be very evident that packaged food companies are going to have to spend more money than they originally thought to really drive volume in this current environment,\" Modi noted.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Tech Stocks Tumble As Small Caps, REITs, Gold Miners Rally; Soft June Inflation Ignites Rate Cut Expectations: What's Driving Markets Thursday?\n\nA lower-than-expected inflation report for June caused wild market reactions, leading to a surge in traders\u2019 expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and boosting assets that are particularly sensitive to high interest rates.\n\nAs the annual inflation rate slowed from 3.3% to 3%, below the predicted 3.1%, and the monthly reading indicated the first contraction (-0.1%) in four years, traders swiftly increased their odds of a September rate cut, now placing a 92% chance.\n\nSurprisingly, large-cap indices such as the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index fell, dropping 0.9% and 2.1% respectively, with the latter eyeing its worst daily performance of 2024, previously seen on April 30. These reactions suggest that market participants had likely already priced in rate cut expectations into tech stock valuations and are now rotating from top-performing sectors to laggards.\n\nThe outperformance of the S&P 500 real estate sector over tech by more than 5 percentage points marked the largest one-day relative change in over four years, indicating a potential sectoral shift.\n\nOther assets making significant moves included small caps, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) up 3.3%, its strongest one-day return since mid-December 2023; gold, up 1.7%; and long-dated Treasury bonds, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) rallying 1.5%.\n\nEquity industries showing notable growth were those positively impacted by the prospects of lower interest rates. Homebuilders, tracked by the SPDR Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB), were up 6.7% for the day, their strongest one-day performance since mid-December 2023. Regional banks, represented by the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE), rose 3.4%. Gold miners, tracked by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), climbed 2.4%, on track for their highest close since April 2022.\n\nBitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was flat at $57,800.\n\nThursday\u2019s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices  Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,120.27 3.4% Dow Jones 39,754.72 0.1 % S&P 500 5,583.95 -0.9% Nasdaq 100 20,246.76 -2.1%\n\nUpdated at 1:05 PM ET\n\nAccording to\u00a0Benzinga Pro\u00a0data:\n\nThe\u00a0SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY)\u00a0was 0.9% lower to $556.201. The\u00a0SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA)\u00a0inched 0.1% higher to $397.59. The tech-heavy\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA:\u00a0QQQ) tumbled 2.1% to $492.83. Sector-wise, the\u00a0Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE)\u00a0outperformed, up by 2.5%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) lagged, falling 2.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThursday\u2019s Stock Movers\n\nTesla Inc. (TSLA) fell over 6%, after Bloomberg flagged delays in the Robitaxi project. Top-performers within real estate stocks were Communications Corporation (NYSE:SBA) Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (NYSE:ARE), both up 6.5%. PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) was 0.4% higher, following quarterly earnings. Other stocks reacting to earnings were Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL), ConAgra Brands Inc. (NYSE:CAG), up 0.4% and down 2% respectively. Caesars Entertainment Inc.

        "content": "By Jessica DiNapoli and Ananya Mariam Rajesh\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said Thursday there is \"much more price sensitivity\" across U.S. income groups and not just low-income consumers, highlighting its sensitivity to broad shifts in consumer demand.\n\nThe Diet Pepsi and Tostitos tortilla chips maker, which fell short of Wall Street expectations for revenue for its second quarter Thursday, said consumers continued to face a squeeze from rising prices and constrained wages.\n\n\"They're saying 'There's been a lot of inflation and my disposable income is stretched,'\" Laguarta said in an interview. \"It's not only the lower-income consumer, it's throughout.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCompanies like PepsiCo hiked prices by double digits during and after the pandemic to recoup once-in-a-generation levels of cost inflation. On Thursday, the New York-based company said it had raised prices by 5% overall in the most recent quarter ended June 15, helping protect its margins which rose compared with a year before.\n\nCosts have started to come down, with U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly falling in June. But some costs, like agricultural commodities, remain elevated, PepsiCo said Thursday in prepared remarks.\n\nLaguarta had said in April that lower-income consumers were \"stretched\" and \"strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month.\"\n\nIn a call with analysts Thursday, he said higher-income consumers were skipping meals at expensive restaurants and dining at cheaper ones instead, or opting out of them altogether for at-home entertainment options.\n\n\"Once we address that situation, we'll be back in growth, and we feel pretty good about the tools and the resources we have,\" Laguarta said.\n\nPepsiCo is investing in parts of its Frito-Lay North America business, its second-largest after beverages, to keep consumers buying its popcorn, potato and tortilla chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also looking to cut costs and make its business more efficient, Laguarta said.\n\nBrian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said: \"Consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices. Last year the consumer was told to just be quiet and accept higher prices. Now they're fed up.\n\n\"Wage gains are okay, but they're not great, so consumers are rebelling by cutting back on non-essentials and shopping around for everything else,\" Jacobsen added. \"It's not a trend that's anything to worry about. It's just a return to prudence instead of profligacy.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bangalore; Editing by David Holmes)",

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Q2 Earnings Beat, Soft QFNA Results Hurt Stock",
        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. PEP has reported robust second-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues lagged. However, the top and bottom lines improved year over year. The company\u2019s results have mainly been aided by improvements in its international business, which delivered significant volume growth and organic revenue growth of 5.5% year over year. The international business also reported 10% core operating profit growth and strong core operating margin expansion.\r\n\r\nThe results also reflect gains from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends.\r\n\r\nShares of PepsiCo declined 1.9% in the pre-market session on Jul 11, as results have continued to be impacted by QFNA\u2019s recall-related headwinds and soft performance at the North America convenient foods businesses. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 2.7% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s 2.6% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s second-quarter core EPS of $2.28 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 and increased 9% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 10% from the year-ago period. The company\u2019s reported EPS of $2.23 rose 13% year over year in the quarter. Foreign currency impacted EPS by 1%.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $22.5 million rose 0.8% year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.6 billion. Revenues were negatively impacted by subdued category demand within its North America convenient foods businesses. Unit volume was down 2% for the convenient food business and was flat for the beverage business. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 1%.\r\n\r\nOn an organic basis, revenues grew 1.9% year over year, significantly below organic revenue growth of 13% in second-quarter 2023. The variance mainly resulted from a soft QFNA performance, which was impacted by certain product recalls. The QFNA segment revenues reduced organic revenue growth by 60 basis points (bps) in second-quarter 2024.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nThe company\u2019s consolidated organic volume was down 3%, while effective net pricing improved 5% in the second quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments, except for QFNA.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted year-over-year organic revenue growth of 2.8% for the second quarter, with a 4.5% gain from price/mix and a 1.7% decline in volume.\r\n\r\nOn a consolidated basis, the reported gross profit increased 3.1% year over year to $12.58 billion. The core gross profit rose 3% year over year to $12.57 million. The reported gross margin expanded 126 bps, whereas the core gross margin expanded by 120 bps.\r\n\r\nWe anticipated the core gross margin to expand 20 bps year over year to 54.9% in the second quarter. In dollar terms, core gross profit was expected to increase 2% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company reported an operating income of $4.05 billion, which rose 10.6% year over year. The core operating income grew 6.8% year over year to $4.12 billion. The core constant-currency operating income also improved 7% year over year. The reported operating margin expanded 160 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 103 bps, driven by holistic productivity initiatives, offset by planned business investments.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted core SG&A expenses of $8.6 billion, which indicated year-over-year growth of 2.8%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses were anticipated to be 37.9%, suggesting a 50-bps rise from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expected a core operating margin of 17.1%, implying a 20-bps decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegmental Details\n\nThe company witnessed revenue growth on a reported basis across most of the operating segments, except for QFNA, FLNA and APAC. Revenues in the QFNA segment were impacted by certain product recalls and tough revenue growth comparisons with the prior year. FLNA revenues were partly marred by subdued category demand in the convenient foods business.\r\n\r\nRevenues on a reported basis improved 1% year over year in PBNA, 7% in Latin America, 2.5% in Europe, and 2% in the AMESA segment. However, reported revenues declined 0.5% at FLNA, 18% at QFNA and 2% at the APAC segment.\r\n\r\nPEP\u2019s organic revenues improved across all operating segments, except for QFNA. Organic revenues were flat for FLNA, and rose 1% for PBNA, 2% for Latin America, 7% for Europe, 12% for AMESA and 1% for the APAC segment. However, organic revenues declined 18% for the QFNA segment.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe company ended second-quarter 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 billion, long-term debt of $36.6 billion, and shareholders\u2019 equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $19.4 billion.\r\n\r\nNet cash used in operating activities was $1.3 billion as of Jun 15, 2024, compared with $2 billion as of Jun 17, 2023.\n\nOutlook\n\nPepsiCo has revised its view for 2024. The company expects year-over-year organic revenue growth of 4% for 2024, compared with the prior view of at least 4%. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nBased on the current rates, PEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and the core EPS by 1 percentage point in 2024. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2024.\r\n\r\nGiven the above assumption, PepsiCo expects a core EPS of at least $8.15 for 2024. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $7.62 reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return a value worth $8.2 billion in 2024, including $7.2 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1 billion in 2024.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss These Better-Ranked Stocks\n\nWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Vita Coco Company COCO, Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF and J & J Snack Foods JJSF.\r\n\r\nVita Coco currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). COCO shares have rallied 20.4% in the past three months. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.3%, on average. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vita Coco\u2019s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 3.5% and 40.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figures.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola FEMSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). KOF shares have declined 12.3% in the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola FEMSA\u2019s current financial-year sales and EPS suggests growth of 11.9% and 26.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figures. KOF has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 1.3%, on average.\r\n\r\nJ & J Snack currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. JJSF shares have gained 24.2% in the past three months. JJSF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.7%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for J & J Snack\u2019s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 1.6% and 17.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period's reported figures.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Pepsi Reported Rising Profits But Demand Continues To Shrink At Its Home Market",
        "content": "Pepsi Reported Rising Profits But Demand Continues To Shrink At Its Home Market\n\nBefore the markets opened on Thursday. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) issued its second quarter financials. While earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, revenue came short as\u00a0its three North American business units reported a declining volume.\u00a0In addition, Pepsi was more cautious with its full-year sales outlook. As a result, its\u00a0shares were down 1.7% during premarket trading.\n\nOne of its rivals one the global snacks and beverages front, Mondelez International (NASDAQ: MDLZ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal second quarter earnings on Thursday, July 25th. Over the last four quarters, Mondelez has consecutively surpassed earnings estimates. But Mondelez, known as the Oreo and Cadbury maker, was also fined $366 million a month ago for rigging European markets. More precisely, the EU regulators found that since 2016, Mondelez has been\u00a0hindering the trade of chocolate, cookies and coffee between European Union countries in order maintain high prices of its products. Mondelez has been deliberately limiting cross-border sales within the EU, abusing its dominant position. Responding to the commission who found its illegal practices\u00a0prevented retailers from being able to freely source products in the EU member states with lower prices, Mondelez spokesperson stated that the penalty related to isolated incidents which were\u00a0remedied before the commission started the investigation.\n\nAnother industry peer, Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE: STZ) reported its May quarter financials.\u00a0\u00a0Constellation Brands continued to beat profit estimates despite delivering a mixed report. Unlike PepsiCo, Constellation Brands reported beer that had its fourteenth consecutive quarter of growth with demand rising 8.3% due to wider consumption. However, Constellation Brands is also struggling with a weakness on one of its fronts, namely wine and spirits whose sales contracted by 5.1% YoY. Fortunately for Constellation, the sluggish demand from wines and spirits was compensated by consumers switching to beer. The beer business made more than 80% of the latest quarter\u2019s revenue that Constellation Brands reported.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s Second Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on June 15th, PepsiCo reported net sales rose almost 1% to $22.5 billion, which was short of LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$22.57 billion. Fueled by international operations, organic revenue that excludes acquisitions, divestitures and currency changes, actually grew 1.9%.\n\nBut net income attributable to the company amounted to $3.08 billion\u00a0or $2.23 per share, rising from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when PepsiCo earned\u00a0$2.75 billion, or $1.99 per share. When adjusted, earnings per share amounted to $2.28, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$2.16.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsi got\u00a0hurt by declining demand at its home market.\n\nIn North America,\u00a0financials were hurt\u00a0by safety product recalls and shrinking product demand as years of price increases led consumers to buy fewer of PepsiCo\u2019s products and switch to cheaper alternatives. Frito-Lay North America, the company\u2019s second largest business after the beverages unit, reported a volume decrease of 4%,\u00a0while the\u00a0beverage unit reported a decrease of 3%. Quaker Foods North America continues to deal with food safety recalls for potential salmonella contamination that was issued in December and January, with its volume shrinking by 17%.\n\nA More Cautious Outlook\n\nWhile PepsiCo previously guided for organic revenue growth of at least 4%, it now expects approximately 4%. But it reiterated its core constant currency earnings growth outlook of at least 8%.\n\nOn a brighter note, international demand remained strong despite the price increases. But in the U.S., its largest market, PepsiCo is facing increased competition from private-label brands.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "CPI, Jobless Claims Brings Goldilocks Scenario",
        "content": "Thursday, July 11th, 2024\r\n\r\nPre-market futures leaped into the green immediately upon new data released this morning. The long-awaited Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for June is out, and results \u2014 from the perspective that they lead the Fed toward softening interest rates in the near future \u2014 could not have been better. Headline CPI month over month dipped to -0.1%, the first negative print going all the way back to May 2020. Normally we don\u2019t like to see negative growth in the economy, but helping lead to a rate cut? Mwah!\r\n\r\nYear-over-year headline CPI is also known as the Inflation Rate. As such, it is among the very most important economic reads we have. For June, the Inflation Rate came in at +3.0%, 10 basis points (bps) lower than expected and 30 bps lower month over month. This is also less than a third of what we saw two years ago: a +9.1% Inflation Rate in June of 2022. It\u2019s also the slimmest Inflation Rate we\u2019ve seen since March 2021 \u2014 back when inflation was going the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nCore CPI strips out volatile food and energy costs. This morning\u2019s print also came in lower than expected: +0.1% versus the +0.2% consensus and previous month, and the lightest number since June 2021, three years ago exactly. Core CPI year over year reached +3.3%, below the +3.4% expected and prior monthly figure. This is the lowest core inflation print since April of 2021. In short, all of this data illustrates that a high Fed funds rate for the past year has (so far) worked like a charm.\r\n\r\nThat said, those pre-market green shoots have turned to red. Perhaps market participants have applied the brakes because valuations have already priced in much of this good news. (And if you were one of those who correctly prognosticated Goldilocks CPI numbers this morning, feel free to give yourself a pat on the back.) At a glance, this looks to be a cash-out move, booking profits in light of very welcome economic news.\r\n\r\nInitial Jobless Claims are also out this morning. These reverted back to levels we haven\u2019t seen since May: 222K on headline for the week, down -17K from the previous week\u2019s lightly upwardly revised 239K. Continuing Claims remained at high points of the year, but have drifted down slightly from 1.856 million in last week\u2019s report to 1.85 million this week. We\u2019re clearly seeing a softening labor market from historic levels over the past year or two; this is part of the Fed\u2019s plan for loosening the economy enough to reduce rates, as well.\r\n\r\nDelta Air Lines DAL unofficially kicks off Q2 earnings season this morning. The major airline carrier missed estimates by a penny on its bottom line, with earnings of $2.36 per share, and down from $2.68 a year ago. Revenues, on the other hand, improved over expectations: $16.66 billion versus $16.25 billion, for a positive top-line surprise of +2.5%. That said, lower booking rates have brought net income down -30%, leading to a sell-off of -8.6% in today\u2019s pre-market. For more on DAL\u2019s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo PEP also reported Q2 earnings head of today\u2019s open. Earnings of $2.28 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of $2.15 (and the year-ago figure of $2.09 per share). However, the soft drinks and snacks giant missed by a smidge of its top line, with revenues of $22.5 billion -0.25% shy of the $22.56 billion anticipated. Weakening demand in the U.S. is sending these shares lower on the news, as well: the stock is down -2.8%, adding to the -3.7% loss year to date.

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) reported $22.5 billion in revenue for the quarter ended June 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.8%. EPS of $2.28 for the same period compares to $2.09 a year ago.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of -0.25% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.56 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.15, the EPS surprise was +6.05%.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how PepsiCo performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nNet revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region: $1.10 billion versus the three-analyst average estimate of $1.12 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of -2.1%. Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America: $5.87 billion versus $5.91 billion estimated by three analysts on average.

        "title": "5 Soft Drink Stocks Poised to Thrive in a Growing Industry",
        "content": "Participants in the Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry are positioned for long-term market share growth through innovation, adaptability and a focus on consumer well-being. Increasing digital investments in e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels are beneficial. Key trends such as health consciousness, sustainability and innovation are driving the industry. Its participants are expected to benefit from expanding into new and adjacent categories, including gaining market share in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF and Vita Coco Company COCO are poised for growth on these strategies.\r\n\r\nHowever, industry players are facing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly for steel and aluminum. Actions such as price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets appear promising to combat these challenges. Additionally, elevated operating expenses due to increased marketing and advertising spending to capture market share are expected to strain margins in the short term.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?\n\nEvolving Trends: A significant trend in the U.S. soft drinks industry is the rising demand for healthier options. As consumers become more health-conscious, there is a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, in addition to offering varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages are gaining traction as alternatives to traditional soft drinks, with botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives becoming popular among those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that provide specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters and mood enhancers, are creating a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are poised to benefit from expanding into new and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the rapidly growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations.\r\n\r\nInnovation & Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is experiencing a surge in flavor and format variety, driven by consumer demand for unique and exotic taste experiences. The sector stands to benefit from ongoing innovations and increased digital investments. Companies are optimizing their portfolios by focusing on core brands and investing in innovation to meet evolving consumer needs. They remain committed to product launches and innovation, with expansion into new markets being a key strategy for increasing market share. Digital and technology-driven investments are expected to pay off as consumer preferences shift toward online shopping. Industry players are accelerating their efforts to build robust digital capabilities, piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options, and expanding digital offerings. Investments in loyalty programs are also being made to capture online demand. These strategies are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nRaw Material Cost Inflation & Supply Constraints: The beverage industry is troubled with higher costs, including increased commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Packaging costs have risen due to raw material cost inflation, particularly, steel and aluminum. Ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry pose further challenges. Industry players continue to deal with freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. These logistical issues, accompanied by higher input costs, have resulted in higher operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins. Most companies expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist through the near term. In response, price increases to counter these cost pressures have significantly boosted sales in recent quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #90, which places it in the top 36% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

        "title": "PepsiCo Sales Disappoint as US Consumers Cut Back on Snacks",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. reported weaker-than-expected revenue growth as its snack-food business was hurt by increasingly budget-focused shoppers and a recent Quaker Foods recall.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat Archegos\u2019 Bill Hwang Convicted of Fraud, Market Manipulation Biden Aides to Meet Senators After Pelosi Remarks Deal Blow NATO Singles Out China Over Its Support for Russia in Ukraine Modi\u2019s Embrace of Putin Irks Biden Team Pushing Support for Kyiv\n\nThe maker of Doritos chips and Mountain Dew sodas said Thursday that organic revenue rose 1.9% in the second quarter, missing the 2.9% average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The volume of food products sold in the period was down 2% from a year earlier, including steeper drops for the Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods businesses in North America.\n\nAfter years of price increases and sales growth, PepsiCo\u2019s US business is struggling. Persistent inflation has forced many shoppers to cut back on spending and switch to cheaper supermarket-owned brands. The salty snacks category has been particularly lackluster as consumers focus more on nutrition and affordability.\n\n\u201cPrice hikes have become increasingly difficult for consumers to stomach, pushing volumes in the wrong direction,\u201d said Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nPepsiCo shares fell 1.6% in New York in early trading at 7:58 a.m. The stock had fallen 11% over the past 12 months, compared with a 7% gain in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index and a 6% gain in shares of rival Coca-Cola Co.\n\nIn North America, PepsiCo volumes fell in both food and beverages. The company remains impacted by the large recall of Quaker Oats cereals, bars and snacks that began late last year. Volume was down 17% in the Quaker Foods division from a year ago.\n\nInternationally, PepsiCo fared better with organic sales up across the board, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. Organic revenue in Latin America and Asia Pacific grew 2% and 1%, respectively, but fell short of analyst estimates as food volumes shrank.\n\nPepsiCo plans to improve productivity and focus \u201csurgically\u201d on promotions, while increasing certain advertising and marketing initiatives, Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said in a statement. The company said it expects that consumers will remain budget conscious and overall category growth will moderate.\n\n\u201cThe group will have to lean into cost-cutting and productivity initiatives in order to offset some of the impacts of lower volumes and keep profit targets on track in the short term,\u201d Chiekrie said in a research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nConagra Brands Inc. also highlighted lower consumption trends and productivity initiatives in its earnings release Thursday. Other packaged food makers such as General Mills Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co. have also been focusing on productivity as a way to improve margins in the face of sluggish sales growth.\n\nFood is an increasingly big part of PepsiCo\u2019s business, accounting for 59% of global revenue in 2023.\n\nThe Purchase, New York-based company reiterated most aspects of its full-year forecast aside from now targeting organic revenue growth of 4% for the year compared with \u201cat least 4%\u201d previously.\n\nCore earnings per share were $2.28 for the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.15. The company hasn\u2019t missed quarterly profit estimates in more than 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with additional details throughout.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Retirement Stocks to Buy in July 2024",
        "content": "Investing in retirement takes some forethought and planning. Stocks need to offer both growth and protection for investors in their twilight years. Ideally, they should also pay a regular dividend that can serve as an important source of income for retired investors or be reinvested to help grow a portfolio.\n\nPutting one\u2019s nest egg into the stock of a high-flying start-up company that is unprofitable, pays no dividend and trades at a sky-high price-earnings ratio is likely not the way to go for people looking to manage a financially comfortable retirement. Generally speaking, investors will want to seek out blue-chip stocks that pay a reliable dividend and offer decent growth prospects. Here are a few stocks that fit the bill.\n\nThese are the three most undervalued retirement stocks to buy in July 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a better stock for retirement than Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). The holding company of famed investor Warren Buffett is incredibly diversified, stable and cash-rich. Few other stocks offer as good a combination of growth and safety as Berkshire Hathaway. The company also continues to be led by Buffett, who, at age 93, remains one of the best investors, managers and ethical leaders in Corporate America.\n\nFor this year\u2019s first quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reported that its operating profits rose 39% to a record $11.2 billion. Berkshire\u2019s cash balance swelled to $188 billion, also a record. Buffett has said that the company\u2019s cash-on-hand is likely to exceed $200 billion by the end of this year\u2019s second quarter. If there\u2019s a knock on Berkshire Hathaway, it is that the company has never paid stockholders a dividend despite the massive cash hoard. But Buffett insists the money is better spent reinvesting in Berkshire\u2019s business.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s more affordable Class B stock has risen 21% over the last 12 months, including a 15% gain this year.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a classic blue-chip stock currently trading at a very cheap multiple. The Detroit automaker\u2019s share price is changing hands at only five times future earnings estimates. That\u2019s rock bottom in the current market. The low price-earnings ratio exists despite the fact that GM stock has risen 30% so far in 2024. General Motors also pays a quarterly dividend of 12 cents a share for a yield of 1.04%.\n\nGM stock has been rising on a string of positive news. The automotive giant recently reported its best quarterly sales figures in four years, lifted by a 40% increase in sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). The company\u2019s first-quarter financial results were equally impressive. In mid-June, General Motors announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. When one considers retirement stocks, GM ticks most boxes.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nShares of software and snack giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) look like a steal right now. The company behind products such as Pepsi, Gatorade and Lay\u2019s potato chips has seen its stock slide 12% lower over the past year. PEP stock is currently trading 16% below its 52-week high. The stock\u2019s price-earnings ratio is a modest 24x, and it pays a quarterly dividend of $1.35 per share for a strong yield of 3.35%.\n\nThe company\u2019s most recent Q1 financial results beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as the company\u2019s international sales strengthened. However, PEP stock has taken a hit due to concerns about the impact of weight loss drugs on sales of its products and a U.S. recall of some Quaker Foods cereal and bars that lowered its sales volumes. But despite these near-term headwinds, PepsiCo remains a great undervalued retirement stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Underappreciated Stocks Ready to Break Out: July Edition",
        "content": "When it comes to companies representing the most upside potential, indicating they are underappreciated, small-cap companies come to mind. These businesses are often valued between $250 million to $2 billion. This vast spread accounts for multiple sectors, as a list of small-cap stocks shows.\n\nWhile they generally are quite more volatile than mid or large-cap companies (where valuations range from $2 billion to $10 billion and $10 billion to $200 billion respectively), small-caps are valuable portions of an investment portfolio. That is primarily because, at their current development stage, it\u2019s likely they are still expanding. Depending on several factors, it could cause their valuation to skyrocket. In the end, this benefits the cautious investor. Here are three underappreciated companies to buy this month.\n\nTopgolf Callaway Brands (MODG) a man golfing on a golf course\n\nSource: sattahipbeach/Shutterstock.com\n\nTopgolf Callaway Brands (NYSE:MODG) is a consumer-centric, leisure-focused company that operates internationally, but is headquartered, and has a strong presence, in the U.S. It manufactures and distributes golf equipment, while also providing \u201cTopgolf\u201d branded venues for consumers to play golf in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMODG stock was recently valued at $14 a share giving it a market cap of $2.69 billion. That puts it slightly out of the small-cap limit. However, the company still has solid growth prospects. With quarterly revenue decreasing 2% year-over-year (YOY), it is clear Topgolf shanked the ball a bit. However, the golf pro beat earnings per share expectations, putting the company back on the fairway.\n\nMODG is making major moves through Topgolf. It recently partnered with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and is using the partnership to generate buzz. For example, buyers of a qualifying drink have a chance to win a Topgolf gift card. Additionally, insiders bought $2 million worth MODG shares, indicating that management agrees the stock is a buy.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurant\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDarden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) owns and operates several well-known full-service restaurant brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood and The Capital Grille. Based in Orlando, Fla., Darden Restaurants serves a wide range of cuisines across the U.S. and Canada\n\nDRI stock is currently trading around $137 a share with a market cap of $16.7 billion. The company\u2019s financials and growth are solid with profit and operating margins of 9.02% and 13.42% respectively. As we wait for Q3 earnings, the stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year and is set to do so for this quarter too. The company has seen continuous growth over the past four years with revenue increasing by 58%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother reason why investors might want to invest in this stock is its high dividend yield. It currently boasts a dividend yield of 3.74%. Additionally, as Americans gain more disposable income, the revenue stream for Darden Restaurants is likely to increase. People will always have a demand for dining out and the restaurant\u2019s diverse portfolio of chains, each offering different types of food, positions it to benefit from consumer trends. It makes Darden Restaurants one of the best-underappreciated breakout stocks to buy.\n\nTenet Healthcare (THC) two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallway\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) operates a nationwide network of hospitals, outpatient centers and Conifer Health Solutions, which offers revenue cycle management and value-based care. It focuses on integrated healthcare services and specialty care.\n\nTHC stock saw a massive increase in profits in Q1 2024, going from $244 million in Q4 2023 to a whopping $2.14 billion. The stock has also consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, with an average surprise of 56.4%. The stock has a very high beta of 2.15, indicating its shares are highly volatile. It means Tenet experiences larger price swings compared to the market.\n\nThis can be beneficial for investors looking for high returns, as price fluctuations create opportunities to buy low and sell high. The recent earnings surge, driven by strong performances in its ambulatory care segment, USPI and inpatient services demonstrates THC\u2019s growth potential despite its volatility. As healthcare demand remains consistent, this volatility can provide significant upside for investors who are willing to manage the associated risks. It makes THC an underappreciated breakout stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "June CPI release, PepsiCo earnings, UK economic growth - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the day slightly lower as investors await the release of the latest inflation data, which could guide expectations of interest rate cuts later this year. The new earnings season has nearly arrived, while the U.K. economy returned to growth in May.\n\n1. June CPI to cement September easing?\n\nThe key monthly U.S. consumer inflation report is due later in the session, and is expected to show inflation easing and pave the way for rate cuts in September.\n\nOn an annual basis U.S. June headline CPI is expected to slow to 3.1%, while core CPI is seen steady month-on-month at 0.2%.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that \"more good data\" would build the case for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates.\n\nPowell was testifying in front of the House of Representatives on the second day of his semi-annual Congressional testimony, after speaking to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.\n\nAs it stands, Fed funds futures are showing a 73% chance that the central bank eases at its September meeting, according to CME FedWatch, and inflation meeting forecasts will likely cement those expectations.\n\nBut a surprise spike could further jolt projections, rattle the equity markets and boost the U.S. dollar.\n\n2. Futures edge lower ahead of key inflation release\n\nU.S. stock futures edged lower Thursday, consolidating from record levels, ahead of the release of key inflation data, which could solidify expectations for an interest rate cut in September.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 22 points, or 0.1%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 3 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell by 15 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe broad-based S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite once more closed at fresh record highs on Wednesday, after Fed head Jerome Powell stated that the central bank did not need to see inflation falling below 2% to begin cutting interest rates.\n\nThis prompted hope that the central bank\u2019s next meeting in September will see the start of a rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThis brings the June reading of the consumer price index, due later in the session, firmly into focus, with investors looking for an easing for confirmation.\n\nIn the corporate sector, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) stock rose over 2% premarket after announcing its first membership rate increase since 2017, while WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) added 12% premarket on the back of its solid fiscal third quarter report.\n\n3. Quarterly earnings season set to start\n\nThe new U.S. quarterly earnings season starts in earnest on Friday, with results scheduled from a number of the nation\u2019s major banking institutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of that soft drinks giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and carrier Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are set to report before the market opens later Thursday.\n\nThe strong results in the previous quarter have set consensus expectations very high, with projections for the second quarter suggesting an earnings increase of 8.6% compared to the same period in the previous year, with revenues also expected to rise by 4.7%.\n\nThis anticipated growth rate is the most significant since the 9.9% uptick observed in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cWe expect S&P 500 firms will again clear the bar set by consensus estimates,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs said, in a note dated June 28. \u201cHowever, the magnitude of earnings beats is likely to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 has rallied 16% so far in 2024, driven by a handful of massive stocks poised to benefit from emerging artificial intelligence technology.\n\nOnly 24% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in the first half, the third-narrowest six-month period since 1986, according to BofA Global Research strategists.\n\nMeanwhile, the equal-weight S&P 500 -- a proxy for the average stock -- is only up around 4% this year.\n\n4. UK economy shows healthy growth\n\nThe U.K. economy returned to growth in May, with monthly gross domestic product climbing by 0.4%, a bigger increase than the 0.2% expected and an improvement from the flat growth in April when wet weather hit consumer spending.\n\nOver the three months to May, the economy expanded by 0.9%, the strongest reading since the three months to January 2022.\n\nThis news will be warmly welcomed by the new government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as the economy gradually recovers from a brief and shallow recession at the end of last year.\n\nSterling was trading around its highest levels since early March, boosted by the growth numbers but also by BoE policymakers indicating that inflation remains persistent.\n\nThe timing of a rate cut was an \"open question\", Chief Economist Huw Pill said, dealing a blow to bets of an easing cycle beginning in August.\n\n5. Crude rise after drop in US stockpiles\n\nCrude prices rose Thursday, extending recent gains as a drop in U.S. inventories boosted expectations of tighter global supplies.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) climbed 0.4% to $82.41 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.4% to $85.39 a barrel.\n\nU.S. crude inventories fell by 3.4 million barrels last week, far exceeding expectations, while gasoline stocks fell by 2 million barrels, much bigger than the 600,000-barrel draw expected during the U.S. Fourth of July holiday week.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also stuck to its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2024 and next year, in its monthly report.\n\nThe International Energy Agency releases its monthly report later in the session, and traders will be looking to see if the Paris-based organization updates its more downbeat forecasts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nJune CPI release, PepsiCo earnings, UK economic growth - what's moving markets\n\nAsian FX bears ease as U.S. rate cut bets solidify: Reuters poll\n\nHalf of German manufacturers expect revenue growth only in 2025, VDMA reports\n\nView comments",

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) Q2 Earnings: What To Expect\n\nFood and beverage company PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) will be reporting results tomorrow before market hours. Here's what investors should know.\n\nPepsiCo met analysts' revenue expectations last quarter, reporting revenues of $18.25 billion, up 2.3% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' organic revenue growth estimates but a miss of analysts' gross margin estimates.\n\nIs PepsiCo a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting PepsiCo's revenue to grow 1.3% year on year to $22.62 billion, slowing from the 10.4% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $2.16 per share. PepsiCo Total Revenue\n\nThe majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. PepsiCo has only missed Wall Street's revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 2.3% on average.\n\nLooking at PepsiCo's peers in the consumer staples segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Constellation Brands delivered year-on-year revenue growth of 5.8%, meeting analysts' expectations, and McCormick reported flat revenue, in line with consensus estimates. Constellation Brands's stock price was unchanged after the results, while McCormick was up 4.8%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Constellation Brands's results here and McCormick's results here.\n\nStocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed inflation signals have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and while some of the consumer staples stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share prices down 3.9% on average over the last month. PepsiCo is down 2% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $183.7 (compared to the current share price of $161.8).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Q2 Earnings Season Kicks Off with These 5 Key Charts",
        "content": "Second quarter earnings season is upon us. As always, it will be kicked off by the big banks, including JPMorgan Chase. But more importantly, there will also be about a dozen other companies reporting, with many in key consumer products categories.\n\nAll eyes will be on the consumer this earnings season. Are they still spending? Will the consumer keep the US economy out of a recession?\n\nThese early earnings reports are going to be important. This week we\u2019ll hear from a furniture retailer, an airline, a beverage and snack maker, several big banks and a bellwether for manufacturing and construction.\n\nWill this earnings season provide another catalyst for the bulls to push stocks even higher?\n\n5 of the Most Important Earnings Chart this Week\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bassett Furniture (BSET) is coming off a big miss last quarter but it has only missed three times in the last 5 years. Bassett Furniture is a small cap furniture retailer. But furniture has been struggling with home sales falling 30%+ off the 2021 highs. Will Bassett provide insight into the housing market this week?\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delta Airlines, Inc. (DAL) has beat four quarters in a row. The shares have rallied in 2024, gaining 15.2%. But over the last month, Delta Airlines shares have fallen 8.1%. Is Wall Street starting to get nervous about what an airline like Delta might report?\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) continues to be an earnings all-star. PepsiCo has a tremendous earnings surprise track record. It hasn\u2019t missed in 5 years, even with a pandemic raging around the world. But even though the earnings surprise chart looks great, the shares are lagging. PepsiCo is up just 21.9% over the last 5 years, which lags the S&P 500, up 86% over that same period. What will be a catalyst for PepsiCo this quarter?\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fastenal Co. (FAST) has missed just 3 times in the last 5 years. Two of those misses were before the pandemic hit in Feb 2020 but the third miss was just last quarter. Was it a one-off? Fastenal shares are down 3% year-to-date but over the last 5 years have gained 96%, which beats the S&P 500 up 86%. Will Fastenal turn it around this quarter?\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) has beat 7 quarters in a row. It has only missed 3 times in the last 5 years which is a great earnings surprise track record. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are hitting new 5-year highs in 2024. It is up 77.6% over that period, but that is under performing the S&P 500, which was up 86%. Is JPMorgan Chase still the leader of the big banks?\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): Did This Consumer Staple Stock Outperform in Q1?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Staples Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands against the other consumer staples stocks.\n\nConsumer staples stocks are for the risk averse investor and for those who like to hedge their investment portfolios. Also known as consumer defensive stocks, these are often sizeable firms that operate in industries that see stable demand during economic downturns. Some such sectors include essential retailers and pharmaceuticals, since while an economic slowdown decimates demand for pricey products such as GPUs, food and daily essentials survive simply because consumers can't live without them.\n\nAt the same time, not only do consumer staples stocks allow investors to ride out the storm in a dark economy, but they also provide them the chance to either grow their portfolio or earn a stable income in the form of dividends. Insider Monkey looked at consumer staples stocks that pay dividends as part of our coverage of 13\u00a0Best Consumer Staples Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this list, the stock with the highest dividend yield had a yield of a stunning 9.69% which came on the back of a stunning 54 years of consistent dividend growth.\n\nLike their counterparts in the consumer cyclical stock category, consumer staples stocks are also dependent for the most part on the economy. These are sizeable and stable firms that pay impressive dividends as we've highlighted above. However, like all other stocks, consumer staples are also dependent on the business cycle. The business or the economic cycle is divided into four phases. These are the early phase, the mid phase, the late phase, and the recessionary phase. For staples, the late and recessionary phases are the best when it comes to returns. Even though the market has produced 20% in average returns per year in the early phase since 1962, consumer staples have consistently produced the strongest returns in the recessionary phase and remain in the green during the late phase.\n\nAnalyzing data for business cycles since 1962 shows that the average returns of consumer staples stocks during the recessionary and late phases sit at ~14% and 5%, respectively. Since averages are influenced by outliers, we can also subtract the market's performance from staples stocks' performance and take the midpoint of the results. Doing this reveals that while during the late stage, the returns become negligible (but not negative), in a recession, they actually gain a percentage point or so to sit at 15%! Not only does this indicate that staples broadly outperform the market in a recession, but a hit rate (the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of 100% indicates that the performance is consistent across all business cycles since 1962.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince there's a stark difference in the returns offered by consumer staples stocks during different periods of a business cycle, it becomes important to try to decipher which phase we're in right now. Determining this is no easy task, and we can use two approaches. The first of these is to see what the professionals are saying. On this front, research from investment bank Morgan Stanley shares some details. It shows that the economy has been in a downturn since last year, which is synonymous with the mid of a late stage cycle or the start of a recession. We can also read economic indicators and try to match them with what is typically observed during a stage of the economic cycle. Analyzing three data points, namely the GDP growth rate, inflation, and retail inventories shows that GDP growth slowed down to 1.4% in Q1 2024 from a far more robust 3.4% in Q4 2023; inflation in April was 2.6% for the PCE in May 2024 and still higher than the Fed's preferred 2%, and retail inventories jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics indicate that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which comes before a recession.\n\nShifting gears, it's also important to see which sectors within consumer staples stock can benefit from consumer spending during an economic downturn. According to the Labor Department, the relative importance of food at home and used cars grows during a recession. These sat at 8.64 and 1.91 for data collected between 2009 and 2010, and grew from 7.66 for food and 1.77 for cars in the boom period represented by data collected between 2005 and 2006. As an exercise, you can scan our list for which stocks might benefit from an uptick in spending for these products.\n\nWhile consumer staples stocks can be worthwhile investments, their share price gains tend to be more muted compared to high-growth sectors like consumer technology or electric vehicles. This is because their underlying fundamentals and business models are not typically focused on rapid expansion. For instance, one of the most popular consumer staples stock indexes maintained by the S&P is up a respectable 8% year to date and 7.55% over the past twelve months. On the flip side, the benchmark index is up by 26% over the past twelve months, while the technology heavy stock indexes have delivered as much as 31% in appreciation.\n\nAt the same time, consumer staples stocks might also be the perfect place for investors to take refuge in the current stock market environment. The S&P benchmark index's price to earnings ratio is 21, which is near historically high levels. Data from investment bank Goldman Sachs shows that a P/E ratio of 20 places it in the 85th percentile of the index's ratios since 1990. Overvaluation concerns for the benchmark persisted in June 2024, with the latest survey from Bloomberg News showing that the majority of the 586 market participants surveyed believed that the market was more overvalued than cash and US credit.\n\nKeeping up with the cautious sentiment, roughly half of the participants polled also believe that the market can undergo a correction of as much as 10% this year, and 31% of the participants surveyed also believe that negative news on the AI front could lead to a selloff, with 27% holding the opinion that stocks could fall if unemployment continues to increase. Within this turmoil, one of the few sectors that Goldman Sachs believes might offer investors some stability is consumer staples as they have lagged the broader market in performance (a fact that we also noted above in the form of a 23 percentage point difference between the consumer staples and the benchmark stock indexes).\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top consumer staples stocks to buy. Smart money often thinks ahead, so it might be worth seeing how the hedge funds are investing as investors brace for economic impact. If you're interested in learning more about consumer staples, then you should read Top 20 Largest Consumer Staples Companies in the World.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best consumer staples stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 most valuable consumer staples stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close up of a glass of a refreshing carbonated beverage illustrating the company's different beverages.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 62\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is also a dominant force in the global carbonated beverages market. Since both PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola operate in the same industry, their performance is also dependent on similar trends. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola tend to do well during periods of moderate inflation as they can grow revenue by increasing prices and maintaining tight cost control to ensure that the percentage of price increases is higher than the internal cost increases. At the same time, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) also has to ensure that a slew of new products help it maintain market share in the developed world, and gain market share in the competitive and untapped developing world. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shares have lost roughly 3% year to date as investors believe that since inflation has started to drop, it can not aggressively grow its revenue by increasing prices.\n\nDuring its Q1 2024 earnings call, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s management commented on its hopes for the developing world and how success in the developed world might translate into success in the region:\n\nI think our team in Europe is doing a fantastic work. It started with strong productivity, simplifying the business and driving cost control, eliminating duplication and then reinvesting that money back into our brands and becoming more competitive and also driving our availability and driving our brand preference. And that is a flywheel that is working for us across both developing and developed markets in Europe. Obviously, developing markets a bit more. So if you think about Eastern Europe markets are growing a little bit faster than Western Europe markets. Western Europe markets have been impacted a little bit in this first quarter by some of the negotiations, and that\u2019s not atypical in Europe.\n\nBut I think we have a good flywheel in Europe, and Europe will be expanding its portfolio along the lines of what the US has been doing, which will give us additional consumers and additional penetration in households across developed and developing markets. So we feel good about the flywheel in Europe. But at the center of that is a very strong productivity, cost discipline and reinvestment strategy that is, in a way, what we\u2019re trying to do across the full company, elevating our productivity and driving their investments both into affordability, availability, a better brand equity and then investing back into our future, digitalization and sustainability at the center of that investment. So it\u2019s a flywheel that we\u2019re trying to do for all the world.\n\nOverall PEP ranks 6th on our list of the best consumer staples stocks to buy.

While we acknowledge the potential of PEP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "35% of the S&amp;P 500 Is Concentrated in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Here's What That Means for Your Portfolio.",
        "content": "Mega-cap growth stocks continue to dominate the broader market and contribute the bulk of gains in the major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. But the sheer value of some of the largest companies might surprise you.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven industry-leading tech-focused companies: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThese seven companies are now so valuable that they make up a combined 35.5% of the S&P 500. Here's what these changing market dynamics mean for the stock market and how to position your portfolio in a way that matches your risk tolerance and helps you achieve your investment objectives. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nA double-edged sword\n\nThe S&P 500 is up over 44% since the end of 2022. The primary reason is that the sectors containing Magnificent Seven stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 as a whole, while the other eight sectors are underperforming. ^IXT Chart\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia are in the tech sector. Alphabet and Meta Platforms lead the communications sector. And Amazon and Tesla are in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nLarge stocks can move the market when they put up monster gains, especially if you factor in sizable companies that fall outside the Magnificent Seven -- such as Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which is now valued at more than $800 billion  and is up more than threefold since the end of 2022. MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nThe Magnificent Seven are so valuable that they can single-handedly spark a so-called correction in the S&P 500. A correction is a fall of 10% to 20% in a major market index, so an average decline of 28% in the Magnificent Seven would put the S&P 500 in correction territory. That math doesn't even factor in sizable stocks like Broadcom that would likely fall in lockstep with a major sell-off in Nvidia and other tech stocks.\n\nIn this vein, the Magnificent Seven's influence extends beyond their weight in the S&P 500. The group has been driving monster gains in the index during the past 18 months or so, but the larger it becomes, the more vulnerable the market will be to a growth-driven sell-off.\n\nExpectations are high\n\nNo matter your investment time horizon or risk tolerance, it's important to be aware of the S&P 500's composition, especially when it undergoes a significant makeover. The index changes based on the economy's evolution and investor sentiment. In other words, it's a moving target, or benchmark, driven by different themes at different times.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome investors might be nervous about the market's relatively expensive price tag, with the S&P 500's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sitting at almost 29. Even if the market rally is overextended, putting new capital to work -- even at record highs -- has historically been a winning strategy for investors.\n\nThere's also a case to be made that the market deserves to be more expensive. If the S&P 500 grows earnings faster because the weighting of growth stocks increases, then it would stand to reason the P/E ratio should be higher as well.\n\nInvesting is more about where a company is headed than where it is today. And so far, mega-cap growth stocks have mostly delivered on earnings growth. For example, Amazon is still not terribly overvalued despite seeing its stock price more than double during the past 18 months.\n\nA high P/E basically means that investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company relative to its earnings today because they expect earnings to be higher in the future. However, if growth slows and expectations come down, it can lead to a sizable sell-off.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the S&P 500's valuation has become based increasingly on future potential earnings, whereas a few decades ago, the most valuable companies -- consumer staples giants, banks, and oil and gas businesses -- were valued more on their past earnings. Outsize gains could continue if companies deliver the growth that investors expect, but there could also be higher volatility in the market.\n\nBuild a portfolio that's right for you\n\nGiven the expensive valuation of the S&P 500 and its puny 1.3% dividend yield, value- and income-focused investors could consider integrating quality dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a diversified portfolio.\n\nAs a starting point, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) trade at discounts to the S&P 500, are both Dividend Kings (with over 50 consecutive years of dividend increases), and both have dividend yields of more than 3%.\n\nThe SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF(NYSEMKT: DIA) mirrors the performance of that index and has a 1.8% yield and a 23.3 P/E -- making it a good option for folks looking to stick with blue chip stocks but through a value lens.\n\nThere are plenty of low-cost Vanguard ETFs that can provide a lifetime of passive income, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF(NYSEMKT: VYM), Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF(NYSEMKT: VDC), and the Vanguard Utilities ETF(NYSEMKT: VPU). Targeting lower-growth, higher-yield sectors can be an effective way to balance a portfolio that is heavily allocated in growth stocks.\n\nAdjusting with the times\n\nAt first glance, the market might look overvalued because the S&P 500 has an inflated P/E ratio. But that's mostly because it is now heavily weighted in surging mega-cap growth stocks.\n\nPlenty of pockets of the market are teeming with quality value and income stocks. Now is the perfect time for investors to conduct a portfolio review and update their watch lists to ensure they hit their passive-income goals while aligning their investments with their risk tolerance.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stocks mostly edged higher Tuesday as increased expectations for a September rate cut kept the tech sector buoyant before testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nAt 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 rose 10 points, or 0.2%, and NASDAQ Composite rose 75 points, or 0.4%.\n\nPowell testimony in focus\n\nPowell is set to begin his two-day testimony before Congress, starting later Tuesday with the Senate before the House on Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed Chair is expected to offer more cues on monetary policy, with markets watching for any dovish signals, especially in the wake of softer inflation and labor data in recent weeks.\n\nBeyond Powell\u2019s testimony, several other Fed officials are also set to speak this week, including open markets committee members Michelle Bowman and Raphael Bostic.\n\nInvestors will also be looking to key consumer price index inflation data for June, which is due on Thursday, for more cues on the path of inflation. The Fed has repeatedly signaled that it needs more confidence that inflation is easing, before it can begin cutting interest rates.\n\nThe CME Fedwatch tool showed traders pricing in an over 70% chance for a 25 basis point cut in September, up from last week\u2019s 59%.\n\nConfidence that rate cuts are coming shortly resulted in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite eking out record highs on Monday.\n\nEarnings season to begin with banks\n\nFocus this week will also be on the second quarter earnings season, which is set to begin with results from several major banks at the end of the week.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) are set to report quarterly earnings on Friday.\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also on tap this week.\n\nAnalysts, on average, see S&P 500 companies increasing their aggregate earnings per share by 10.1% in the second quarter, up from an 8.2% increase in the first quarter, according to LSEG I/B/E/S data.\n\nAdditionally, the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continued to post gains, both rising over 2%, amid growing confidence in all things linked with artificial intelligence.\n\nCrude slips after Beryl passes\n\nCrude prices edged lower Tuesday, after Hurricane Beryl caused less damage to a key U.S. oil-producing region than expected, easing concerns over supply disruption.\n\nBy 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) fell 0.2% to $82.14 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $85.56 a barrel.\n\nMarket participants are also keeping an eye on the situation in the Middle East, as hopes of a possible ceasefire deal in Gaza, potentially reducing worries about global crude supply disruption, hit crude prices on Monday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute releases its estimates of weekly crude inventories later in the session, with a draw expected given the summer driving season.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stocks mostly higher; tech sector gains ahead of Powell's testimony\n\nWall Street analysts bullish on genetic testing firm Tempus AI\n\nFrance's election outcome 'negative' for credit rating, Moody's warns\n\nView comments",

        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2024 numbers on Jul 11, before the opening bell.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $22.6 billion, implying 1.2% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. For quarterly earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.16, suggesting 3.4% growth from the $2.09 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings beat of 5.9%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 5.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Whispers\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nTrends Leading Up to PEP\u2019s Q2 Results\n\nPepsiCo benefits from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. The company is anticipated to have reaped gains from the resilience and strength of the global beverage business.\r\n\r\nMarket share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. PEP\u2019s food business is expected to have benefited from gains across core brands like Doritos, Lay\u2019s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos, offset by softness in the Quaker Foods North America (\u201cQFNA\u201d) segment due to recent product recalls.\r\n\r\nThe December 2023 and January 2024 product recalls at the QFNA segment have eaten into PEP\u2019s first-quarter revenues and profits, mainly denting its sales in the United States. The company has been on track to resume more production of certain products affected by the recalls through other facilities.\r\n\r\nAlthough PepsiCo expects the recall-related financial impacts to moderate as the year progresses, we expect the product recall-related implications to affect second-quarter results, to some extent. Our model numbers indicate a 22% decline in organic revenues for the QFNA segment.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, PEP\u2019s top line is expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. Additionally, strength in the international business, capitalizing on strong category growth in the developing and emerging markets, is expected to have boosted the top line in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nOur model predicts consolidated year-over-year organic revenue growth of 2.8% for the second quarter, driven by a 4.5% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 1.7% decline in volume.\r\n\r\nOn an organic basis, we expect the company to deliver notable revenue growth across its international units in the second quarter. However, the North America business is expected to reflect softness due to the continued impacts of the product recalls in QFNA, and moderated revenue growth in the Frito-Lay North America and PepsiCo Beverages North America segments.\r\n\r\nOur model estimates organic revenue growth of 6% each in Latin America and AMESA, 10% in Europe, and 8% in the APAC, reflecting continued momentum in the international units. Then again, we expect organic revenues to decline 22% at QFNA and increase 1% in PBNA, while the FLNA is expected to report flat organic revenues in the second quarter.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s bottom line and margin performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to reflect the continued benefits of its ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives that have been driving superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies, offset by ongoing inflationary pressures and planned business investments.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the adjusted gross margin to increase 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 54.9% in the second quarter. Gross margin growth is expected to result from eased supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s shares have exhibited a downward trend, shedding a notable percentage over the year-to-date period. Specifically, the stock has declined 3.2% against the broader industry and the Consumer Staples sector\u2019s growth of 1.7% and 0.6%, respectively. Additionally, PepsiCo's stock has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, which rallied 17.5% during the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPepsiCo's stock performance shows a stark contrast to its arch-rival Coca-Cola KO, which saw its shares rise 8.2% year to date. This disparity highlights a significant dip in PepsiCo's stock price relative to its key rival. Meanwhile, shares of competitors, including Monster Bevearge MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP, recorded declines of 13.6% and 2%, respectively, in the same period.\r\n\r\nCurrently trading at $164.39, PepsiCo\u2019s stock is closer to its 52-week low of $155.83 and reflects a 14.5% discount from its 52-week high of $192.38. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDespite this recent downturn, PEP\u2019s valuation on a forward 12-month P/E basis suggests that it may be an attractive pick for investors. The stock is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 19.33X, below the industry average of 20.29X and the S&P 500\u2019s average of 21.91X.\r\n\r\nWhile PepsiCo faces challenges, including underperformance compared with industry peers and broader market indices, its current valuation discount and strong brand portfolio could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nPepsiCo has demonstrated consistent revenue growth and solid profitability, supported by its diverse product range and global reach. The company is focused on continually driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by reducing costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. In 2024, the company anticipates elevating its focus on holistic cost-management initiatives to boost productivity and using these savings to mitigate cost inflation and prioritize investments in its brands, innovation and channel expansion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PepsiCo has been investing heavily in its digital transformation and e-commerce capabilities. Its efforts to enhance its direct-to-consumer platforms and digital marketing initiatives have been paying off, as evident from its contribution to revenue growth. The company has a strong balance sheet, with healthy cash flows that enable it to invest in growth opportunities, pay dividends and conduct share buybacks.\r\n\r\nWhile PepsiCo\u2019s strong financial performance and strategic initiatives provide a solid foundation for growth, the evolving industry dynamics and external risks justify a neutral stance on its investment potential. Inflationary pressures, product recalls at QFNA and changing consumer behavior are some factors affecting its financial performance in recent quarters.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs PepsiCo prepares to announce its second-quarter 2024 earnings, trends such as strengths in the beverage segment, robust trends in international business, digital growth, sustainability efforts, inflationary challenges, innovative product launches and geopolitical factors all play a crucial role in shaping PepsiCo's performance. Investors and analysts will be keen to see how these trends translate into financial results and what guidance the company provides for the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile PEP\u2019s strong financial performance and strategic initiatives provide a solid foundation for growth, the evolving industry dynamics and external risks justify a neutral stance on its investment potential. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to navigate these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities to assess its long-term viability. As the company continues to navigate market dynamics and implement strategic initiatives, its ability to regain momentum and deliver value to shareholders will be crucial.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "I Have High Hopes for These 3 Dirt Cheap Dividend Stocks in the Second Half of 2024 (and Beyond)",
        "content": "This year has been a great one for the broader indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, which have been driven higher by outsize gains in megacap growth stocks. But other pockets of the market have done fairly poorly, like industry-leading dividend payers whose consistency and stability shine in a downturn but are getting overlooked in today's market.\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP), Deere(NYSE: DE), and Chevron(NYSE: CVX) stand out as three dividend stocks that have been underperforming the S&P 500 but look like excellent buys now. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPut some pep in the step of your passive-income stream\n\nIn her 12-year stint as PepsiCo CEO, Indra Nooyi helped improve its brand and grow profits. Since taking over as CEO in October 2018, Ramon Laguarta has done a good job navigating many unexpected challenges, including the U.S.-China trade war, the worst of the pandemic, inflation, and supply chain bottlenecks. Effective management is extremely important, since every percentage point in margin can mean hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFor Pepsi, growth usually comes from new product developments, strategic acquisitions, or efficiency improvements. Nooyi was instrumental in helping Pepsi acquire Quaker Oats and Gatorade. But arguably the biggest deal under Laguarta's tenure has been with the energy drink company Celsius (NASDAQ: CELH).\n\nThe company entered a partnership with the upstart beverage company in August 2022. It included a $550 million cash investment in exchange for convertible stock, an estimated 8.5% ownership in Celsius on a converted basis, and a 5% annual dividend. As with other consumer goods companies, Celsius shares have pulled back recently, but there's plenty of reason to think the deal will pay off over the long term.\n\nCelsius also benefits from using PepsiCo's strategic distribution network. It is a complicated business -- arguably far more complicated than its peer, Coca-Cola -- because PepsiCo operates its own production facilities compared to Coke's royalty/franchise model. PepsiCo is also involved in far more product categories besides beverages, like snacks and breakfast items, whereas Coke focuses on what it does best: beverages.\n\nPepsi has a lower market capitalization than Coke but generates roughly double the revenue and half the operating margin. Due to its size and business model, it is a bit more vulnerable than Coke. However, the company's past management and current leadership have a track record of effective capital allocation.\n\nHovering around a 52-week low with a 3.3% yield, over 50 years of consecutive dividend raises, and a 24.5 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, PepsiCo stands out as an excellent stock to buy and hold for years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nDeere may be cyclical, but the stock is a bargain\n\nAfter an initial surge in early 2021, Deere stock has gone practically nowhere despite achieving record profits last year. Unfortunately, there have been glaring signs that Deere could enter a downturn.\n\nIt is a highly cyclical stock. When the company's customers are in expansion mode (and financing is inexpensive), they might be inclined to make a big purchase of its industrial machinery like farming and forestry equipment.\n\nBut when the cycle turns, Deere's sales can fall in a flash. The trick is to pay a reasonable multiple based on a company's mid-cycle earnings. Its P/E will look low when it is coming off a strong year and will be high coming off a bad year. Understandably, its P/E looks dirt cheap at just 10.9 -- but earnings are expected to decline over the medium term.\n\nConsensus analyst estimates have Deere earning $22.79 per share in fiscal 2024 and $22 in fiscal 2025,\u00a0compared to $33.17 in fiscal 2023.\n\nIt would be one thing if Deere's stock surged in lockstep with its earnings growth, but it didn't. In fact, earnings have nearly doubled over the last three years while the stock is up just 3%. Deere's earnings could be cut in half, and it would still have a P/E of about 22. It is simply too good a company to be this cheap. DE Chart\n\nAnother reason to get excited about Deere is its earnings trajectory and automation and artificial intelligence advancements. The company has been ramping up research and development spending, investing in autonomous tractors, and automating farm tasks, such as crop spacing and recommended fertilizer use that can save operators money. It is making sizable product improvements that might not impact its bottom line until the next uptick in the cycle.\n\nThe stock only yields 1.6%,\u00a0but that's mainly because it uses both dividends and buybacks to reward shareholders. Over the last five years, the dividend is up over 93% while its outstanding share count is down 12.5%. That's roughly the same pace of buybacks that Apple has done in the last five years, which is impressive considering Apple is famous for buying back a boatload of its stock.\n\nAdd it all up, and Deere looks like an excellent value stock to buy now.\n\nA relatively safe way to invest in the energy sector\n\nChevron is another stock that has gone practically nowhere over the last year or so. There are a few factors at play. The first is uncertainty regarding Chevron's acquisition of Hess, whose crown jewel is its stake in the Stabroek drilling block off the shores of Guyana. The other partners in the Guyana joint venture -- ExxonMobil and CNOOC, a Chinese national oil company -- are looking to stymie the deal and keep Chevron out of Guyana.\n\nThe good news is that Chevron doesn't need the deal to go through to be a great investment. It can continue ramping up spending in its existing plays, namely the Permian Basin. It can also continue buying back its stock, which remains a good value with a 14.4 P/E ratio.\n\nIt's also important to know how the market can reward or overlook certain qualities at different times. Right now, sentiment is optimistic, and peers like ExxonMobil are rewarded for higher spending and bold acquisitions.\n\nMany other companies have followed suit. Even ConocoPhillips, which is known for being a conservative capital allocator, announced it is acquiring Marathon Oil in a blockbuster $22.5 billion deal. With Chevron's major deal in limbo, there's just one more box left unchecked.\n\nChevron's financial health and prudence could also be getting overlooked right now. When oil prices are falling, investors often gravitate toward safe, stodgy, dividend-paying names like Chevron. And for good reason. Its financial health helped it acquire multiple companies at compelling valuations during the COVID-induced downturn when other producers were struggling to stay afloat.\n\nFor the last three years or so, oil prices have been remarkably stable and strong, which might convince some investors to gravitate toward riskier, more-leveraged plays. It could work out, but long-term investors know the best way to compound gains is to buy quality companies and hold them as long as the investment thesis remains intact.\n\nIn sum, Chevron has the qualities of an excellent long-term holding. Its greatest strength is its financial health, which is particularly important given the volatile nature of commodities like oil and gas. With its 4.2% dividend yield, the company stands out as a compelling choice for generating passive income regardless of oil prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Danish brewer Carlsberg is pouring $4.2 billion into a deal with Pepsi and Lipton distributor Britvic as Gen Z shies away from alcohol",
        "content": "The trend of people rejecting alcoholic drinks in favor of their non-alcoholic counterparts has been afoot for a while.\n\nWhile the burgeoning \u201cmoderative movement\u201d among the next generation could threaten alcohol companies' bread-and-butter, it has also opened up new avenues to cater to people\u2019s changing lifestyles and preferences.\n\nIt could even boost companies' growth after a long-drawn slump in beer sales\u2014that\u2019s what Danish brewer Carlsberg hopes with its acquisition of soft drink company Britvic announced on Monday.\n\nThe deal with Britvic, the bottler and distributor of Pepsi and Lipton drinks in the U.K., France, and elsewhere, is worth \u00a33.3 billion ($4.2 billion), a 36% premium above its share price, and will give Carlsberg a foothold in the British soft drink market.\n\nIt will also make the Danish company a major supplier of PepsiCo\u2019s operations in the U.K., helping it look beyond beer. Carlsberg already makes well-known drinks other than its lagers and pilsners, such as Somersby cider and Garage seltzers\u2014but they only make up a fraction of its sales volumes.\n\n\u201cWith this transaction, we are combining Britvic\u2019s high-quality soft drinks portfolio with Carlsberg's strong beer portfolio and route-to-market capabilities, creating an enhanced proposition across the UK and other markets in Western Europe,\u201d Carlsberg CEO Jacob Aarup-Andersen said in a statement.\n\nCracking the path ahead\n\nThe acquisition is significant for Carlsberg, which plans to turbocharge growth by 4-6% annually through 2027, according to a new strategy laid out in February. To achieve that, Carlsberg said it wants to double down on premium beers while also growing its non-alcoholic beverage offerings.\n\n\u201cThey [Carlsberg] do already have soft drinks, a combined portfolio of beer and soft drinks in a number of markets, and in those markets, the margin is higher than the average,\u201d a Carlsberg spokesperson told Fortune, attributing the efficiency to \u201cgood synergies\u201d from streamlining operations. The group also estimates an annual cost savings of \u00a3100 million ($128 million) following the acquisition.\n\n\u201cIt's very much a kind of growth-oriented acquisition, wanting to expand and invest.\u201d\n\nCarlsberg\u2019s soft drinks portfolio is small\u201416% of its group\u2019s volumes\u2014pointing to the prominence of its beer business. Despite beefing up its non-alcoholic beverage portfolio, the company still remains a brewer first, Carlsberg\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nBritvic is home to over 35 brands, including Fruit Shoot and J2O, that sell predominantly in Britain and other parts of Europe. It\u2019s been around since 1938 and is the official PepsiCo bottler and distributor in the U.K. for soft drinks like Mountain Dew and 7UP.\n\nStory continues\n\nCarlsberg\u2019s deal followed PepsiCo's agreement to waive the change-of-control clause over Britvic\u2019s bottling operations, which helped smoothen the deal after its earlier rejection.\n\n\u201cCarlsberg has been a bottler for decades, and there would be synergies in the \u201cbeyond beer\u201d business,\u201d Bernstein analysts said in a note following news about a possible deal late last month.\n\nCarlsberg\u2019s U.K. arm will take over U.K.-listed Britvic\u2019s operations and be called \u201cCarlsberg Britvic.\u201d The company will continue to look for similar opportunities in other parts of Europe to bolster its business. On Monday, it also announced that it\u2019ll buy out the joint venture it has with U.K. pub chain Marston\u2019s, further strengthening its stride towards Western European markets.\n\nMany of the world\u2019s biggest brewers, including AB InBev, Heineken, and Carlsberg, have sought to expand their non-alcoholic beverage offerings. They\u2019ve tried to increase the number of options in that segment along with launching \u201c0.0\u201d or alcohol-free alternatives to their flagship beers. Brewers are also trying to spruce up their new \u201cbeers\u201d by selling them to consumers with familiar packaging and at high-profile events like the Olympics.\n\n\u201cFor brand owners, moderation is an established trend and no-alcohol products which keep customers within a category (eg: switching beer for no-alcohol beer) or brand portfolio (eg: Switching a Heineken for Heineken 0.0) offer an option to hold on to revenue and continue to build brand equity,\u201d Susie Goldspink, head of no- and low-alcohol insights at data firm IWSR, told Fortune in an email.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

The company raised its full-year organic revenue outlook to a range of 8% to 9%, up from the previous range of 6% to 7%. Coca-Cola\u2019s global unit case volume grew by 1% in the quarter.\n\nWith a market capitalization of $272.8 billion and a consistent track record of dividend growth spanning 62 years, Coca-Cola remains an attractive option for income-focused investors. The stock\u2019s current dividend yield of 3% and a five-year beta of 0.59, indicating lower price volatility compared to the market average, further strengthen the bull case.\n\nAdditionally, analysts maintain a strong buy consensus rating for the stock, with an average price target of $68.58, suggesting an upside potential of 8% from the current price.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, known for its monthly dividend payments.

        "title": "3 Triple Threat Stocks to Buy: High Yields, Big Gains and Rock-Solid Safety",
        "content": "Life and the market are about compromise. Generally speaking, if you\u2019re looking for high growth, you typically aren\u2019t getting much in the way of dividends, if anything. On the other hand, established enterprises usually offer robust passive income at the expense of growth potential. Still, on rare occasions, it\u2019s possible to have high-yield safe stocks that can also expand the top line.\n\nFundamentally, the math helps the underlying narrative. Presently, we have thousands upon thousands of publicly traded opportunities available. It\u2019s simply not possible for analysts to provide equal coverage to every enterprise. So, it\u2019s inevitable that some companies \u2013 even big ones \u2013 fall through the cracks. Intrepid investors can exploit this \u201ccoverage gap\u201d so to speak and potentially profit handsomely.\n\nFurther, in shaky circumstances \u2013 such as a recovery from a pandemic \u2013 the established players can deliver some surprises. Basically, their massive footprint enables surprisingly stout performances. With that in mind, below are enticing high-yield safe stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest beverage (and snack) manufacturers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is no stranger to the business community. Thanks to its massive footprint, it easily commands stability. Further, amid a tough economic environment, PepsiCo offers a cheap source of caffeine. Given this and many other advantages, it\u2019s no surprise that analysts rate PEP stock a consensus moderate buy.\n\nAnother factor to consider regarding Pepsi is its financial consistency. During the past four quarters, its average earnings per share landed at $1.90. However, covering experts anticipated EPS of almost $1.81. Therefore, the earnings surprise came out to nearly 5.1%. That\u2019s not bad for an established stalwart.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Pepsi posted net income of $9.18 billion or earnings of $6.63 per share. Revenue during the cycle came out to $91.88 billion. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate 11.2% growth in the top line to $94.44 billion.\n\nLastly, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 3.33%. It makes a solid case for high-yield safe stocks to buy.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface, integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) might not seem the most relevant idea for high-yield safe stocks. With the ideological winds pushing for green and sustainable solutions, Exxon seems anachronistic. Still, the world runs on oil. And one geopolitical flashpoint could change the narrative cynically in favor of XOM stock. Thus, it carries a moderate buy view among experts with a $135.53 average price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdmittedly, Exxon has encountered a rough patch in terms of meeting expectations. In the past four quarters, its average EPS reached just under $2.19. However, analysts were looking on average for around $2.20. Therefore, the earnings surprise landed at about half a percent below parity. That\u2019s not ideal.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Exxon posted net income of $32.8 billion or $8.16 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $335.35 billion, which is rather disappointing. For fiscal 2024, analysts only see a modest lift in the top line to $353.7 billion. However, it\u2019s also possible that sales could soar to $470.13 billion based on geopolitical rumblings.\n\nOh yeah, the oil giant offers a big yield of 3.31%.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. Basically, the Golden Arches is both a business icon and a symbol of American capitalism. So, when it comes to attributes like brand power and awareness, MCD hits the safe component of high-yield safe stocks. However, does it provide much growth and is it a dividend monster?\n\nTo be sure, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to expect a blue-chip icon to have the growth potential of a promising tech startup. However, McDonald\u2019s is a respectable growth machine given how long it\u2019s been in business. During the TTM period, it posted net income of $8.6 billion on sales of $25.76 billion. In the most recent quarter, its sales growth rate (year-over-year) came in at 4.6%.\n\nSure, that\u2019s not the most impressive stat you\u2019ve seen. However, keep in mind that for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate revenue of $26.6 billion. That\u2019s up 11.7% from the prior year. As for the bottom line, McDonald\u2019s has seen average EPS of $2.96 in the past four quarters. That helps to support the underlying dividend yield of 2.67%. Overall, it\u2019s one of the balanced high-yield safe stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "A reading on inflation and the start of second quarter earnings reports will greet investors after a holiday-shortened week that saw stocks close near record highs.\n\nWith job growth slowing, investors will be closely watching the release of June's Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Thursday as the case builds that the Federal Reserve could be set to cut interest rates in September. Semiannual testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will also be a key focus for investors.\n\nOn the corporate side, Friday morning will see some of America's largest financial institutions, including JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citi (C), kick off second quarter earnings season. Results from PepsiCo (PEP) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) will also be in focus earlier in the week.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose nearly 2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied over 3%. Both finished the week at record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which has been a notable laggard all year, gained a more modest 0.5%.\n\nCase for a September rate cut builds\n\nOn Friday, the June jobs report showed the US economy added more jobs than expected last month. But economists found several signs of a slowing labor market in the details of the report.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose to 4.1%, its highest level since November 2021. Meanwhile, job gains for April and May were revised lower by 111,000, showing the labor market's robust gains over the past several months weren't as solid as initially thought.\n\nSeveral economists believe this print will lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September.\n\n\"The June jobs report showed more signs of cooling in the labor market, with job growth including revisions weaker than expected, the unemployment rate rising and earnings growth slowing,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients.\n\n\"Federal Reserve officials have become increasingly focused on the downside risks to the labor market and the June data bolster our forecast for the Fed to cut rates in September and at every other meeting thereafter.\"\n\nRenaissance Macro's head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the report should \"firm up expectations of a September rate cut.\"\n\n\"Economic conditions are cooling and that makes the trade-offs different for the Fed,\" Dutta added, \"Powell should use July to set up a September cut.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of Friday, investors were pricing in a roughly 75% the Fed cuts rates by its September meeting, up from a 64% chance seen the week prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.\n\nWith Powell set to give his semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill this week, investors will be closely listening for any hints at policy moves ahead of its July 30-31 meeting.\n\nRead more: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\nPrice check\n\nWhile the labor market's slowing has added to the case for Fed rate cuts, inflation remains a key factor.\n\nIn May, inflation readings showed prices increased at their slowest pace of 2024. Powell remarked last week that those readings \"suggest that we are getting back on a disinflationary path.\"\n\nThe first test for whether that path will continue is set for release on Thursday morning with the June CPI report.\n\nWall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 3.1% annually in June, a slowdown from the 3.3% rise seen in May. May's data was the slowest year-over-year inflation reading since July 2022. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, a slight increase from the flat reading seen in May.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to rise 3.4% over last year in June, unchanged from May. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.2%.\n\n\"We expect the June CPI report to be another confidence builder following the undeniably good May report,\" Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a research note previewing the release.\n\nRead more: Inflation fever breaking? Price hikes on everyday expenses finally ease up.\n\nBig banks set the stage\n\nEarnings season is upon us again, and Financials (XLF) will be in particular focus over the next few weeks; 40% of the S&P 500 companies set to report over that period will be from the sector, according FactSet.\n\nThe sector isn't expected to be a leader in earnings growth this quarter, with analysts forecasting 4.3% year-over-year earnings growth in Q2. This places Financials seventh among the eleven sectors in the S&P 500 for earnings growth.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith recently reported, regional banks remain a key concern for the industry. Regional banks are expected to report a 26% year-over-year decline in earnings growth. The JPMorgan Chase logo is seen at their headquarters building on May 26, 2023, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nA 'high bar' for Q2 earnings\n\nAfter climbing out of an earnings recession in 2023, corporates are finally facing a new challenge this reporting season: a high bar to beat.\n\nConsensus forecasts are for the S&P 500's earnings to grow 8.8% against the year prior in the second quarter, according to FactSet. This would mark the highest year-over-year earnings growth for the index since the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\"We expect the magnitude of EPS beats to diminish as consensus forecasts set a higher bar than in previous quarters,\" Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a client note previewing earnings season.\n\nWith the market trading near record levels ahead of this reporting period, Kostin and other strategists are cautious about how much upside investors can expect if results top Wall Street expectations.\n\nKostin noted that last quarter, companies that beat expectations saw their shares outperform the S&P 500 by 3 basis points in the following day of trading, well below the historical average of 100 basis points.\n\nGiven that investor sentiment is still elevated entering this round of earnings, Kostin reasoned, \"the reward for beats should be smaller than average this quarter, although not as extreme as during the 1Q season.\"\n\nCiti US equity strategist Scott Chronert struck a similar tone, warning that given \"lofty implied growth expectations,\" the prospect of large stock pops this quarter is limited.\n\n\"Markets likely need to see raises coupled with solid execution driven beats to sustain recent gains or push higher from here,\" Chronert wrote in a weekly research note on Friday. \"The concern is while fundamental trends are positive and consensus estimates are attainable, valuations suggest the buy-side will demand more.\"\n\nBroadly, this has Wall Street tampering expectations about how much higher second quarter earnings reports could send a stock market.\n\nResearch from Deutsche Bank chief equity strategist Binky Chadha showed that the S&P 500 rises 80% of the time during earnings season, with an average return of 2%.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Chadha noted, \"the market run up into earnings season and overweight equity positioning argue for a muted rally.\"\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed 1-year inflation expectations, June (3.17% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings releases.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, June (89.9 expected, 90.5 prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nEarnings: Helen of Troy (HELE)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA mortgage applications, July 5, (-2.6% prior), Wholesale inventories month-over-month, May final (0.6% prior); Fed Chair Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee\n\nEarnings: Manchester United (MANU), WD-40 (WDFC), PriceSmart (PSMT)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, +0% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, June (+0.2% expected, +0.2% previously); Consumer Price Index, year-over-year, June (+3.1% expected, +3.3% previously); CPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, June (+3.4% expected, +3.4% previously); Real Average Hourly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.7% previously); Real Average Weekly Earnings, year-over-year, June (+0.5% previously);Initial jobless claims, week ended July 6 (238,000 previously);\n\nEarnings: Conagra Brands (CAG), Delta Air Lines (DAL), PepsiCo (PEP), Progressive (PGR)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: Producer Price Index, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, -0.2% previously); PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.2% previously); Core PPI, month-over-month, June (+0.1% expected, 0% previously); Core PPI, year-over-year, June (+2.3% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, July preliminary (67 expected, 68.2 previously)\n\nEarnings: BNY Mellon (BK), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy PepsiCo Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Few companies are as proven and durable as food and beverage giant PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). The company has performed for decades, showering investors with dividends and building wealth over generations. The stock has steadily faded in recent weeks and is approaching 52-week lows.\n\nYears of inflation have consumers grappling with higher grocery prices, and sentiment is dropping. Investors have already seen companies like McDonald's cite weaker consumer spending as a headwind to their business.\n\nSo, should investors stay away, or is now the time to buy the stock?\n\nHere are four reasons long-term investors should buy the stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Best-in-class brands\n\nPepsiCo's world-class food and beverage brands have been its pillar of strength, creating decades of growth and wealth for its shareholders. The stock price has appreciated more than 10,000% over its lifetime, and the dividend has grown over 5,300%. PepsiCo's brands include beverage headliners like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and Lipton, while its food products include names like Doritos, Cheetos, Lay's, Quaker, and many more. PEP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nDominating the grocery aisle means that PepsiCo products get top-tier shelf space in supermarkets and pricing power because consumers generally will buy what they know and love. Additionally, food and beverage products are small ticket items; PepsiCo can get away with bumping the price a few cents because it doesn't dramatically impact consumers' budgets. Decades of population growth and price increases have steadily driven revenue to over $91 billion annually.\n\n2. Still an excellent dividend grower\n\nPepsiCo is a dividend dynamo because it offers yield and growth. Investors buying today get a solid starting yield of 3.3%. On top of that, PepsiCo has raised its dividend by an average of 6.6% for the past five years. Its most recent 7.1% increase shows that management is confident in the company's outlook. Remember, PepsiCo has raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years (a Dividend King), so to maintain inflation-beating dividend growth after all this time is impressive.\n\nNotably, the dividend is well secured by a payout ratio that's 66% of PepsiCo's estimated 2024 earnings. Profits are high enough that PepsiCo can comfortably afford the dividend and still invest in the business or repurchase shares. This consistent growth outpacing inflation is how the stock has performed so well for so long.\n\n3. Solid growth outlook\n\nWhat is most important for investors is whether PepsiCo can continue to grow at this pace. After all, this company, which sells snacks and bottled beverages, is now a $225 billion behemoth. Fortunately, PepsiCo's growth formula still seemingly has mojo left.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe beauty of PepsiCo is its many growth levers. It chugs along as it raises prices, sells more products to a growing global population, and acquires and launches new product brands. Some of PepsiCo's recent hits include newer beverage brands such as Bubly and Starry. It has also invested in the energy drink industry by acquiring Rockstar in 2020 and entering into a major collaboration with Celsius in 2022.\n\nManagement is currently guiding for 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth in 2024 and a 7% increase in earnings per share over 2023. Analysts looking further out expect more of the same. Consensus estimates call for earnings growth averaging over 7% annually for three to five years.\n\n4. Stellar business at a fair price\n\nThe market does silly things sometimes. Weaker consumer spending could put some pricing pressure on PepsiCo, and the stock market is seemingly pricing that into the stock. Shares have now fallen over 17% from their high. PepsiCo has averaged a P/E ratio of almost 26 over the past decade, and shares have now fallen below 20 times this year's estimated earnings: PEP PE Ratio Chart\n\nDoes the stock deserve to be traded at a discount? While PepsiCo might feel some pressure while consumers are struggling, it's hard to argue that the business is fundamentally worse, especially when the outlook remains consistent with the company's past performance. Do you want to discount the stock? That's already happened. Barring an unexpectedly bad collapse in the business, PepsiCo stock seems like a fantastic business trading at a fair price today.\n\nTo apply Buffett's advice, investors shouldn't hesitate to buy a wonderful business like PepsiCo at a fair price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "When you\u2019re still years away from retirement, you want to ramp up your portfolio to target growth-oriented enterprises. At the same time, there\u2019s a lot of comfort and confidence in so-called cash cows. These enterprises enjoy a range of attributes, from low volatility, high consistency and dominance in their chosen markets. As a result, blue-chip income stocks help complement your overall holdings.\n\nTo be clear, you don\u2019t want to abandon ship with your growth strategies. However, some allocation to blue-chip income stocks may help investors weather market storms. Because cash cows often generate high profit margins and robust cash flow, they can drive over obstacles that to them are the equivalent of annoying speed bumps (rather than wheel-busting potholes).\n\nOf course, every asset class has its set of pros and cons. With cash cows, you\u2019re dealing with established entities. Therefore, outright growth is eschewed in favor of consistent shareholder rewards. Still, that can be appropriate during times of uncertainty. With that, below are blue-chip income stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nA membership-only big-box retailer, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) easily ranks among the blue-chip income stocks to add to your portfolio. Fundamentally, the company benefits from a higher-income consumer base. I don\u2019t mean to be crude but the membership fee helps weed out lower-income shoppers. Plus, because Costco favors bulk purchases, it can be an effective mitigation tool against inflation.\r\n\r\nOf course, what makes COST stock a cash cow is its robust financials. In each of the past four quarters, Costo beat its bottom-line target. On average, the company\u2019s earnings per share landed at roughly $4.04. This performance translated to an average earnings surprise of 4.18%.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Costco posted net income of $7.17 billion or earnings of $16.15 per share. Revenue during the cycle hit $253.7 billion. Also, data from Yahoo Finance reveals that Costco\u2019s operating cash flow reached $12.11 billion, while its levered free cash flow (FCF) hit $5.25 billion.\n\nAs for the dividend yield, it\u2019s not much at 0.55%. Still, it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nColgate-Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nA consumer goods giant, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is best known for its personal care products. In particular, its oral health unit keeps the lights on. Moreover, CL stock benefits from consistent and predictable demand. No, it\u2019s not the most exciting idea ever. Still, the point remains that irrespective of economic cycles, people still brush their teeth every day.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith such predictability comes consistently solid financials. In the past four quarters, Colgate managed to beat bottom-line targets in all of them. The average EPS came out to 84 cents. Further, the average earnings surprise landed at 4.7%. During the TTM period, Colgate posted net income of $2.61 billion or $3.15 per share.\n\nIn the same cycle, revenue reached $19.75 billion. Further, the most recent quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) hit 6.2%. The retailer generated operating cash flow of $3.69 billion while levered FCF landed at $2.8 billion.\n\nNotably, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.09%. For a combo of consistency and yield, CL makes for one of the top blue-chip income stocks.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nAnother powerhouse in the consumer goods segment, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) offers a range of products that people use daily. While it\u2019s a boring entity, PG stock on those rare moments can be rather exciting. For example, during the Covid-19 onslaught, toilet paper became a hot commodity. Cynically, this dynamic suited P&G just fine.\n\nNowadays, people look to the company to provide consistent financial performances, irrespective of outside conditions. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, P&G posted an average EPS of $1.64. This print yielded an earnings surprise of 6.55%. In the TTM period, the consumer goods giant posted net income of $14.84 billion or $6.12 per share.\n\nIn the same cycle, revenue hit $84.06 billion. The most recent quarterly sales growth rate pinged at 10.5%. Operating cash flow reached $19.43 billion while levered FCF hit $12.29 billion. Thus, it\u2019s easily one of the blue-chip income stocks.\n\nFor the yield, shareholders enjoy a solid one at 2.47%. Further, the payout ratio \u2013 while modestly elevated at 61.48% \u2013 is reasonable given what you\u2019re getting.\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA home-improvement store, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) technically calls under the consumer cyclical space. However, one could make the argument that HD represents an indelible business. That\u2019s especially true when the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan. Often, when natural disasters strike, Home Depot stores will remain open (so long as it\u2019s feasible). It can be a literal lifesaver.\n\nOf course, with this framework, it\u2019s no shocker that HD ranks among the best blue-chip income stocks to buy. Granted, the company doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of excitement financially. However, it did beat all of its past four bottom-line quarterly targets. Further, the average earnings surprise came out to 2.15%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Home Depot posted net income of $14.87 billion or $14.93 per share. Revenue in the cycle clocked in at $151.83 billion. Further, operating cash flow landed at $21.06 billion, while levered FCF reached $14.72 billion.\n\nFor passive income, Home Depot offers a forward dividend yield of 2.68%. Further, the payout ratio isn\u2019t bad at 57.1%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nA powerhouse brand in the snack food and beverage industry, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) isn\u2019t exactly having the greatest year so far. However, patient investors may be able to see significant gains over the long run. That\u2019s because Pepsi is one of the world\u2019s top providers of caffeinated beverages. Increasingly, young people are turning to non-coffee energy drinks, which may bode well for PEP stock.\n\nFinancially, what makes Pepsi a top-tier enterprise among blue-chip income stocks is consistency. As with the other companies, the beverage maker beat all of its past four bottom-line quarterly targets. The average EPS came out to $1.90 while the average earnings beat landed at 5.08%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Pepsi posted net income of $9.18 billion or $6.65 per share. Revenue hit $91.88 billion, with the most recent quarterly sales growth rate landing at 2.3%. Operating cash flow pinged at $12.79 billion while levered FCF was $6.42 billion.\n\nNotably, Pepsi offers a forward dividend yield of 3.33%. However, the payout ratio is elevated at 76.2% so it\u2019s something to watch.\n\nCisco (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in San Jose, California, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) falls under the communication equipment industry. Per its public profile, Cisco designs, manufactures and sells Internet (IP)-based networking products to the communications and information technology (IT) industry. It also offers critical services, such as data center switching and enterprise routing. CSCO stock hasn\u2019t enjoyed the best start to the year but circumstances could be improving.\n\nAs one of the blue-chip income stocks, Cisco\u2019s main selling point right now is consistency. Along with the other companies, the telecom equipment giant beat its past four bottom-line targets. The average EPS came out to 97 cents while the average earnings surprise hit 6.45%. That\u2019s impressive considering the circumstances.\n\nIn the TTM period, Cisco posted net income of $12.12 billion or $2.96 per share. Revenue in the cycle hit $55.36 billion. Also, operating cash flow landed at $13.12 billion while levered FCF came out to $14.41 billion.\n\nTo be upfront, investors shouldn\u2019t expect much growth this year in either earnings or sales. However, to make up for it, Cisco offers a forward yield of 3.37%.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the world\u2019s biggest healthcare juggernauts, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) easily ranks among the top cash cows. Following the spin off of its consumer health products division, J&J focuses now on pharmaceuticals and medical tech. The move may add efficiency to the overall framework. In fairness, JNJ stock has gotten off to a slow start. Still, over the long run, it should do fine.\n\nFinancially, J&J represents one of the few companies that you can consistently depend on. That said, I need to be upfront: the company missed its Q2 2023 estimate by 6 cents, with a negative earnings surprise of 2.3%. Still, the average EPS in the past four quarters came out to roughly $2.56. And the earnings surprise poked its head at 1.6%.\n\nIn the TTM period, J&J posted net income of $17.07 billion or $6.74 per share. Revenue hit $85.65 billion. Also, operating cash flow clocked in at $23.19 billion while levered FCF was $24.3 billion.\n\nFinally, J&J offers a forward dividend yield of 3.39%. It\u2019s one of the blue-chip income stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "content": "Long History Of Dividend Growth: Recent Hikes By Home Depot, PepsiCo, And Genpact\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFor investors seeking steady income, stocks with a solid track record of consistent dividend growth are particularly appealing. In this article, we spotlight three companies \u2014 Home Depot, PepsiCo, and Genpact \u2014 that have recently announced dividend hikes and offer attractive yields.\n\nHome Depot\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) is the world\u2019s largest home improvement specialty retailer, operating more than 2,300 warehouse-format stores offering more than 30,000 products in-store and one million products online in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Its stores offer numerous building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and d\u00e9cor products and provide various services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rentals.\n\nThe company has paid consistent dividends for 38 years and raised them for 14 consecutive years. Most recently, in February, it announced a 7.7% quarterly dividend hike to $2.25 per share, or $9 annualized. The annual yield on the dividend is 2.68%.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the company earned $151.83 billion in revenues and $14.87 billion in net income.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a global leader in snacks and beverages, owning well-known household brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay\u2019s, Cheetos, and Doritos, among others. The company dominates the global savory snacks market and also ranks as the second-largest beverage provider in the world (behind Coca-Cola). It has diversified exposure to carbonated soft drinks and water, sports, and energy drink offerings.\n\nThe company raised its dividends for 52 consecutive years. Its previously announced 7% dividend increase to $1.355 per share, or $5.42 annualized, is expected to begin with its June 2024 payment. The annual yield on the dividend is 3.33%.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the company earned $91.87 billion in revenues and $9.18 billion in net income.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nGenpact\n\nGenpact (NYSE:G) provides business process management services. Clients are industry verticals operating in banking and financial services, insurance, capital markets, consumer goods, life sciences, infrastructure, manufacturing and services, health care, and high-tech. Genpact\u2019s services include aftermarket, direct procurement, risk and compliance, human resources, IT, industrial solutions, collections, finance and accounting, and media services.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company raised dividends for seven consecutive years. Most recently, in February, the company announced a nearly 11% quarterly dividend hike to $0.1525 per share, or $0.6100 annualized. The dividend yield is 1.90%.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the company earned $4.50 billion in revenues and $642.1 million in net income.\n\nThere Are Better High-Yield Opportunities\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "Pepsi Is a Rock-Solid Dividend King, but So Is This Blue Chip Stock That's Down 12% in the Past 3 Months",
        "content": "Dividend stocks can be excellent investments to generate passive income. The best dividend-paying companies have steady earnings growth, and in turn, they increase their payouts to shareholders. The elite among them eventually may earn entry into the category of Dividend Kings -- companies that have raised their payouts annually for at least 50 consecutive years.\n\nIn addition to being a Dividend King, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) has a yield of 3.3% at its current share price -- high relative to the average yield of 1.3% for the S&P 500. It also has a fairly recession-resistant business, which makes it exactly the kind of consistent company that many risk-averse income investors look for.\n\nPepsi is a top-tier dividend stock and a familiar name to most consumers, but the less widely known Illinois Tool Works(NYSE: ITW) may be an even better Dividend King to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nGetting to know ITW\n\nIllinois Tool Works, which also goes by ITW, is a global industrial conglomerate with a diversified product portfolio spanning several industries. The company mainly sells products to businesses, so it would be understandable if you were unfamiliar with many of its brands.\n\nIt doesn't make massive earth-moving equipment or highly complex machinery. Rather, many of its products act as role players in larger systems. Here's a breakdown of its segments and some product examples.\n\nSegment Product Examples 2023 Revenue 2023 Operating Margin Automotive Fasteners, interior and exterior components, powertrain components $3.2 billion 17% Test & Measurement and Electronics Laboratory testing and assembly equipment, accessories, consumables, aftermarket parts and services $2.8 billion 24% Food Equipment Advanced warewash, services, equipment for cooking, refrigeration, and food processing $2.6 billion 27% Construction Products Fasting solutions, complementary fasteners and accessories, construction design and engineering software $2 billion 28% Welding Welding equipment, specialty consumables, safety solutions $1.9 billion 32% Polymers & Fluids Engineered adhesives, sealants, coatings, lubricants, additives, automotive wiper blades, cleaners $1.8 billion 27% Specialty Products Zippers and six-pack rings for packaged goods, medical device products, aircraft ground support equipment, coating and metalizing businesses for product branding and national security markets $1.7 billion 27%\n\nData source: Illinois Tool Works.\n\nOne thing that separates ITW from other industrial conglomerates is that none of its seven segments dominate its revenue mix. And aside from automotive -- which has been struggling in North America but growing rapidly in China -- all of its segments have excellent operating margins. The overall business notched an operating margin of more than 25% in 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nManagement is projectng for an even better 26% to 27% operating margin in 2024 and a 30% operating margin by 2030.\n\nGrowth concerns\n\nITW's main challenge has been sluggish organic growth. Its organic revenue actually declined 0.6% last quarter. ITW is forecasting for just 1% to 3% organic growth for the year and 2% to 4% revenue growth. Earnings per share (EPS) growth is expected to be a little better at 6% to 10% for a total of $10.30 to $10.70 in full-year EPS -- partially thanks to a one-off accounting change.\n\nZoom out a bit further, and you'll see that ITW's EPS only increased by 20.6% during the past three years. That's not a terrible growth rate for a stodgy dividend payer, but it's not exactly great, either. Revenue has grown even slower, at 14.7%. However, take a look at an even longer time frame, and you'll notice that its earnings have grown much faster than revenue -- which is a testament to ITW becoming a more efficient, higher-margin business. ITW EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nA leaner business with widening margins is better than an overextended model that leans heavily on sales growth at the expense of margins. But eventually, ITW will need to chart a path toward both wider margins and higher revenue, especially because there's a limit to how many efficiency improvements a business can make.\n\nIf you tune in to a typical ITW earnings call, you'll find that most of the conversation centers around margins. It might seem trivial to go back and forth about a single percentage point in margins. But ITW generated $16.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and $4.2 billion in operating income -- so each percentage point change in margin equates to a $160 million difference in operating income.\n\nSince ITW is involved in so many different industries (and generates a significant amount of sales from outside North America), no company is an exact competitor. However, some companies compete with it in one or more segments. And ITW has significantly higher margins than many of these peers. ITW Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nDespite having lower revenue than Genuine Parts, Parker Hannifin, W.W. Grainger, and Emerson Electric, ITW has the highest operating income of any company on this list. What makes it such a special company is that it combines size with wide margins across many different product categories. Conglomerates can often be bulky and inefficient, but ITW is a good example of an effective conglomerate that is benefiting from diversification.\n\nExpect a dividend raise soon\n\nLast August, ITW announced a 7% dividend hike to $1.40 per share per quarter. ITW typically announces its annual payout raises in the summer, with the first affected payout coming in October. Given the consistency of its dividend program, investors should expect an announcement sometime in the next couple of months.\n\nNot all Dividend Kings use stock buybacks as a primary way to return capital to shareholders, but ITW plans to repurchase $1.5 billion of its shares this year. By comparison, it distributed $418 million in dividends last quarter -- or roughly $1.7 billion during the past year. So on the surface, ITW's 2.4% yield may not look super attractive, but its capital return program is much stronger when one factors in the buyback program.\n\nHigh margins help ITW squeeze more profit from every dollar in revenue. But buying back stock reduces its share count, leading to higher earnings per share. During the past five years, it has reduced its shares outstanding by 7.8%, which has boosted EPS by 36.1% even as net income rose by 24.2%.\n\nBuybacks have also helped keep a lid on ITW's valuation. The recent sell-off in the stock paired with steady earnings growth has dropped its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio down to just 23.4 -- which is below its three-, five- and seven-year median P/E ratios. And ITW was trading above these key levels just a few months ago. ITW PE Ratio Chart\n\nITW is a well-rounded buy\n\nITW is a phenomenal business, but its valuation was pricey, and its revenue growth is weak. Now that the stock has sold off, the conglomerate's only bad quality is its low sales growth.\n\nThere are nearly perfect businesses, but there's no such thing as a perfect stock. The best companies are usually expensive relative to their trailing or projected earnings, while bad companies trade at cheap levels for good reasons.\n\nHowever, ITW is close to a perfect blue chip dividend stock. It is an extremely efficient business with high margins, an over 50-year track record of raising dividends, a sizable buyback program, and a reasonable valuation. The conglomerate model works well for ITW and helps the company offset much of the cyclicality of its various end markets.\n\nAdd it all up, and there's a lot to like about ITW as a top-tier Dividend King to buy and hold for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Illinois Tool Works right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Illinois Tool Works, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Illinois Tool Works wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Coca-Cola: This Stock Has Made Far More Millionaires",
        "content": "It's not just one of the world's best-known brand names. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) has also been -- and continues to be -- one of the world's more rewarding investments. Plenty of buy-and-hold investors have become millionaires while sitting on a long-term stake in Coca-Cola stock, well-rewarded for their patience.\n\nThe biggest name in the beverage business, however, isn't the company behind the industry's most rewarding stock. That honor actually belongs to shares of rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP).\n\nAnd the underpinnings of its superior performance aren't apt to change in the foreseeable future either.\n\nNumbers (and pictures) don't lie\n\nSurprised? It would be a little surprising if you weren't. Coca-Cola is viewed by most as the premier name in the drinks business, after all. But, it's true. Over the past 50 years, PepsiCo's share price has outgained Coke's nearly threefold. KO Chart\n\nVeteran investors will point out that Coke is dividend royalty -- literally. It hasn't just paid a quarterly dividend for decades now. It's also raised its full-year payout every year for the past 62 years, qualifying it as a Dividend King. As it stands right now only 53 stocks are eligible for the title.\n\nCare to guess one of the market's other Dividend Kings? If you said PepsiCo, you're right! It's raised its total yearly dividends for 52 consecutive years now. While its dividend-growth track record isn't quite as lengthy, the company's been upping its payouts at a measurably faster clip. KO Chart\n\nThe big question here, of course, is how? How is PepsiCo able to do what its bigger rival couldn't for its respective shareholders?\n\nThe answer is multifaceted, but it isn't complicated.\n\nPepsiCo is different than Coca-Cola in all the ways that matter\n\nTo fully understand how PepsiCo has achieved the unthinkable, take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\nPepsiCo isn't just a beverage company. Roughly half of its top line is actually driven by its snack foods segment made up of several familiar brand names including Doritos, Rold Gold pretzels, Fritos, Cheetos, and of course, Lay's potato chips. The North America snack foods division alone accounts for roughly half of the entire company's operating profits thanks to its far greater profit margins than the highly competitive beverage business could ever support. All told, Frito-Lay's operating profit margin is consistently in the ballpark of 25% of sales.\n\nCoca-Cola's operating margin is similar at around 20% of revenue, for the record. But, Coke's business is distinctly different than PepsiCo's drinks and snacks operation. Whereas PepsiCo does most of its own bottling and handles the bulk of its own food production, Coca-Cola's business model is largely royalty-focused -- the company punts the bulk of its production work to third-party bottlers that simply purchase Coke's concentrated syrups and pay franchise fees for the right to distribute its brand-name products.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's a high-margin business model to be sure. But its revenue potential is also modest. Although Coca-Cola's brands of beverages easily outsell PepsiCo's in terms of the total amount of revenue produced, the company itself only collected $45.8 billion worth of sales last year, turning $11.3 billion of that into operating income. PepsiCo banked greater operating profits of just under $12 billion in 2023, reporting cash flow of $13.4 billion versus Coca-Cola's $11.6 billion.\n\nNo, PepsiCo isn't producing leaps and bounds more earnings and higher profit margins than its top beverage rival is. The nickels and dimes add up over time, however.\n\nIt's worth adding that while Coke's royalty/franchise model punts much of the risk of being a bottler to its partner bottlers, it also means Coca-Cola loses a bit of control of the production process. PepsiCo may not like operating its own production facilities, but having complete oversight of them still offers a strategic advantage. One of these advantages is being able to serve as a bottler for other brands including competing soft drink brands like Dr. Pepper, energy drink upstarts like Celsius, as well as juice brand Ocean Spray.\n\nPepsiCo's stock-buyback and stock-retirement programs are also consistently more shareholder-friendly than Coca-Cola's. Since mid-2004, PepsiCo has reduced its share count by more than 20%, versus Coke's reduction of just a little more than 11%. KO Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) Chart\n\nJust buy PepsiCo stock and forget about it already\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results, of course, meaning there's no assurance PepsiCo shares will continue minting more millionaires than more popular Coca-Cola stock does. Besides, there's more to stock-picking than mere numbers.\n\nThe underpinnings of these two stocks' different performances are largely rooted in each companies' products, operations, and corporate ethos though. Those are things that are unlikely to change anytime soon. And PepsiCo's management certainly doesn't want them to.\n\nBottom line? If you're considering a new position in either of these companies to round out the consumer goods portion of your portfolio, PepsiCo is (surprisingly enough) the better option at this time. That's particularly true in light of the fact that you'd be plugging in while its shares' forward-looking dividend yield stands at 3.24% versus Coke's lesser yield of just over 3%.\n\nDon't overthink this. More than that though, don't let your investing judgment be clouded by your personal preference or nostalgia for a particular brand of beverages.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investing in Dividend Kings through a Roth IRA presents a special opportunity. Not only do you benefit from the tax-free growth and withdrawals that a Roth IRA offers, but you also harness the power of compounding dividends from some of the most dependable companies in the market. This strategy can significantly compound your retirement savings over time.\n\nHowever, not all Dividend Kings are great buys for your Roth IRA. Some companies hike up their dividends to keep up the record while their businesses underperform. It is best to avoid such companies and put your money into the stickiest names out there while also allocating some money to solid dividend stocks with upside potential. Here are seven to look into.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) needs no introduction. I believe PepsiCo is one of the most compelling Dividend King stocks you can buy right now for your Roth IRA, if not the most compelling one.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn Q1 2024, PepsiCo repeated the consistency and stability that I love about this company. Net revenue grew a solid 2.26% year-over-year to $18.25 billion, beating estimates by nearly $146 million. Earnings per share also impressed at $1.61, exceeding expectations by 9 cents.\n\nWhat really caught my attention was the stellar performance of PepsiCo\u2019s international businesses. International sales have reached a staggering $36 billion and are growing at an impressive high single-digit rate with robust profitability.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s omnipresent snack and beverage portfolio gives it one of the stickiest, most resilient sales profiles around. Dividend kings for ROTH IRA: PEP dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith a 3.25% forward dividend yield and 53 consecutive years of dividend increases, PepsiCo is a cornerstone holding for steady long-term returns. I view any pullback as an attractive buying opportunity for this Dividend King.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a biopharmaceutical company. I must say, the latest earnings report from AbbVie is very encouraging. And if I were to recommend one big biopharma stock right now, it would have to be ABBV. The biopharmaceutical industry may not be the most stable, and a lot of the growth relies on new drug discoveries and hinges on approval from the FDA. However, I think big biopharma companies are still pretty safe. The medical industry is growing very fast and will likely keep growing even faster as the population ages and, unfortunately, becomes more unhealthy.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company reported Q1 adjusted EPS of $2.31, beating expectations by 8 cents, on revenue of $12.31 billion that grew 0.7% YOY and also surpassed estimates by an impressive $374 million. This solid performance shows that the company is successfully navigating the U.S. loss of exclusivity for Humira.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019m increasingly confident that AbbVie\u2019s pipeline positions it strongly for sustained long-term growth. ABBV dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith the stock offering an attractive 3.62% forward dividend yield and an unmatched track record of 52 consecutive years of dividend increases, income investors should find a lot to like here.\n\nAll things considered, AbbVie looks like a high-quality biopharma giant that dividend growth investors can count on to deliver reliable income and capital appreciation for years to come.\n\nConsolidated Edison (ED) Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.\n\nSource: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is a regulated utility that provides electric, gas, and steam service in New York City and Westchester County, New York. I believe this Dividend King is a very attractive long-term buy for your Roth IRA, especially if you\u2019re looking for a steady compounder with 51 straight years of dividend increases.\n\nIn Q1 2024, ED reported solid adjusted EPS of $2.15, up 17.5% YOY, driven by strong rate base growth. Management is investing heavily to protect their equipment from climate change and build a grid capable of delivering 100% clean energy. They also gained approval for a $1.2 billion project to meet growing electricity demand. This bodes well for future earnings growth.\n\nWhile utilities may not be the most exciting sector, their stability is unmatched. Volatile commodity prices, like natural gas, have little impact on their bottom line since fuel costs are largely passed through to customers. This makes ED\u2019s 3.7% dividend yield extremely reliable. ED dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWith management reaffirming their full-year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance of $5.20 to $5.40, I\u2019m confident ED will continue its impressive dividend growth streak for many years to come. It\u2019s a true sleep-well-at-night stock for your Roth.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola Consolidated sign outside of their building. COKE Stock.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a global beverage company renowned for its iconic soft drinks. In my view, this dividend king deserves a prime spot in your Roth IRA thanks to its unbeatable brand and impressive growth potential. While Q1 2024 saw some mixed results across regions, Coca-Cola\u2019s overall performance remained solid with 7% comparable EPS growth despite significant currency headwinds.\n\nIts execution of an all-weather strategy is paying off, as evidenced by volume growth, margin expansion, and continued investments. It has been gaining momentum in key markets like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. And although China\u2019s recovery remains gradual, I believe Coca-Cola\u2019s long-term prospects there are bright.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts expect Coca-Cola to deliver around 5% annual sales growth and 6% annual EPS growth over the next decade. That\u2019s impressive for a company of this size and maturity. Plus, there\u2019s significant upside potential from a weakening U.S. dollar as interest rates eventually decline. Since 2018, dollar strength has reduced Coca-Cola\u2019s earnings by a staggering 31%. But I anticipate this headwind turning into a tailwind in the coming years.

While many assume a mature company like Target would have a stable stock, it has experienced significant volatility in recent years due to the 2021 boom and 2022 bust. However, I believe Target presents a compelling investment opportunity right now, especially for dividend-focused Roth IRA portfolios.\n\nThe company is now focusing on AI, e-commerce and loyalty programs to drive future growth. They\u2019re also investing in new stores and recent partnerships like the one with Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).\n\nOnce interest rate cuts kick in, I expect consumer discretionary businesses like Target to benefit. The recent dividend hikes have been very generous recently. TGT dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe 3% dividend yield and 54 consecutive years of dividend increases add to its solidity.\n\nQ1 sales missed slightly. Nevertheless, EPS came in near the high end of guidance. Target affirmed its full-year outlook, and I\u2019m confident they\u2019re on track to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead.\n\nBlack Hills (BKH) Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.\n\nSource: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlack Hills (NYSE:BKH) is a diversified energy company that provides electric and natural gas services in eight states. While the stock has been battered in the post-pandemic era, being down 35.5% from its pre-COVID peak, I believe this presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, especially those looking for reliable income in their Roth IRA. BKH dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company has 54 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt. Plus, the current yield of 4.86% is quite juicy and well above the broader market average. I think patient investors can park some cash here, collect that rock-solid payout, and wait for the eventual recovery.\n\nOn that front, they are seeing strong customer growth. Migration trends are to thank for that. Moreover, the ongoing data center boom is driving increased demand for electricity in their service territories. In fact, management is planning an additional 400 megawatts of renewable energy projects to meet this rising demand.\n\nRLI Corp (RLI) Man in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home.

Insurance companies like RLI tend to be some of the most stable and consistent dividend payers, and I believe RLI is the cream of the crop among insurance Dividend Kings. In Q1, RLI delivered stellar results with hefty beats on both revenue and earnings. Revenue surged nearly 22% to $445 million, blowing past estimates by $50 million. Meanwhile, EPS of $1.89 topped expectations by an impressive 28 cents.\n\nManagement emphasized that they\u2019re leaning into opportunities where RLI has the expertise to shine while remaining disciplined in riskier areas. This balanced approach is paying off, with all segments posting double-digit growth and underwriting profits. RLI\u2019s investment income is also on a tear, jumping 21% as its book yield and asset base expand.

But don\u2019t be fooled, this company\u2019s impressive compounding power more than makes up for it. RLI shares have soared 62% in the last five years alone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "FDVV: A Dividend ETF Where Nvidia Is the Top Holding?",
        "content": "You might be surprised to hear that a surging but low-yielding growth stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top holding for a dividend-focused ETF, but that\u2019s exactly the position it occupies in the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Just because Nvidia and other stocks like it feature a low yield doesn\u2019t mean that dividend funds should automatically count it out, and FDVV is a good example of why, as we\u2019ll discuss in this article.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on this $2.9 billion ETF from Fidelity based on its portfolio, which consists of an attractive combination of \u201cnew-school\u201d dividend stocks like Nvidia with \u201cold-school\u201d dividend stalwarts like Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). The ETF also boasts a strong performance track record in recent years, a 3.0% dividend yield, and reasonable fees.\n\nWhat Is the FDVV ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to Fidelity, FDVV invests in an index \u201cdesigned to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.\u201d\n\nNice Mix of Dividend Stocks\n\nFDVV offers decent diversification with 105 holdings, and its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 31.2% of assets.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of FDVV\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you\u2019ve surmised from the article\u2019s title, Nvidia is the ETF\u2019s top holding, with a weighting of 6.5%.\n\nAnd Nvidia isn\u2019t the only high-growth, lower-yielding dividend stock from the tech sector that is prominent in FDVV\u2019s top holdings. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are the fund\u2019s next three largest holdings.\n\nNvidia yields less than 0.1%, Microsoft and Apple feature yields below 1.0%, and Broadcom is only slightly higher, with a yield of 1.2%.\n\nYou might wonder what these low-yielding tech stocks are doing in a \u201chigh dividend\u201d ETF.\n\nFDVV\u2019s strategy is to invest in companies expected to continue paying and growing their dividends, not simply the dividend stocks with the highest yields. Growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom are expected to grow their earnings over time and thus have the capacity to increase their dividend payouts in the future, making them a good fit for dividend funds like FDVV.\n\nThis expected earnings growth also makes them more attractive investments than many dividend stocks that feature high yields but feature low or no growth and are essentially businesses in decline.\n\nFDVV is prudent to include these stocks as, despite their lower yields, they have generated exceptional total returns over time through a combination of price appreciation and dividends. For example, Broadcom has generated an exceptional total return of 2,907% over the past decade, while Nvidia has returned a stunning 26,839% over the same time frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be clear, past performance is no guarantee of future results. It\u2019s unlikely that these stocks will continue to rise at this pace in the years to come, but this illustrates why it\u2019s worth it for dividend investors (and funds) to include lower-yielding dividend-paying growth stocks within their strategies.\n\nFDVV does a good job of mixing lower-yielding, strong performers with higher-yielding, more traditional dividend stocks investors are accustomed to seeing in dividend ETFs. These include energy giants like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and consumer staples blue chips like Pepsi, Philip Morris, and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).\n\nFDVV\u2019s holdings collectively receive favorable ratings from TipRanks\u2019 proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Seven of FDVV\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and Broadcom, ExxonMobil, and Chevron feature \u201cPerfect 10\u201d ratings.\n\nFDVV itself features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nFDVV\u2019s Performance Has Been Solid\n\nThis combination of new-school growth stocks that pay dividends and old-school dividend stocks has generated solid returns over time.\u00a0As of May 31, FDVV has generated a strong 11.1% annualized return over the past three years and a solid 14.6% annualized return over the past five years.\n\nThis means that the dividend-focused FDVV has actually outperformed the broader market over the past three years, as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) has generated an annualized return of 9.6% over this time frame (as of May 31).\n\nHowever, FDVV has slightly lagged VOO over the past five years, as VOO has returned 15.8% annually over a five-year period.\n\nThat said, this is still an admirable five-year return, and FDVV investors can feel good about the total returns the fund has generated for them. An investor who put $100,000 into the fund five years ago would have $186,240 today.\n\nAbove-Average and Growing Dividend\n\nFDVV yields 3.0%, so its dividend yield is double that of the S&P 500. FDVV has been paying a dividend for seven years and has grown its dividend payout for the last three years in a row.\n\nModerate Fees\n\nFDVV charges a very reasonable expense ratio of just 0.15%. This means that the fund charges just $15 annually for every $10,000 invested. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this expense ratio, an investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $85 in fees over a five-year period.\n\nIs FDVV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FDVV earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 83 Buys, 22 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average FDVV stock price target of $52.32 implies 11.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nI\u2019m bullish on FDVV because I like the way the fund invests in both lower-yielding but high-performing dividend-paying growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom and more traditional, higher-yielding but lower-growth dividend stocks like ExxonMobil and Chevron. This sound strategy has led to attractive double-digit annualized returns over time.\n\nFurthermore, FDVV sports an above-average dividend yield of 3.0% and charges an expense ratio of 0.15%.\u00a0Adding it all up, FDVV looks like a sound choice for investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In the latest market close, PepsiCo (PEP) reached $166.74, with a -0.36% movement compared to the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.16% gain on the day.

        "content": "This year is shaping up to be quite interesting, with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mixed signals on interest rates. Savvy investors look towards high-quality dividend kings to buy for additional income and stability.\n\nWhile growth stocks have taken off in 2024, there exist both well-known and under-the-radar dividend growth stocks worth investors\u2019 attention. These companies\u2019 impressive track records in increasing their dividend payouts for 50 consecutive years or more demonstrate financial stability, resilience, and a commitment to rewarding their shareholders.\n\nMany of them have continued to increase their dividend and grow revenue and earnings per share amid market uncertainties. By identifying and investing in these dividend kings early, investors can benefit from both capital appreciation and dividend income. Now, let\u2019s discover the top three dividend kings to buy in 2024 before Wall Street catches on.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), a household name with a history spanning more than 180 years, is synonymous with trust and quality. The company\u2019s extensive portfolio of consumer brands remains in high demand, even during economic downturns. This has allowed it to continuously return value to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.\n\nProcter and Gamble\u2019s impressive track record of 68 consecutive years of dividend increases is a testament to its financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns. PG\u2019s focus on innovation and brand building, coupled with its vast distribution network, has allowed it to maintain a strong competitive position. In recent years, the company has streamlined its operations, divesting from non-core brands and focusing on its most profitable segments. This disciplined approach has led to increased revenue growth and margin expansion over the last decade.\n\nMoreover, the company\u2019s healthy balance sheet and strong cash flows provide ample room for dividend growth and potential share buybacks. With a current dividend yield of 2.40%, PG stock remains one of the most compelling dividend kings to buy in 2024.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is another consumer staples giant with a diversified portfolio of food and beverage products. With a remarkable 52-year track record of dividend increases, PepsiCo has consistently delivered value to shareholders.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s strength lies in its diversified portfolio, which spans beverages, snacks, and nutrition products. This diversification is its core strategy, which has allowed the company to maintain a steady revenue stream over the last several decades. Moreover, the company\u2019s global presence makes it well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities in emerging markets. The Latin American market provides ample opportunity to drive long-term cash flow generation and earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite headwinds in 2023, PepsiCo delivered solid revenue growth, including a record free cash flow of $9.07 billion. In June 2024, it also raised its quarterly dividend by 7% to a record $1.355 per share. Management remains extremely confident in its ability to deliver 4% revenue growth and 8% earnings per share growth in FY24. As business conditions continue to improve in 2024, PEP stock is undoubtedly one of the top dividend kings to buy before Wall Street takes notice.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) Coca-Cola ko stock\n\nSource: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO), one of the most recognizable brands in the world, has a history of more than 130 years. The company\u2019s extensive distribution network, marketing prowess, and brand loyalty have allowed it to maintain its dominant position in the beverage industry.\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s long streak of dividend increases spans an astonishing 62 years. This means that during the boom and bust cycles of the market, it still managed to increase its dividend and return capital to shareholders. It speaks volumes to the company\u2019s robust business model, stable cash flows, and strong brand loyalty. Coca-Cola\u2019s strategy is similar to PepsiCo\u2019s, where diversification in its portfolio remains a key pillar to its stability. It stays ahead of industry trends, and happily embraces healthier food and beverage options that are in demand from consumers. More specifically, beverages that have a low profile of sugar or zero sugar content.\n\nFurthermore, its growing revenue and strong margin expansion capabilities are also another positive sign for the future. If you\u2019re looking for dividend kings to buy in June, KO stock is a noteworthy candidate worth considering.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Danish beer group Carlsberg confirmed it has struck a deal with Pepsi which removes a potential block to its takeover swoop for Robinsons maker Britvic.\n\nCarlsberg said US drinks firm PepsiCo has agreed to waive a so-called change-of-control clause as part of its long-term bottling agreement with British soft drinks group Britvic.\n\nThe clause was effectively a poison-pill arrangement that could have prevented an acquisition of Britvic by allowing Pepsi to end its bottling deal, making the UK company a less attractive takeover target.\n\nIt was first reported at the weekend that Pepsi had told Carlsberg it would not look to exercise the clause in the case of an agreed takeover of Britvic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarlsberg said: \u201cCarlsberg confirms that it has reached agreement with PepsiCo whereby PepsiCo has agreed to waive the change-of-control clause in the bottling arrangements it has with Britvic.\n\n\u201cThis waiver will come into effect should an acquisition of Britvic by Carlsberg, which has the recommendation of Britvic\u2019s board, proceed to completion.\u201d\n\nShares in FTSE 250-listed Britvic rose as much as 11% in Monday morning trading, having surged on Friday after it said it had rejected a \u00a33.1 billion takeover move by Carlsberg.\n\nBritvic said the approach \u201csignificantly undervalues Britvic, and its current and future prospects\u201d, but added it would \u201cconsider any further proposal on its merits\u201d.\n\nCarlsberg said on Monday that it is \u201cconsidering its position\u201d amid reports it could be preparing to put forward a proposal of up to \u00a314 a share.\n\nA takeover of Britvic would mark yet another sale of a UK-listed company as low valuations have seen foreign buyers strike deals for British counterparts, including the \u00a35.8 billion acquisition of FTSE 100 packaging firm DS Smith.\n\nBritvic, which has its headquarters in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said last week that it had rebuffed a proposal from Carlsberg for the whole business on June 11.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt said the potential bid valued the company at 1,250p per share.\n\nBritvic revealed the approach came a week after it had rejected a 1,200p per share approach from Carlsberg.\n\nCarlsberg issued a separate statement on Friday confirming the move to its investors, saying it believes there could be long-term growth opportunities from a deal.\n\nThe Danish company said: \u201cCarlsberg believes that the proposal represents a compelling opportunity for Britvic shareholders to realise their investment in full in cash at an attractive valuation.\n\n\u201cCarlsberg believes that the potential transaction would enable it to capture appealing long-term growth opportunities from Britvic\u2019s comprehensive portfolio of leading brands in an attractive segment of the beverage market where Carlsberg already has a strong track record.\u201d\n\nIt comes four years after Carlsberg significantly expanded in the UK through its \u00a3780 million joint venture deal with Marston\u2019s, creating the Carlsberg Marston\u2019s Brewing Company, which makes brands including Hobgoblin and Pedigree.",

        "content": "Coca-Cola And Pepsi Have More Than Tripled Their Dividends Over The Last 20 Years, Can Keurig Dr Pepper Do The Same?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nOver the past two decades, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have proven themselves to be dividend growth powerhouses in the beverage industry. Both companies have not only maintained but significantly increased their dividend payouts, demonstrating their commitment to shareholder returns. As a relative newcomer to the scene, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) has shown promising signs of following in their footsteps. Let\u2019s examine the dividend growth trajectories of these beverage giants and assess whether Keurig Dr Pepper has the potential to match their impressive performance.\n\nCoca-Cola and PepsiCo\u2019s Dividend Growth\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s dividend growth has been remarkable over the past 20 years. In 2004, the company\u2019s quarterly dividend was $0.125 per share (adjusted for splits). Today, it stands at $0.485 per share, representing a 288% increase. This translates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.01% over two decades. An investment in Coca-Cola 20 years ago would now earn a 7.63% yield on cost.\n\nCoca-Cola now offers a forward dividend yield of 3.1%, showcasing its ability to provide both growth and income to its shareholders.\n\nPepsiCo has managed to outpace even Coca-Cola\u2019s impressive dividend growth. In 2004, PepsiCo\u2019s quarterly dividend was $0.23 per share. It has since grown to $1.355 per share, an astounding 489% increase. This represents a CAGR of 9.27% over the 20-year period. An investment in PepsiCo 20 years ago would now be earning a nearly 9.9% yield on cost.\n\nPepsiCo currently offers a forward dividend yield of 3.26%, slightly higher than its longtime rival.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Dividend Journey\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper, in its current form, is a much younger company. It was established in 2018 following the merger of Keurig Green Mountain Coffee and Dr Pepper Snapple. Despite its shorter history as a combined entity, KDP has already shown a strong commitment to dividend growth.\n\nUpon completion of the merger, KDP initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. In just six years, this has grown to $0.215 per share, representing a CAGR of 6.18%. More impressively, over the past three years, KDP\u2019s dividend growth rate has accelerated to 12.09%, outpacing both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo\u2019s 20-year CAGRs.\n\nCan Keurig Dr Pepper Match Its Rivals\u2019 Dividend Growth?\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to say definitively whether KDP can sustain the same level of dividend growth as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo over a 20-year period, there are several reasons to be optimistic about its potential:\n\nStory continues\n\nStrong Financial Performance: KDP\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings release showed solid results, with net sales up 3.4% and adjusted diluted EPS growing 11.8% year-over-year. The company also reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 guidance for mid-single-digit net sales growth and high-single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth.\n\nHealthy Payout Ratio: KDP\u2019s dividend payout ratio stands at 46%, which is lower than many of its consumer staples peers. This leaves room for future dividend increases without straining the company\u2019s finances.\n\nRobust Balance Sheet: With a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.43x, also lower than its peers, KDP has the financial flexibility to maintain and potentially grow its dividend while investing in growth opportunities.\n\nImpressive Growth Rates: Over the past three years, KDP has demonstrated strong compound annual growth rates in both revenue (7.83%) and earnings per share (13.9%), providing a solid foundation for future dividend increases.\n\nPositive Analyst Outlook: Recent analyst ratings from Truist Securities, UBS, and Wells Fargo have an average price target of $38.33, implying an 11.79% upside from current levels. This suggests confidence in KDP\u2019s future performance.\n\nDiversified Portfolio: KDP\u2019s diverse range of brands across coffee, soft drinks, and other beverages provides multiple avenues for growth and helps insulate the company from fluctuations in any single market segment.\n\nDo you think Keurig Dr Pepper could be the next dividend growth machine? Join the conversation in the new Cash Flow Alliance community.\n\nWhile matching the 20-year dividend growth records of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo is a tall order, Keurig Dr Pepper has shown promising signs in its early years as a combined entity. The company\u2019s strong financial performance, conservative payout ratio, and accelerating dividend growth rate over the past three years all point to its potential to become a dividend growth powerhouse in its own right.\n\nHowever, investors should keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future results. KDP will need to navigate changing consumer preferences, potential economic headwinds, and intense competition to maintain its growth trajectory. Nonetheless, for income-focused investors looking for exposure to the beverage industry, Keurig Dr Pepper presents an intriguing opportunity with its combination of current yield and potential for future dividend growth.\n\nAs always, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their individual financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. While Keurig Dr Pepper may not yet have the decades-long dividend growth track record of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, its early performance suggests it could be well on its way to joining the ranks of premier dividend growth stocks in the beverage industry.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors. First-time investors with EquityMultiple can now invest in the Ascent Income Fund with a reduced minimum of just $5,000.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this food and beverage company have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has lost 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.16 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.83 indicates a change of +8.2% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $22.68 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.6%. The $94.53 billion and $99.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.4% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $18.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.61 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was +5.92%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Although traders continue to be laser-focused on hyper-growth stocks for substantial gains, astute investors also love dividend holding stocks. While growth stocks offer high rewards, most of them come with higher risks. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for investors to diversify and also buy dividend-giving stocks to ensure stability with dependable gains during market volatility.\n\nStability and dependability are more important to some investors than others. But companies that can continue to grow their cash flows and see their revenue and earnings tick up consistently over time are among the stocks I think investors should be more interested in right now.\n\nThere are plenty of speculative plays in the market for those looking to add risk to consider. However, these following blue-chip stocks provide the kind of growth most are looking for, with far less risk.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in New York, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is known for its wide range of beverage products. Pepsi is also a snack giant, continuing to expand its portfolio of affordable luxuries for consumers around the world.\n\nThis diversification strategy has paid out well, with many now viewing Pepsi as more a play on the broader consumer discretionary sector than as a pure-play on the beverage space (as competitor Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is often viewed.\n\nAnd from a cash flow perspective, it\u2019s harder to find a better option. This diversified company has relatively high margins, driven by some of the best pricing power in its segment.\n\nAnd unlike Coca-Cola, PepsiCo owns its production facilities, enhancing profitability despite high costs. In recently years, the company has posted strong bottom-line growth and dividend performance.\n\nThus, for those looking for a long-term consumer discretionary stock to own, I think Pepsi is a great pick here.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B) Warren Buffett in the background behind a phone showing the Berkshire Hathaway logo\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/QubixStudio\n\nIn 1965, Warren Buffett came into the game as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). And ever since, the firm has been known for its strategic investment prowess and ability to pick winners. With a long-term average compounded capital appreciation near 20%, Berkshire Hathaway is clearly one of the best examples of how investors can consistently beat the market over long periods of time.\n\nOf course, given the firm\u2019s size, there are now questions as to whether this can continue. Nevertheless, the company\u2019s focus on paying reasonable prices for excellent businesses (rather than excellent prices for decent businesses) sets it apart.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s portfolio is what I\u2019d call recession-resistant, and is one long-term investors should consider. The company owns a range of ordinary businesses, and a selection of high-growth stocks (some tech) as well. It\u2019s a portfolio that can stand the test of time. So, for investors looking to do the same, this is a stock to load up on during any major dips.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the companies Berkshire Hathaway also puts its money in is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Unlike its peers in the utilities sector, OXY stock has remained resilient despite industry challenges. This is the best time to add Occidental Petroleum. And that\u2019s not only because Buffett is betting so heavily on this stock.\n\nIn Q1 of 2024, the company reported strong production of 1,172 Mboed and $2.4 billion in operating cash flow. OXY has expectations of $1 billion more in annual free cash flow by mid-2026, supported by potential oil price gains. Also, the company is prioritizing debt reduction and expanding into low-carbon projects. This includes the TerraLithium extraction and partnerships with TAE Technologies.\n\nWith its aggressive acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, Buffett\u2019s backing is also a strong reason to put faith in OXY stock. In my view, this is just one of Buffett\u2019s long-term holdings that are worth adding as independent positions as well as doubling down on.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Q1 Earnings Outperformers: PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) And The Rest Of The Beverages and Alcohol Stocks\n\nAs the Q1 earnings season wraps, let's dig into this quarter's best and worst performers in the beverages and alcohol industry, including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and its peers.\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nThe 13 beverages and alcohol stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 15.8% below consensus. Valuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. The start of 2024 has been a different story as mixed signals have led to market volatility, and while some of the beverages and alcohol stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 4.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nWith a history that goes back more than a century, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a household name in food and beverages today and best known for its flagship soda.\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $18.25 billion, up 2.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. It was a mixed quarter for the company:\u00a0PepsiCo blew past analysts' organic revenue growth expectations. Its EPS narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its operating margin missed analysts' expectations and its gross margin missed Wall Street's estimates.

        "title": "The Nasdaq Is Soaring, but These 3 Stocks Are Near Their 52-Week Lows",
        "content": "If you're looking for good deals in the stock market, you may want to consider currently underperforming investments with lots of long-term upside. One way to spot these types of stocks is to narrow your search to the ones that are near their 52-week lows. Generally, there's some bad news or a troubling outlook involved with these companies, which can make them risky buys. But if they prove their doubters wrong, they could provide you with better-than-expected returns.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ: INTC), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) are all down year to date, but they still could turn out to be good investments to hold in the years ahead.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel is proof that simply being a chipmaker isn't a recipe for a surging share price this year, despite all the hype around artificial intelligence (AI). With its shares down by 40% since January, it's clear investors aren't excited about the company's prospects.\n\nIts revenue growth rate was a fairly modest 9% in the first quarter. More concerning, however, was its net loss of $437 million -- though that was at least a big improvement from the prior-year period, when Intel booked a net loss of $2.8 billion.\n\nI'm optimistic that Intel can turn things around given the need for the U.S. to build up its domestic chip manufacturing capacity. Currently, U.S. tech companies are heavily dependent on overseas foundries, and the government is providing big incentives and support to make it easier for domestic companies to succeed in this area and become significant suppliers of chips in the future.\n\nIt'll require some patience, but with Intel's management focused on reducing costs and pursuing the opportunities in manufacturing computer chips, this could make for a great contrarian investment to hang on to, provided that you're OK with accepting some risk. Currently, the tech company's stock is trading within a dollar of its 52-week low of $29.73.\n\n2. Cisco Systems\n\nNetworking and IT infrastructure giant Cisco could make for a good long-term buy. As companies upgrade their infrastructure to meet the growing needs of their AI-powered computers, demand for Cisco's products and services will likely rise. It provides solutions that cater to emerging AI trends, including AI-powered security and software options to help businesses get the most out of their next-gen technologies.\n\nThe problem is that it may take a while for much of that demand to materialize because companies are likely being selective about what they're spending money on in the current high-interest-rate environment. Keeping costs down will remain a priority for businesses until borrowing conditions improve. For the time being, Cisco may have a tough road ahead. The company's product revenues declined by 19% to just over $9 billion in its fiscal third quarter, which ended April 27.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt a time when investors are focused on stocks that are already benefiting from AI's growth, Cisco simply isn't standing out. However, that may change, and buying the stock before that happens could lead to some great returns for investors in the long run. Cisco hit a new 52-week low this week, and its price may get worse before it gets better.\n\n3. PepsiCo\n\nRaising prices has allowed PepsiCo to deliver strong returns amid inflation. However, as inflation cools down and the company's upcoming quarters are measured against the impressive comparable numbers from those prior periods, it seems probable that PepsiCo's growth rate will slow down.\n\nIn the fiscal quarter that ended March 23, the company's revenues rose by just 2% to $18.3 billion. That's not the type of growth that excites investors, especially for a stock that's trading at 25 times trailing earnings. A year ago, revenues were growing at a rate of more than 10%.\n\nBut prices are sticky and while they were quick to rise, they may not come down much from their current levels. And at higher price points and better margins, PepsiCo could be poised for continued growth in the long run as consumers come to accept the new elevated prices for the company's products. And as demand increases as economic conditions improve, PepsiCo should get back to growing at a higher rate.\n\nThere will likely continue to be some softness in the short term, but this stock can provide investors with great value in the long run. PepsiCo is trading just 6% above its 52-week low of $155.83 per share. And with a dividend that yields 3.3% at today's share price, investors may want to buy it not only for its reduced price but also to lock in that generous yield.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "4 Reasons to Buy Celsius Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "By disrupting the energy drink duopoly owned by Red Bull and Monster, functional energy drink upstart Celsius(NASDAQ: CELH) has grown to account for 11.5% of its industry's U.S. sales -- becoming the only new brand to reach this mark in the last decade.\n\nNow firmly the No. 3 brand in the energy drink space, Celsius is larger than the No. 4 and No. 5 labels combined. It's grown from a mere 3.5% share of its category two years ago to its current double-digit level, and the company has seen its share price more than double since 2022.\n\nNow, with the company's share price down 35% over the last month due to short-term worries, the time looks right to buy Celsius, thanks to these four key reasons.\n\n1. Celsius is unlocking new opportunities with PepsiCo\n\nAfter signing a massive agreement with beverage giant PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) in 2022, Celsius finally gained the distribution heft it needed to launch its sales into full hypergrowth mode. It averaged triple-digit sales growth in the two years following the deal. The company has picked most of the low-hanging fruit after joining PepsiCo's network. However, there should be plenty of growth remaining in this distribution agreement.\n\nFirst, building upon its land-and-expand strategy, Celsius now looks to execute the \"expand\" portion of this game plan by growing the display space it has in all the new stores it recently entered with PepsiCo's help. In highlighting this point in its first-quarter 2024 earnings press release, management explained: \"We estimate that retailers' spring shelf resets were approximately one-third complete as of March 31st, and once concluded, we are expecting our best shelf space gains in company history.\"\n\nAt an investor conference on June 11, CEO John Fieldy explained that labor shortages have led to delays on these shelf resets, but that gains should be evident over the summer and fall quarters.\n\nSecond, partnering with PepsiCo has opened Celsius up to the food service channel. Case volume for this vertical grew by 186% in Q1 and already accounts for 12% of Celsius' total sales made to PepsiCo. Not only will this burgeoning channel bring sales growth, but it should also increase brand awareness for Celsius drinks as they continue to become more common across a broader array of locations. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n2. Top-notch margins\n\nWhat makes Celsius' incredible sales growth over the last few years all the more impressive is that it already boasts a 19% net profit margin. While this profitability is relatively new, with the company only breaking even in 2023, it already ranks favorably compared to some of its massive beverage peers -- an incredible feat considering the company's rapid growth.\n\nStory continues CELH Profit Margin Chart\n\nThis robust net profit margin is a promising sign for shareholders, as high profitability tends to indicate pricing power for brands with loyal customer bases.\n\nIn addition, reaching profitability means that Celsius is now self-sufficient regarding its growth and will have excess cash to spend on potentially rewarding shareholders or expanding internationally.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\n3. International growth ambitions just starting\n\nAfter signing several distribution agreements with Japanese beverage giant Suntory early in 2024, Celsius plans to expand into Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, and France. Similarly, the company recently started selling in Canada after expanding its distribution agreement with PepsiCo.\n\nWith international sales only accounting for 5% of the company's total revenue, these foreign markets could represent the next chapter of the Celsius growth story. To put the length of this growth runway for Celsius in perspective, consider that energy drink peer Monster generated 37% of its total sales from international markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe company generated $16 million in international sales in its latest quarter, compared to Monster's $637 million. Celsius could have decades of growth remaining in front of it should it continue to disrupt the energy drink industry globally.\n\n4. A more reasonable valuation\n\nWith the company's share price down 35% in the last month due to short-term worries about a few weeks of sales data, the time might be right for long-term investors to reconsider adding to their Celsius position. While the company still trades at a lofty 57 times forward earnings, this is much more reasonable than the mid-80s figure it traded at one month ago. CELH PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWhile this is nearly three times the S&P 500's forward P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of 21, analysts expect Celsius to grow its bottom line by 40% in 2024, compared to just 9% for the index as a whole.\n\nUltimately, despite its premium valuation, the four factors listed here show that Celsius still has plenty of room to run -- but investors should be ready for a turbulent ride along the way.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in PepsiCo (PEP) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nPepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 57.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PEP Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEP\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in PEP?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $8.16.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(BRK.B), Eli Lilly Co. LLY and PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. HOV and IDT Corporation IDT.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly and PepsiCo\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Eli Lilly and Co. and PepsiCo, Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. and IDT Corporation. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today's research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hathaway's shares were in line with the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the year-to-date period (+13.8% vs. +13.8%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nContinued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\r\n\r\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+52.0% vs. +21.8%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly's new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends. Lilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly's top line in 2024.\r\n\r\nLilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer's. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)\r\n\r\nPepsiCo's shares have underperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (-2.4% vs. +2.2%). The company witnessed soft sales trends in the QFNA segment due to recent product recalls. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, PepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in core categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PEP's international business continues to hallmark its overall performance, delivering significant volume and organic revenue growth in the first quarter. These factors along with robust pricing aided PepsiCo's earnings and organic revenues first-quarter 2024. The company's productivity and cost-management initiatives bode well.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Hovnanian have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry over the past year (+54.5% vs. +34.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $920.57 million has substantially improved its financial health, reducing debt from $2.5 billion to under $1 billion as of the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nIts aggressive growth in controlled lots, which rose 29% year over year to 36,841 at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and a planned community count increase of 5-10% by year-end will support revenue growth. The company targets niche markets like active adults and innovates in-home designs, ensuring solid sales potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hovnanian faces legal risks from litigation and regulatory challenges, especially in environmental issues. The competitive homebuilding market threatens market share and profitability, exacerbated by the dependency on volatile housing market conditions. A declining contract backlog could affect the company's profitability and growth.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Hovnanian here >>>)\r\n\r\nIDT's shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry over the past year (+38.6% vs. -9.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $929.95 million is innovating its B2B2X financial services and leveraging digital payments, enhancing operational efficiency with a notable rise in NRS EBITDA margin from 1% to 20%.\r\n\r\nDT's NRS segment reported $82 million in recurring revenues with a 30% year-over-year increase, driven by a suite of merchant services. The POS network grew 28% to 28,700 terminals, tapping into a TAM of 200,000 retailers. BOSS Money's remittance service saw a 42% revenue uptick, boosting the fintech space.\r\n\r\nChallenges include regulatory risks in fintech, reliance on volatile segments like Traditional Communications for cash flow, and intense competition in POS and remittance markets. Macroeconomic factors and one-time costs may impact profitability. Despite growth, concerns about expense management and the unpredictability of new investments could affect investor sentiment.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on IDT here >>>)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Atmos Energy, Pinnacle West Capital, California Water Service, Utz Brands and PepsiCo",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 June 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Atmos Energy Corp. ATO, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, California Water Service Group CWT, Utz Brands, Inc. UTZ and PepsiCo, Inc. PEP.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Low-Beta Stocks to Buy as Fed Indicates One Rate Cut in 2024\n\nExpectations of multiple interest rate cuts in 2024 had faded long back and now the Federal Reserve has almost assured that it isn't going to happen anymore.\n\nOn Jun 12, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in the post-FOMC meeting statement that the central bank sees the possibility of only a single rate cut this year, sharply down from three rate cuts hinted earlier this year.\n\nThis came as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in its June FOMC meeting in its current range of 5.25-5.5%.\n\nAlthough inflation slowed somewhat in April and maintained its declining pace in May, the Federal Reserve maintains a hawkish stance as it is still sharply higher than the Fed's 2% target. Powell acknowledged that inflation has declined sharply over the past year but remains elevated.\n\nPowell's comments didn't impact investors much as it was expected that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates unchanged. Also, markets started pricing in a single 25 basis point rate cut this year over the past few weeks. In fact, several economists predicted no rate cuts this year.\n\nAlso, the latest \"dot plot\" from the FOMC meeting suggested a potential total rate cut of 1% by 2025. Consequently, the terminal rate of the Fed funds rate is currently projected to reach 4.1% by the end of 2025.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve's forecast for the long-term interest rate, which serves as a benchmark that neither stimulates nor constrains growth, has been revised up to 2.8% from an earlier projection of 2.6%. This indicates that Fed officials are leaning toward a perspective of maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period.\n\nOur Picks\n\nGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples. Five such stocks are Atmos Energy Corp., Pinnacle West Capital Corp., California Water Service Group, Utz Brands, Inc. and PepsiCo, Inc..\n\nAlso, these stocks belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1).

        "title": "RH Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected, Revenues Decrease Y/Y",
        "content": "RH RH shares plunged 10.7% in the after-hours trading session on Jun 13 after it reported tepid earnings for first-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended May 4, 2024).\r\n\r\nThe top line marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the bottom line significantly missed the same. Both the metrics declined on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nWhile RH expects business conditions to remain challenging until interest rates ease and the housing market begins to rebound, it expects demand trends to accelerate throughout fiscal 2024.\n\nEarnings, Revenue & Margin Discussion\n\nThe company reported an adjusted loss of 40 cents per share, which missed the consensus mark of a loss of 8 cents by a whopping 400%. Importantly, the reported figure also decreased from the year-ago period\u2019s earnings of $2.21 per share.\n\nRH Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise RH Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nRH price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | RH Quote\n\nAdjusted net revenues of $727 million slightly came ahead of the consensus mark of $725 million but fell 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. Demand was up 3% in the quarter, slightly below the guided range due to interest rates exceeding 7% post the hawkish Fed\u2019s commentary throughout April.\r\n\r\nGross margin contracted 350 basis points (bps) to 43.5% in the reported quarter. Adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses increased 490 bps to 37% of total revenues.\r\n\r\nAdjusted operating margin contracted 840 bps year over year to 6.5%. Adjusted EBITDA declined 39.2% year over year to $89.1 million for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 750 bps year over year to 12.3%.\n\nBalance Sheet & Cash Flow\n\nAt the first quarter of fiscal 2024-end, RH\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $101.8 million compared with $123.7 million at the end of fiscal 2023. The company ended first-quarter fiscal 2024 with merchandise inventories worth $802.2 million compared with $754.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nRH ended the quarter with a net debt of $2.38 billion and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.8x.\r\n\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $56.1 million in first-quarter fiscal 2024 compared with $86.7 million in the year-ago period. Free cash flow totaled negative $10.13 million in fiscal first quarter versus $52.55 million a year ago.\r\n\r\nAdjusted capital expenditures for the reported period were $75.04 million compared with $43.8 million a year ago.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor fiscal 2024, RH expects demand growth of 12-14% and revenue growth of 8-10% year over year. It also projects an adjusted operating margin in the range of 13-14% and an adjusted EBITDA margin between 18% and 19%.\r\n\r\nRH is forecasting to end fiscal 2024 with an increased backlog of $110-$130 million as revenues lag demand throughout 2024. This will negatively impact the adjusted operating and EBITDA margin by approximately 140 bps for the year. Additionally, investments and startup costs to support its international expansion are estimated to be approximately 200 bps for 2024.\r\n\r\nFor the fiscal second quarter, RH expects demand to grow in the range of 9-10% and revenues to rise in the band of 3-4%. It anticipates an adjusted operating margin in the band of 11-12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin in the 17-18% range.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nRH currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\r\n\r\nWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staple sector, namely Freshpet, Inc. FRPT, Vital Farms, Inc. VITL and PepsiCo Inc. PEP.\r\n\r\nFreshpet, a pet food company, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 118.2%, on average.

VITL currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 102.1%, on average.\r\n\r\nThe consensus estimate for Vital Farms\u2019 current financial-year sales and earnings per share indicates growth of 22.5% and 59.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo, a leading global food and beverage company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Move Over Pepsi, There's Officially a New No. 2 Soda Behind Coca-Cola",
        "content": "For well over a century, The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) and Pepsico(NASDAQ: PEP) -- or the Pepsi-Cola Company as it was previously called -- have been locked in a struggle for carbonation supremacy. This struggle is sometimes called the Cola Wars. For 40 years, little has changed. That is, until now.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Dr Pepper -- from beverage company Keurig Dr Pepper(NASDAQ: KDP) -- has now pulled even with Pepsi for the second spot on the carbonated beverage charts. And if you adjust for enough decimal places, Dr Pepper is technically ahead by a hair.\n\nPepsi briefly took the top spot in the 1980s during Coca-Cola's New Coke fiasco, according to Beverage Digest. However, Pepsi fell back to second place and has stayed there for nearly 40 years. But Dr Pepper has steadily chipped away at Pepsi's lead.\n\nAccording to Beverage Digest data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal, Pepsi had 13.5% market share compared to market share of just 6.3% for Dr Pepper as recently as the year 2000. But in 2023, both Pepsi and Dr Pepper enjoyed an 8.3% market share. For its part, Coca-Cola sits safely out in front with a 19.2% market share.\n\nHere's what this means and doesn't mean for investors.\n\nWhy Keurig Dr Pepper stock is worth a look\n\nUnderstand that when Dr Pepper is named the holder of second place, it refers to the brand's sales volume. However, Keurig Dr Pepper owns and licenses many brands besides Dr Pepper, including 7UP, Green Mountain Coffee, Canada Dry, Swiss Miss, and many more.\n\nThese brands give Keurig Dr Pepper a diverse portfolio across carbonated beverages and coffee. Today, Dr Pepper brand sales are growing as it takes market share. But tomorrow's growth could come from elsewhere in the portfolio -- that's why having a broad portfolio is a strength.\n\nOver the last five years, Keurig Dr Pepper's earnings per share (EPS) have more than doubled. And the company has grown its dividend at a faster rate than many of its peers. However, its price-to-earnings (P/E) valuation has been cut in half, meaning the stock has gone sideways. KDP EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nThe good news for investors today is that Keurig Dr Pepper stock is cheaper now than it was five years ago and the dividend yield is almost as high as it's ever been at 2.5%. Moreover, the company is still growing at a modest pace, which provides an opportunity for future earnings growth and rewarding shareholders.\n\nWhy Pepsi stock is worth holding\n\nJust as Keurig Dr Pepper has a strong portfolio of brands, so too does Pepsi. In fact, while the Pepsi brand has slipped to third place among carbonated beverages, the company still owns two more beverages in the top nine -- Mountain Dew and Diet Pepsi.\n\nStory continues\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper stock might be a better deal than Pepsi stock today. That said, Pepsi might have the stronger business because it doesn't only have a portfolio of beverages, it also has a portfolio of snacks. And the snack portfolio is a major contributor to profits.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Frito-Lay North America accounted for 57% of Pepsi's operating profit. The company doesn't break out snack sales in international markets. But accounting for those international sales elevates Pepsi's snacking profits even more.\n\nPepsi might have slipped to third place when it comes to carbonated beverages, and Dr Pepper fans should rightly take a victory lap. However, Pepsi's shareholders shouldn't panic because the business is still strong, thanks to its product diversity.\n\nMoreover, Pepsi is still growing its profits, thanks to particular strength in international markets.\n\nWhat it all means\n\nDr Pepper's second-place finish in 2023 is a fun headline. However, in isolation, it doesn't constitute a good reason to buy Keurig Dr Pepper stock. Those who buy today need to believe that the company can grow its portfolio both domestically and internationally. And they should believe that the company can continue growing profits and increasing what it gives back to shareholders.\n\nFor what it's worth, I believe those are reasonable assumptions.\n\nI also believe it's reasonable for Pepsi investors to continue holding their shares. Yes, Pepsi itself is technically in third place now. But this isn't a business in decline. It's one of the biggest and most important consumer companies in the world, and it can continue with good shareholder returns over the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Keurig Dr Pepper right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "3 Oversold Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Before the June Blast-Off",
        "content": "Blue-chip stocks are always the best choice if you\u2019re looking for big gains without loading up on speculative stocks. The oversold blue-chip stocks to buy provide more consistent upside for investors, with strong long-term growth opportunities.\n\nMost blue-chip stocks have proved themselves in terms of returns and long-term growth trajectories. After years of investing, the allure of high-growth stocks fades. Embracing stable or \u201cboring\u201d stocks becomes a wiser decision for investors nearing retirement, as capital preservation becomes a much more important goal.\n\nFor those with such a view, let\u2019s dive into these three oversold blue-chip stocks to buy before the market rally potentially kicks into gear in June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nLike its Magnificent Seven peer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), many thought Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) would take much longer to approach the $3 trillion value club. Currently, the company has a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion and continues to see strong upside momentum. If Alphabet\u2019s growth continues accelerating, a 36% move would bring this company into that club. It\u2019s certainly within the realm of possibility at this point.\n\nWith a strong global brand, Alphabet is an unstoppable blue-chip stock, with its YouTube and Google search engine segments driving consistent cash flow growth. Over the past year, the company generated $8.1 billion\u00a0and $9.6 billion in revenue from YouTube and Google. Moreover, the company consistently increases its free cash flow through diverse revenue streams. This diversification program continues, providing growth investors with new reasons to hold onto this stock for the long-term.\n\nAmong the key investment areas are AI technologies, specifically those that can be integrated into search. The company is redirecting resources to other projects with more immediate upside. Like the moves we\u2019re seeing with other blue-chip tech stocks, investors have reason to believe this strategic refocus will pay off, given Alphabet\u2019s long-term track record.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nFor over 50 years, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has been in the beverage sector. It has grown into a global dividend aristocrat. The stock is currently trading around $163 per. A dip in stock price and the company\u2019s 52nd-straight dividend increase this past quarter have bolstered this strong yield.\n\nFrom an income perspective, there\u2019s a lot to like about Pepsi\u2019s position. The company\u2019s strong cash flow generation profile, driven by entrenched brands in defensive market areas, is very bullish for those taking a long-term view of the company and its sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite recent pullbacks, Wall Street remains bullish on the company, and I don\u2019t blame them. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have reiterated a buy rating and a $190 price target, implying more than 16% upside from here. In addition to the company\u2019s yield, investors could reap a 20% return over the next year if analysts are right about this company.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a major centralized cryptocurrency platform, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is now gaining prominence amid the growing adoption of digital currency. Cathie Wood, a big fan of the company, has put her money where her mouth is, buying millions of shares of COIN stock over the years. Coinbase is no longer the largest position in her portfolios. However, her dedication to the company and its long-term growth prospects is notable.\n\nCoinbase\u2019s recent surge this past year can be tied to a market recovery driven by key catalysts. We had the April Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event, approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs and strong capital inflow data into the crypto sector. Retail investors have also begun to trade as they once did. This drives the company\u2019s trading fee revenue to new highs amid the onset of what many believe are a historic crypto bull market underway.\n\nCoinbase, a crypto exchange, increased its lobbying efforts before the November U.S. elections by donating $25 million to Fairshake, a crypto-focused super PAC. CEO Brian Armstrong noted that the PAC and its affiliates raised $160 million this cycle. Armstrong emphasized supporting pro-crypto candidates to ensure crypto\u2019s political significance.\n\nAnalysts view Coinbase as a top way to play key long-term growth sectors. This option is great for those seeking higher returns with reasonable risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "After Plunging -8.71% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for PepsiCo (PEP)",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 8.7% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\n\nHere is How to Spot Oversold Stocks\n\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\n\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\n\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.\n\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\n\nHere's Why PEP Could Experience a Turnaround\n\nThe RSI reading of 29.83 for PEP is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand. 3-month RSI Chart for PEP\n\nThe RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for PEP has increased 0%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\n\nMoreover, PEP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

        "title": "1 Magnificent S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stock Down 16% to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Are you on the hunt for a new \"forever\" dividend stock? If so, you've probably already stumbled across beverage behemoth Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). The company's not only paid dividends like clockwork for decades now, but has also raised its annual dividend payout every year for the past 62 years. You could certainly do worse than plugging into this blue chip ticker while it's yielding just a tad over 3%.\n\nYou could also do a little bit better, however. Shares of rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) offer a slightly higher dividend yield at this time, while the stock itself may offer more upside potential.\n\nPepsiCo isn't the company you might think it is\n\nDon't freak out if you already own a stake in Coke. You'll be fine. It's a proven player, too.\n\nIf you've only got room for one or the other in your portfolio right now, however, the 16% sell-off PepsiCo shares have suffered since peaking in early May makes it the better prospect at this time. At least some of this setback is simply the result of the stock going ex-dividend in the meantime, as well as recent reports that Dr. Pepper has caught up with Pepsi as the nation's second-favorite soda. Perhaps (or perhaps not) coincidentally, Pepsi's veteran marketing chief, Todd Kaplan, also recently stepped down to pursue an external opportunity.\n\nAre you surprised at the optimism in the face of obvious challenges? It would be a little surprising if at least some investors weren't. PepsiCo's supposed to be a reliable No. 2 player behind dominant Coca-Cola, after all.\n\nExcept, PepsiCo's not just a beverage business. It's not even mostly a beverage business. PepsiCo is also the name behind market-leading snack chip brands Frito-Lay and Quaker, which collectively account for nearly 60% of the company's revenue, and an even bigger proportion of its profits. Pepsi's failure to keep Dr. Pepper in check means even less given that each still only accounts for just a little more than 8% of the United States' soda market. Making it even less meaningful is the fact that PepsiCo is also a licensed bottler and distributor of the Dr. Pepper brand. It's benefiting from the rival drink's expansion as much as it's being hurt by it.\n\nIn other words, Dr. Pepper's growth isn't exactly a sign that Pepsi's in trouble.\n\nPepsiCo's secret long-term growth edge\n\nPerhaps more important to income-minded investors is the nature and quality of PepsiCo's business. It is more diversified than Coca-Cola's even if it is a lower-margin operation. But, it's also a lower-risk, higher-reward proposition.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow so? The explanation lies in the way Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are different.\n\nContrary to a common assumption, Coke does very little of its own bottling these days. It's spent the past several years selling its bottling operations to localized franchisees, which buy its flavored syrups and use its brand names. The model works, but its bottling partners are also customers trying to turn a profit of their own. The company and its affiliates aren't always necessarily on the same page when it comes to selling goods.\n\nThis is in contrast with PepsiCo, which remains more intimately involved with the production of its products -- drinks, and snacks, the latter market of which PepsiCo dominates here and abroad. Although the company utilizes third-party bottlers and food producers when merited, it also outright owns several production facilities. While these facilities can be expensive to operate (leading to the aforementioned narrower profit margins), this sort of structure ultimately gives PepsiCo better control of the entire procurement-to-distribution process.\n\nIn a crowded, competitive market like food and beverages, these unseen, qualitative details make a difference. The numbers confirm this. Although Coca-Cola has grown its per-share profits since regrouping from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, PepsiCo has grown its bottom line even more. Moreover, PepsiCo's per-share dividend has outgrown Coke's during the same time frame. KO Normalized Diluted EPS (Quarterly) Chart\n\nIt should be noted that at least some of PepsiCo's superior per-share metrics can be chalked up to the fact that the company is buying back its stock at a faster clip than its archrival.\n\nThe reason, however, is irrelevant. PepsiCo is creating more shareholder value than Coca-Cola, and is operating a snacks-led business that's capable of continuing to do so for the foreseeable future. Its 52-year streak of annual dividend increases isn't exactly in jeopardy, either.\n\nBigger doesn't necessarily mean better\n\nAgain, if you're instead a fan of Coca-Cola's bigger size, don't sweat it. You'll do fine with that pick as well.\n\nJust know that you may be able to do better with an investment in PepsiCo while its forward-looking dividend yield stands at 3.3%. Not only is it growing its dividend payments and profits at a faster clip than its bigger beverage competitor, PepsiCo stock's also been dishing out more capital appreciation than Coke shares have for a long while now. KO Chart\n\nBottom line? Believe what your eyes and the numbers are telling you. As unlikely as it seems that Coca-Cola isn't the best dividend stock pick in the beverage business, PepsiCo is the better option here specifically because -- despite most assumptions -- drinks aren't its core moneymaker. Dominating the snacks business means it's been able to grow more than most people would have ever imagined.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw PepsiCo (PEP) ending at $163.83, denoting a -0.75% adjustment from its last day's close. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 1.53%.\n\nThe food and beverage company's shares have seen a decrease of 8.23% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 2.81% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of PepsiCo in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 11, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.16, up 3.35% from the prior-year quarter. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $22.68 billion, reflecting a 1.59% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $8.16 per share and a revenue of $94.53 billion, indicating changes of +7.09% and +3.35%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.01% higher within the past month. Right now, PepsiCo possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, PepsiCo is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.22. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.97 of its industry.\n\nIt's also important to note that PEP currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.69. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.69 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 56, finds itself in the top 23% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "content": "3 Stocks That Could Make You A Dividend Millionaire\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nInvesting in stocks that have a track record of consistently growing their dividends over time can be a powerful wealth-building strategy. By reinvesting those dividends, if you don\u2019t need the income immediately, you can supercharge your returns and set yourself up for a substantial stream of passive income in the future.\n\nWhile becoming a dividend millionaire won\u2019t happen overnight, holding onto great dividend stocks for the long haul, reinvesting those dividends and adding to your positions when you can, has the potential to generate truly life-changing wealth.\n\nTake Warren Buffett\u2019s investment in Coca-Cola for example. Berkshire Hathaway started buying shares of Coca-Cola back in 1988, investing a total of $1.3 billion by 1994. Today, those 400 million shares are worth over $24.7 billion and are paying Berkshire a staggering $776 million in annual dividends \u2013 a nearly 60% yield on the original investment. Buffett\u2019s experience exemplifies the power of identifying high-quality companies, buying their stock and holding on for the long term.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three dividend stocks with strong brands, solid fundamentals and a history of dividend growth that could help you build your own dividend empire over time:\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nSpeaking of Buffett\u2019s big bet on Coke, the beverage giant is still a classic dividend growth stock. Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for an impressive 61 years straight, placing it in the elite Dividend Kings category. With a current yield of 3.05%, buying the stock today and holding for the long term could provide a substantial income stream down the road.\n\nCoca-Cola delivered solid Q1 2024 results driven by strong performance across many of its leading brands. The company also expects to deliver at least 4% organic revenue growth, at least 8% comparable currency neutral EPS growth, and $11.4 billion in cash flow from operations for full year 2024. With a strong brand portfolio, global scale, and a continued focus on innovation, Coca-Cola looks well-positioned to keep the dividend increases flowing.\n\nRealty Income Corp (NYSE:O)\n\nRealty Income, which bills itself as \u201cThe Monthly Dividend Company,\u201d is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns a vast portfolio of over 12,000 commercial properties. The REIT has an exceptional track record of paying reliable rising dividends, with 26 consecutive years of increases and a 5-year dividend growth rate of 3.55%. The current dividend yield is an attractive 6.03% paid out monthly.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, Realty Income saw revenues rise 10% as occupancy remained high at 98.6%. The company continues to use its scale and cost of capital advantages to acquire quality properties, investing $598 million in Q1 at a 7.8% initial cash yield. With a diversified, high-quality tenant base and a long-weighted average lease term around 9.8 years, Realty Income is built to deliver consistent cash flows and dividends.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s rival PepsiCo is another dividend growth star, with 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases under its belt. The current dividend yields an appetizing 3.28%. PepsiCo benefits from its diversification across beverages with brands like Pepsi, Gatorade and Aquafina, and foods like Frito Lay and Quaker.\n\nPepsiCo posted solid Q1 2024 numbers with organic revenue growth of 2.7% and core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. The company also reaffirmed its full-year outlook for 4% organic revenue growth and at least 8% core constant currency EPS growth. With its powerful brands, extensive global distribution, and ongoing investments in innovation, manufacturing, and pep+ sustainability initiatives, PepsiCo appears well-equipped to keep delivering solid results and dividend growth over time.\n\nGive Your Passive Income Stream a Boost\n\nStarting with higher-yielding investments (provided the payouts are sustainable) can be a game-changer for investors looking to speed up their journey to significant dividend income. For example, earning an 8% annual yield on a $10,000 investment would grow to over $22,000 in a decade, while a 12% yield would compound to $33,000. After 10 years at 12%, your original investment would be generating roughly 39.6% annually if you chose to start collecting the cash instead of reinvesting.\n\nTwo high-yield opportunities worth considering outside of the stock market are the Arrived Private Credit Fund and the Ascent Income Fund.\n\nArrived Private Credit Fund\n\nThe Arrived Private Credit Fund offers investors an opportunity to earn passive income by investing in a diversified pool of real estate-backed loans. With a target yield of 7-9% and a low minimum investment of just $100, the fund makes it easy for anyone to get started. The fund\u2019s strategy focuses on providing short-term financing for professional real estate projects like property renovations, rehabs or new home construction. All loans are secured by residential real estate, offering an added layer of protection. Investors can look forward to monthly dividend payouts, quarterly liquidity options and the potential for capital preservation. The Arrived Private Credit Fund could be an attractive choice for income-focused investors seeking to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional stocks and bonds.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Arrived Private Credit Fund\n\nAscent Income Fund\n\nThe Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle designed for income-focused investors seeking to generate consistent cash flows from real estate debt investments. With a historical distribution yield of 12.1%, the fund aims to provide investors with higher levels of income than many other fixed-income alternatives. The Ascent Income Fund primarily invests in senior positions in commercial real estate loans, giving it payment priority to enhance security. The fund also offers investors flexibility with quarterly redemption options after an initial one-year holding period. For a limited time, the minimum investment for the Ascent Income Fund has been reduced from $20,000 to $5,000 for first-time investors, making it more accessible to a broader range of people. Overall, the Ascent Income Fund could be a compelling option for yield-hungry investors who also want exposure to the real estate market.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple\n\nStay The Course\n\nWhile high yields are tempting, remember that successful dividend investing is a marathon, not a sprint. The most important ingredients are quality companies with enduring competitive advantages, long growth runways and shareholder-friendly management teams committed to sharing the wealth through rising payouts. By building a diverse portfolio of such companies, reinvesting the dividends and staying patient, you put yourself on the path to generating a bountiful passive income stream that could one day make you a dividend millionaire.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Because it\u2019s tied to one of the six leading causes of \u201cfinality,\u201d stress represents a silent public health crisis. And few things cause heightened stress than dealing with you-know-what at work. Therefore, the concept of financial freedom, retire early or FIRE has garnered significant momentum. To get there and to keep you there, we have some so-called FIRE stocks to discuss.\n\nWe\u2019re going to talk about an eclectic mix of ideas. In the first set of publicly traded enterprises, we\u2019ll focus on the FIRE stocks that may help accelerate your portfolio. If you\u2019re going to get out of the rat race early, you\u2019re going to need to ramp up your risk-reward profile \u2013 that\u2019s just the reality.\n\nFollowing that, we\u2019ll shift over into a few ideas that should be relevant for the long haul. These companies offer stable and predictable businesses that should frankly outlast you. That\u2019s good because you\u2019ll want to enjoy those dividends coming in.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThere\u2019s no better time to start your journey to independence than right now. With that, let\u2019s discuss FIRE stocks to buy.\n\nCeva (CEVA) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocks. Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe first idea on this list of FIRE stocks to consider is semiconductor specialist Ceva (NASDAQ:CEVA). Per its public profile, Ceva provides silicon and software intellectual property (IP) solutions to semiconductor and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) companies worldwide. It encompasses a range of connectivity solutions that tie in with the Internet of Things (IoT). It also features a specialization in artificial intelligence protocols, particularly in the development of networks for embedded devices.\n\nAs you know, AI has been all the rage, sparking robust upside in some of the world\u2019s top chipmakers. Fundamentally, a key benefit of CEVA stock is its size. Right now, shares trade at only $20.42 a pop, translating to a market capitalization of less than $482 million. Of course, this framework presents high risks. At the same time, once more investors become aware of the CEVA narrative, this thing could fly.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months, Ceva a net loss of $21.19 million or 90 cents per share in the red. Revenue hit $93.23 million. In fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate earnings per share of 27 cents, an improvement of 170%. On the top line, sales may reach $103.35 million, up 6.1%.\n\nPixelworks (PXLW) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAn extremely high-risk idea among FIRE stocks, Pixelworks (NASDAQ:PXLW) will require caution. On paper, the company along with its subsidiaries develops and markets semiconductor and software solutions for mobile, home and enterprise-level clients. It also serves the cinema markets in the U.S., Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea and Europe. Its specialty is in image-processing integrated circuits (ICs), particularly embedded microprocessors.\n\nStory continues\n\nInterestingly, Pixelworks utilizes AI to enhance resolution and overall image quality. Some of the main customers of the tech enterprise include mobile device manufactures, along with those which specialize in projectors. Further, Pixelworks offers relevancies for the gaming device and accessories market. Given the enormous popularity of this sector, PXLW should enjoy sustained relevance.\n\nAnalysts are very enthusiastic about the enterprise, rating shares a unanimous strong buy. Also, the price target stands at $2.50, implying about 144% upside potential.\n\nFinancially, during the TTM period, Pixelworks posted revenue of $65.77 million. In the most recent quarter, its growth rate year-over-year stood at 61.1%. Interestingly, fiscal 2024 may be a down year for the company. However, in fiscal 2025, sales could soar to $75.73 million, making PXLW an intriguing candidate for FIRE stocks.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) the CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Switzerland, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) falls under the advanced biotechnology field. Per its corporate profile, CRISPR is a gene-editing specialist, focusing on developing medicines addressing serious human diseases. Underlying the business is its CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) platform, which may facilitate precise directed changes to genomic DNA. It\u2019s controversial to be sure but the potential for the enterprise to address the human condition could be enticing.\n\nAnother element to consider is that CRISPR can pull off some surprises financially. Notably, ahead of the fourth quarter of 2023, analysts anticipated the biotech to produce a loss per share of 7 cents. Instead, the company posted EPS of $1.10, resulting in an earnings surprise of 1,671.4%.\n\nDuring the TTM period, CRISPR incurred a net loss of $217.14 million or $2.70 per share in the red. Revenue in the cycle hit $271.71 million. For fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate a down year in both earnings and sales. However, in fiscal 2025, the most optimistic analyst is calling for sales to hit $3.31 billion.\n\nThat could be a gamechanger. It could also send shares flying, making CRSP one of the possible FIRE stocks to consider.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the ultra-competitive world of buy now, pay later (or BNPL) platforms, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) appears to have lost a step. As a result, PYPL stock has only offered up a muted performance this year, gaining a little over 5%. That\u2019s nothing compared to other tech firms. More problematic is that since Sept. 2021, PYPL has looked like a sad shell of its former self.\n\nStill, the years-long downturn could make PYPL an intriguing opportunity. Most notably, the company offers significant relevance for the burgeoning gig economy. Following the disruption of the Covid-19 crisis, few people want to go back to business as usual. Those who have received an ultimatum have decided to branch out as independent contractors.\n\nSo, PayPal isn\u2019t just about competing in the crowded BNPL space. It also offers tremendous utility for gig workers. Financially, during the TTM period, the company posted net income of $4.34 billion or EPS of $3.97. Revenue hit $30.43 billion.\n\nLooking out to the end of the year, analysts anticipate EPS of $4.21 on sales of just under $32 billion. That would translate to top-line growth of 15%. It\u2019s one of the FIRE stocks to keep on your radar.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the speculation portion of your FIRE stocks into financial freedom, the next step is to stay free. For that, investors may want to consider beverage and snacks giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Now, with the obesity crisis sparking a rise in weight-loss drugs, some concerns exist that PEP may become irrelevant. Cynically, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThe obesity crisis didn\u2019t just materialize yesterday. No, it has been decades in the making, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. With Americans\u2019 sweet tooth combining with the aforementioned work-related stress, I see the obesity crisis worsening. It sounds terrible to say but that provides a \u201cpositive\u201d framework for enterprises like PepsiCo.\n\nPlus, PepsiCo specializes in caffeinated beverages. With the growth rate of energy drinks projected to rise above that of coffee, PEP should be viable as one of the FIRE stocks; that is, viable in the sense of staying retired.\n\nIt\u2019s a robust enterprise too. In the TTM period, net income reached $4.34 billion, translating to EPS of $3.97. Also, revenue in this cycle hit $30.43 billion. Finally, investors may enjoy the company\u2019s forward dividend yield of 3.28%.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top integrated oil and gas players in the world, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) covers all areas of the hydrocarbon value chain. Admittedly, though, that makes CVX one of the curious ideas for FIRE stocks. With the ideological and political machinery pushing for renewable energy infrastructure, Chevron seems an odd bet. Wouldn\u2019t CVX become woefully irrelevant as we all zip around in electric vehicles?\n\nWhile that future may finally arrive, I\u2019m not entirely sure that it will arrive soon. Until the nation overhauls the present infrastructure to accommodate EVs, anything close to full integration just won\u2019t happen. And it\u2019s not as if the government can one day force everyone to drive EVs. There are millions and millions of combustion-powered vehicles on U.S. roadways.\n\nI\u2019m not saying combustion cars are the future of mobility. However, going all-in on EVs is not as easy as the sector apologists make it out to be. Plus, you got to consider the robust profitability potential of Chevron, especially if critical supply chains become threatened.\n\nOh yeah \u2013 the company also offers a forward yield of 4.16%. That\u2019s something to think about.\n\nLTC Properties (LTC) A group of senior people having lunch together in a retirement home, LTC Properties operates senior housing and living facilities\n\nSource: Juice Flair / Shutterstock.com\n\nStructed as a real estate investment trust or REIT, LTC Properties (NYSE:LTC) invests in senior housing and healthcare properties. Primarily, LTC conducts business through sale-leasebacks, mortgage financing, joint ventures and structured financial solutions, including preferred equity and mezzanine lending. That\u2019s all great but the key here \u2013 lest we get off track \u2013 is senior housing.\n\nBasically, it comes down to demographic math. During the post-World War II baby boom, a massive increase of people materialized, for lack of a better word. With these folks rapidly entering their golden years, senior care has become a profoundly important issue. And so long as humans walk the earth, senior care is an infinite game. In other words, LTC is tied to a permanently relevant narrative.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that LTC itself is permanently relevant. But the concept of caring for older people is perpetual. Therefore, you can probably trust LTC more so than other REITs or standard corporations. Even with a bad miss in the second quarter last year, the average earnings surprise for LTC in the past four quarters came out to 0.35%.\n\nLastly, LTC offers a forward yield of 6.78% and it pays out monthly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "PepsiCo Inc: A Solid Choice for Income Investors?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nPepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a favorite among Wall Street analysts, and data shows that sophisticated investors are buying the stock in large quantities. As of June 2024, institutional investors own 73.9% of PepsiCo, indicating experts\u2019 confidence in the stock. However, income investors should carefully consider whether this stock is a good investment.\n\nPepsiCo is a dividend king that has consistently hiked quarterly dividends for the last 52 years. The stock currently offers a trailing yield of 3.27%, which is better than the industry average of 2.47%. However, its payout ratio of 82% is higher than the industry average of 66.39%, suggesting potential underinvestment in growth, which may hurt its dividend sustainability.\n\nDespite this concern, PepsiCo\u2019s strong balance sheet can likely sustain payments, even in slow growth periods. As of March 2024, the company had a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.41, compared to the industry average of 0.8. While this ratio is quite high, it is manageable given the company\u2019s $228 billion market cap and ability to raise capital to boost its balance sheet. Moreover, PepsiCo\u2019s net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.1 and interest coverage ratio of 15.8 times demonstrate its ability to sustain its debt.\n\nPepsiCo Inc. could be a great income stock, but its price remains vulnerable to the decisions of institutional investors. Therefore, investors looking for a stable income stream and growth should approach the stock with caution.\n\nLooking For High-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.27%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.31%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.88%.\n\nThe food and beverage company's shares have seen a decrease of 8.29% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 2.77% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.85%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on July 11, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.16, marking a 3.35% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $22.68 billion, up 1.59% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $8.16 per share and a revenue of $94.53 billion, demonstrating changes of +7.09% and +3.35%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for PepsiCo. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.01% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. PepsiCo is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLooking at valuation, PepsiCo is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 20.32. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 18.99, so one might conclude that PepsiCo is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that PEP currently holds a PEG ratio of 2.71. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Beverages - Soft drinks industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.71 as trading concluded yesterday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 53, finds itself in the top 22% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nDon't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Consumer Staples Stocks Set to Beat Earnings",
        "content": "Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. PepsiCo (PEP) earns a Zacks Rank #2 30 days from its next quarterly earnings release on July 11, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.17 a share.\n\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $2.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.16 Zacks Consensus Estimate, PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of 0.62%.\n\nPEP is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Smucker (SJM) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\n\nSmucker, which is readying to report earnings on September 3, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.22 a share, and SJM is 84 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nSmucker's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.03% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21.\n\nPEP and SJM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "The Stanley Cup final between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers began June 8. It\u2019s only appropriate, then, that I consider three hockey stocks to buy to celebrate the occasion.\n\nA Canadian team hasn\u2019t won the Cup since 1993 when the Montreal Canadiens beat the Los Angeles Kings in five games. The last time a Canadian team played in the Stanley Cup final was the Montreal Canadiens in 2021. These are both disheartening for this Canadian.\n\nMaybe this year, the Oilers will break through, ending the 31-year drought.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve got a job to do: Select three hockey stocks to buy for the long haul. A hockey stock, for the purposes of this article, are companies related to the NHL, either as sponsors or benefiting in some way from pro hockey.\n\nIn addition to the above criteria, I\u2019ll also try to restrict my picks to stocks in the S&P 500.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the NHL\u2019s official sponsor in the U.S. and Canada for the carbonated soft drinks, water, energy drinks and savory snack food categories. PepsiCo has been an NHL sponsor since 2006.\u00a0In 2022, the company extended its exclusive sponsorship with the NHL for at least another four years through 2026, extending the relationship with the NHL to two decades.\n\nPepsi\u2019s stock has been a major disappointment in recent years. Over the past five years, it\u2019s gained just 28%, significantly less than the 86% return for the index.\n\nOver the past three years, it\u2019s grown its revenue and operating income by 9.1% and 8.6%, respectively, while its return on invested capital is 15.9%, slightly less than Coca-Cola\u2019s (NYSE:KO) at 16.5%.\n\nIn recent years, PepsiCo has been very successful at raising prices without much of a dent in sales. In 2024, it expects 4% organic growth, a return to a more normal growth rate from 9.5% in 2023.\u00a0Areas of strength in Q1 2024 were in Mexico, Brazil, China and Australia, where organic sales increased by double digits.\n\nYielding 3.2%, it\u2019s an excellent dividend stock.\n\nFastenal (FAST) The blue Fastenal Co (FAST) logo is displayed on a white monitor screen.\n\nSource: Eyesonmilan / Shutterstock.com\n\nFastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) is the Official Supply Chain Solutions Partner of the NHL. The company provides NHL teams and arenas with products and services to help maximize the game experience for its loyal fans. It even provides custom tool carts for visiting NHL teams to ensure they have the right tools for their visit.\n\nLong-term, Fastenal has delivered for shareholders. Its five-year gain is 97%, 12 percentage points higher than the S&P 500. In early April, the gap was over 60 percentage points.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, slower demand was reported and discussed in its Q1 2024 earnings report. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s net sales grew 1.9% to $1.90 billion, while operating income fell 0.8% to $390.2 million.\u00a0In 2023, its onsite locations surpassed its store locations for the first time. As of March 31, it had 1,872 active sites, up nearly 12% from a year earlier.\n\nIts shares have dropped 12% since its Q1 2024 earnings report on April 11. As a result, director Dan Johnson acquired $229,100 in Fastenal stock (average price of $68.38). His previous purchase on the open market was $51,000 (average price of $51.01) in May 2022.\n\nIt became a Dividend Aristocrat in February.\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports (MSGS) Madison Square Garden during daylight. MSGE Stock\n\nSource: S-F / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou can\u2019t benefit from the NHL anymore than Madison Square Garden Sports (NYSE:MSGS), which owns the New York Rangers, the NBA\u2019s New York Knicks and several other sports teams. Its sister company, Madison Square Garden Entertainment (NYSE:MSGE) owns the Madison Square Garden in New York City, where the Rangers and Knicks play.\n\nAs Sportico noted in May, the company\u2019s enterprise value is deeply discounted to its estimated value of the NHL and NBA teams. MSGS\u2019s enterprise value is $5.62 billion, 43% less than the $9.88 billion combined value of the Rangers ($2.45 billion) and the Knicks ($7.43 billion).\n\nThe Dolan Family controls 71% of the stock. This control position causes the company\u2019s share price to trade at a discount. However, that\u2019s not to say Executive Chairman James Dolan hasn\u2019t created value for shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of confidence in Jim Dolan,\u201d John Miller, portfolio manager at Ariel Investments said.\u00a0\u201cHe has done really well over the decades to enhance shareholder value. He\u2019s a terrific visionary,\u201d Sportico\u2019s Kurt Badenhausen reported.\n\n\u201cAriel holds large positions in MSG Sports as well as other Dolan-controlled, MSG-related stocks: Madison Square Garden Entertainment and Sphere Entertainment, which also owns MSG Networks, in addition to the $2.3 billion Sphere venue.\u201d\n\nIf you want to invest in hockey stocks and the NHL, this is as close as you\u2019ll get from a public company perspective.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Dividend growth investing has proven to be an attractive investment strategy over time, and there are several strong ETFs that enable investors to invest in this theme. Two of the largest and most popular are the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:DGRO) and the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (NYSEARCA:DGRW). Both ETFs share a similar focus on high-quality dividend growth stocks and have performed well over the years.\n\nI am bullish on both ETFs, but in this article, we will compare DGRO and DGRW to determine which could be the better choice for investors.\n\nWhat Is the DGRO ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nAccording to iShares, DGRO invests in \u201can index composed of U.S. equities with a history of consistently growing dividends.\u201d\n\niShares also touts the fact that DRGO \u201coffers low-cost exposure to U.S. stocks focused on dividend growth\u201d and says that DGRO enables investors to \u201caccess companies that have a history of sustained dividend growth and that are broadly diversified across industries.\u201d\n\nThe fund launched in 2014 and has $27 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe Allure of Dividend Growth Investing\n\nDividend growth stocks may not feature the highest yields, but they grow their dividend payouts and are projected to do so in the future, which is a strong indicator of financial health.\n\nDividend growth stocks often offer a potentially attractive combination of returns from capital appreciation and dividend payouts. While their payouts may be lower than those of some high-yield dividend stocks, they often offer more growth potential than these high-yielding stocks, which may feature little in the way of growth or potential price appreciation.\n\nTo get a better understanding of why this strategy can be appealing, let\u2019s take a look at a stock like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which both funds hold, as we\u2019ll discuss below.\n\nWhile Broadcom only yields 1.4%, the company has increased its payout for 13 years in a row. The stock has returned an incredible 2,441% over the past 10 years on a total return basis, including capital appreciation and the reinvestment of the dividends it paid. While the yield may not be high, few investors would turn down that type of return.\n\nWhat Is the DGRW ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nDGRW has a similar focus. WisdomTree says that it invests in an index of \u201cdividend-paying large-cap companies with growth characteristics in the U.S. equity market.\u201d\n\nDGRW predates DGRO, having debuted in 2013, and is smaller, with $12.8 billion in AUM, but it is still a major dividend ETF.\n\nIt gives investors \u201caccess to the current investment landscape of U.S. large-cap dividend growing companies by applying quality and growth screens.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHead-to-Head Performance\n\nThese are both good ETFs that have posted solid returns for investors over time. As of the end of May,\u00a0DGRO has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.9% and an annualized return of 12.3% over five years.\n\nFor comparison, DGRW has produced an annualized return of 10.65% over the past three years and an annualized return of 15.47% over the past five.\n\nComparing the Portfolios\n\nDGRO offers investors great diversification, with positions in 419 different stocks. Furthermore, its top 10 holdings make up just 26.7% of assets, so it isn\u2019t exposing investors to much concentration risk.\n\nBelow, you\u2019ll find an overview of DGRO\u2019s top 10 holdings using TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nDGRO owns a mix of large-cap growth stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that pay dividends, coupled with more traditional dividend stocks like energy giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX).\n\nDGRW is also well-diversified, although a bit less so than DGRO, and a bit more concentrated. DGRW owns 299 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 37.3% of the fund.\n\nYou can check out an overview of DGRW\u2019s top 10 holdings below.\n\nLike DGRO, DGRW owns a mix of large-cap growth stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that pay dividends. These are mixed with more traditional longtime dividend stalwarts like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP).\n\nThe top holdings of both funds have a similar style in this regard, and there is plenty of overlap. In fact, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Procter & Gamble, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) all feature in the top 10 holdings for both funds.\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Smart Score system also takes a favorable view of each fund\u2019s top holdings.\u00a0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Eight out of DGRO\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and eight out of DGRW\u2019s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores.\n\nDGRO enjoys an Outperform-Equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10, and DGRW has the same rating.\u00a0All in all, these two funds are on pretty even footing when it comes to their holdings.\n\nDividend Yields\n\nWith both funds boasting solid performance track records in recent years and highly-rated portfolios, there isn\u2019t too much separating them. However, dividend yield is one area where one has a discernible advantage over the other. While DGRW yields just 1.6%, DGRO\u2019s yield comes in higher at 2.3%, making it the clear choice in this category.\n\nNow, you may be thinking that neither of these yields sounds that great. And while they aren\u2019t particularly high, it\u2019s important to remember that these aren\u2019t necessarily high-yield dividend funds. They are focused on dividend growth and a combination of returns from both dividends and capital appreciation, and they have been effective in this regard, as we saw in the total return section.\n\nPlus, the dividends of the stocks these funds focus on are expected to grow over time, so while the yields aren\u2019t particularly high, investors can reasonably expect the levels of the dividend payouts to increase over time.\n\nFee Comparison\n\nThe other area where DGRO pulls away from DGRW is when it comes to their fees. To be clear, both ETFs are very reasonable in this department, but DGRO\u2019s 0.08% expense ratio is much lower than DGRW\u2019s 0.28%. These expense ratios mean that an investor putting $10,000 into DGRO will pay $8 in fees annually, while an investor in DGRW will pay $28.\n\nAgain, these are both reasonable numbers, but DGRO has the clear advantage. The discrepancy between the two also becomes more pronounced over time. Assuming that each fund maintains its current expense ratio and gains 5% per year going forward, the investor in DGRO will pay just $103 in fees over 10 years, while the investor in DGRW will pay $356.\n\nWe Have a Winner\n\nThese are both similarly focused funds with strong portfolios of highly-rated dividend growth stocks and solid track records of performance. While both are likely good choices for investors, I\u2019m more bullish on DGRO and choose it as the winner in this comparison between these two high-powered ETFs because of its higher yield and lower expense ratio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 Jun 10, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights PepsiCo PEP, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Tenet Healthcare THC.\n\nKnow the \"Big Three\" Investing Styles: Income, Value and Growth\n\nMany different investing styles are deployed, as investors have their individual preferences. Still, market participants typically gravitate toward one of three strategies: income, growth or value.\n\nEach style caters to different investor profiles. Income investors seek passive income from dividend payouts or other income-generating assets, growth investors seek to reap market-beating gains from companies expected to grow at an above-average level, and value investors look for discounted market opportunities.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer dive into each strategy.\n\nIncome Investing\n\nIncome investing is all about reaping passive income. Those who follow this style typically invest in dividend-paying stocks, bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other securities that offer regular income.\n\nConcerning individual stocks, the elite group of Dividend Aristocrats has long been a favorite among income-focused investors. To join the elite Dividend Aristocrats group, companies must be part of the S&P 500 and increase their dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years.\n\nA 25-year streak of increased payouts is no easy feat, owing to these companies\u2019 abilities to operate reliably in the face of many economic environments over the years. A famous example of a Dividend Aristocrat is PepsiCo, which currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nThe style is primarily geared toward more conservative investors, with dividend-paying stocks commonly carrying decreased volatility.\n\nGrowth Investing\n\nGrowth investing is a highly common strategy, with investors targeting companies expected to grow their earnings and revenues at an above-average level. It\u2019s a development that commonly follows through to share outperformance.\n\nThese companies typically reinvest their earnings back into the business for expansion, allowing them to achieve meaningful scaling efficiencies. Many are at the forefront of innovation, developing new technologies or disrupting traditional industries with new business models. A great example of this has been NVIDIA over the last year, with Tesla a better example of the last decade.\n\nHigh-growth companies generally trade at rich valuation multiples, reflecting the high growth expected. Of course, this strategy is more volatile than the rest, as the long-term picture can change rapidly.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowth investing is styled more toward investors who can handle increased volatility with a longer investment horizon.\n\nValue Investing\n\nValue investing involves buying stocks at a \u2018discount\u2019, with the idea that the market will eventually \u2018catch up\u2019 and recognize their true value, which can lead to serious gains. After all, we all enjoy a good deal.\n\nThese stocks are typically priced lower than their peers in terms of valuation ratios like price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-book (P/B), and price-to-sales (P/S), among others.\n\nThe strategy requires patience above all else, as it may take a significant amount of time until investors \u2018catch up\u2019 and realize the stock\u2019s intrinsic value. Tenet Healthcare is an example of a stock sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Value Style Score of \u2018A.\u2019\n\nBottom Line\n\nThere are many investing styles deployed, with the most common being income, growth, or value-oriented. Income investors seek steady payouts, growth investors seek companies expected to grow at an above-average pace, and value investors seek deals hidden in plain sight.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "7 Reliable Stocks That Deliver Come Rain or Shine",
        "content": "The stock market is unpredictable, and it is impossible to time it. Inflation, recession, low consumer spending and geopolitical issues can\u00a0impact\u00a0your investment portfolio. If you react to these market fluctuations, you could\u00a0either buy too high or sell too low. This is when smart investors hold tight to the stocks that can deliver, no matter how the market\u00a0moves. These are reliable stocks that do not fluctuate with every market movement.\n\nWhen you have a portfolio of stalwarts that keep delivering rain or shine, you never have to worry about your portfolio underperforming. Here are seven reliable stocks that can deliver in all market situations, and you will never regret owning them. With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at these stocks.\n\nColgate Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne solid reason to add Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) to your portfolio is the massive range of products it owns. Many families tend to use the same consumer brands for years. This could be a preference or a habit, but Colgate Palmolive also benefits from this. It owns well-known brands, including Colgate toothpaste\u00a0and\u00a0other personal hygiene products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith a dividend yield of 2.13%, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the most reliable stocks that will continue to perform regardless of market moves. Trading at $93, the stock is up 16% year-to-date and is moving towards the 52-week high of $95.\n\nThe stock has soared 24% in the past 12 months, and believe buying CL stock below $100 is a smart move. The company has increased dividends annually for over six decades and\u00a0has enough liquidity to keep doing so.\n\nAfter beating analyst expectations in the first quarter, management raised the outlook for FY2024 and expects sales growth\u00a0of\u00a02% to 5%. It reported revenue of $5.07 billion and an EPS of 86 cents.\n\nPepsi (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nBeverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has existed for over 50 years and has seen several market ups and downs. As one of the most popular companies, PepsiCo has a global presence and is a dividend aristocrat.\n\nBesides being acclaimed as an ideal stock for passive income investors, PepsiCo has a diversified business with multiple brands, including Frito-Lay snacks and Aquafina under its umbrella. This ensures steady revenue growth over the years.\n\nTrading at $173, the stock has been up 29% in the past five years. It has a dividend yield of 3.13% and increased the dividend by 7% in the recent quarter, which is its 52nd consecutive increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this may not be a huge surge\u00a0compared to the tech stocks, PepsiCo offers stability and reliability. The company enjoys pricing power and has a robust cash flow that can reward patient investors. The stock has recently pulled back; this is your time to pounce. PepsiCo will provide a cushion in uncertain times.\n\nPost-earnings, Morgan Stanley called the valuation compressed and had an overweight rating for the stock with a price target of $190.

This feat is impressive, and it has issued more than 10 billion tokens.

It also has a modest dividend yield of 0.75%.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 29% YTD, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is trading for $842 and has gained 64% in the last five years. The stock is steadily rallying upwards, with a dividend yield of 0.55%. While the yield is not very impressive, the stock\u2019s upward rally is worth enjoying. I\u2019d recommended the stock when it was trading at $743.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported a 9.1% YOY jump in revenue and a 20.7% YOY rise in its e-commerce sales. With growing revenue and profit, Costco has set a strong momentum for the second half of 2024.\n\nOne of the most reliable stocks, Costco is a high-quality business that benefits from consumer loyalty. It reported a 6.6% rise in same-store sales even in an inflationary period. Its membership model, with 74.5 million member households, ensures steady annual fee income. The company has not increased membership prices since 2017, which has worked in its favor.\n\nCostco enjoys a competitive advantage in the industry, and its stock has outperformed the market for years. The company has ample scope for expansion and could benefit as consumer spending improves. With a strong presence across the United States, Costco is ready to expand across Asia and Europe and aims to open 31 new locations by the end of the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you\u2019re retiring, retired, or just thinking about retiring, it\u2019s never too late to protect your portfolio with undervalued retirement stocks \u2013 especially those with dividends.\n\nLook at\u00a0PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), for example. Over the last few weeks, the snack and beverage stock gapped from about $182 to a recent low of $169.52. All on news of a food-safety recall with Quaker products, which seems to be a temporary issue. PEP expects recall costs to moderate as the year goes on.\n\nIn the meantime, as we wait for the temporary weakness to subside, we can collect the current PEP yield of about 3.12% at the moment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe can even take advantage of the weakness in undervalued retirement stocks, like\u00a0American States Water (NYSE:AWR), which yields about 2.36% at the moment. With a 70-year history of dividend payouts, it\u2019s still a strong Dividend King that will bounce back as it historically has.\n\nWhile those two are certainly worth buying, here are three other undervalued retirement stocks you may want to buy and hold today.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) A close-up shot of a marijuana growhouse. cannabis trends\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the hottest topics of the year has been cannabis, and more states may approve its use. Over\u00a088% of Americans want to see it legalized. It\u2019s also being rescheduled. Plus, as we near the U.S. election in November, there\u2019s growing speculation we could hear more about the potential for legalization. After all, when 88% of the public says it wants something, you pay attention.\n\nOne of the best ways to profit from the potential is with a real estate investment trust (REIT), such as Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR). The company focuses on acquisition, and management of state-licensed cannabis operators.\u00a0It owns 108 properties across 19 states with 8.9 million rentable square feet.\n\nBetter, IIPR carries a current yield of 6.65%. So, not only can we collect that yield, we can make money from appreciation as the cannabis story heats up.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) Dark server room that's illuminated by blue lights and features numerous rows of server units\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAt just $147.31,\u00a0Digital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) still has massive upside potential.\n\nAll thanks to demand for its data centers, driven by unstoppable demand for artificial intelligence (AI). Plus, its yield of 3.31% is tough to overlook, too. In May, DLR declared a quarterly dividend of $1.22, payable June 28 to shareholders of record as of June 14.\n\nAlso remember,\u00a0according to Goldman Sachs, data center demand is expected to rise at a 15% CAGR until 2030.\u00a0Jones Lang LaSalle CEO, Christian Ulbrich, says there\u2019s soaring demand for data centers with AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nRBC Capital analysts raised its price target on Digital Realty to $160 from $144, rating the shares as outperform.Deutsche Bank also raised its price target to $145 from $143, with a hold rating. Even Evercore ISI adjusted its target on Digital Realty to $160 from $154, with an outperform rating.\n\nEvercore ISI added that, \u201cQ1 marked \u2018a solid start to the year\u2019 for data center REITs as bookings performance and pricing are reflective of strong fundamentals amid AI tailwinds driving higher demand, while supply remains tight,\u201d as quoted by TheFly.com.\n\nSTAG Industrial (STAG) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nNext up is\u00a0STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG), which yields 4.26%.\n\nIt also just declared a monthly dividend of $0.1233, payable June 17 to shareholders of record as of May 31. It\u2019s also payable on July 15 to shareholders of record as of June 28.\n\nThe REIT \u2013 which leases industrial properties, such as warehouses and distribution centers to e-commerce companies \u2013 is also benefiting from consumers shifting to online shopping.\n\n\u201cCurrent projections estimate that by 2025, online shopping could represent one-quarter of all retail transactions,\u201d\u00a0says MidMichiganNow.com. \u201cThis shift is primarily driven by the convenience of shopping from home, which offers consumers the ability to browse and purchase without the need to travel, endure potential crowds, or face the disappointment of out-of-stock items.\u201d As long as that trend continues, REITs like STAG should benefit.\n\nIn addition, the REIT just posted funds from operations of 59 cents, which beat estimates by a penny. Revenue of $187.54 million, up 8.1% year over year, beating expectations by $3.23 million. Net operating income of $145.5 million jumped nearly 10% year over year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "With temperatures on the rise, investors are looking into the next beverage stocks to buy before they bubble up. Scientists expect 2024 to be the hottest year on record, with at least a 99% likelihood of it making it to the top two warmest-ever summers on record. Higher temperatures from climate change are expected to push demand for refreshing beverages up in the coming months.\r\n\r\nThe expected scorching weather points to strong growth in beverage consumption, with an estimated increase of over 10% this year. Most of the gains are projected to come from non-alcoholic preferences. Price-conscious consumers continue to seek value despite the expected increase in demand. Online retailers are well-positioned to offer convenience and competitive pricing to this segment. Additionally, surveys show a focus on health and wellness, highlighting low-sugar and immunity-boosting products as top preferences.\r\n\r\nGiven these trends, certain beverage stocks may rise as summer approaches. The following three beverage stocks to buy show promise for gains in the hot months ahead.\n\nPrimo Water (PRMW) A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.\n\nSource: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.com\n\nPrimo Water (NYSE:PRMW), a leading provider of water solutions in North America and Europe, is one of the beverage stocks to buy for refreshing gains. The company sells bottled water, water filtration systems and other water-centered products. The PWMW stock price has risen over 50% year-to-date (YTD).\r\n\r\nThe company has reported strong earnings for the first quarter under its new CEO, Robbert Rietbroek, a former PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) executive. It posted earnings growth and raised full-year guidance and quarterly free cash flow (CFC) from continuing operations. EBITDA increased by 24% and revenue by 9.6% in Q1 2024, resulting in a gross margin of 64.4%.\r\n\r\nPrimo\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.6x is above the beverage industry average of 25x. However, the company\u2019s performance over the past several quarters suggests continued growth in an industry characterized by a defensive nature.\n\nEmbotelladora Andina (AKO-B) Food Trends\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/rsi1986\n\nEmbotelladora Andina (NYSE:AKO-B), based in Santiago, Chile, is another beverage stock worth considering. As South America\u2019s largest bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products, it offers stability as a consumer staple as well as emerging market growth potential. Beyond main Coca-Cola brands, the company also markets a variety of sports drinks, fruit juices and mineral waters and licenses bottling services.\r\n\r\nEmbotelladora Andina stands out for its profitability. In the last quarter, revenue increased 14.6% to CLP 804.6 billion, driven primarily by revenue growth in Brazil (44.45%) and Paraguay (37.9%). The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, well above the industry average of 10.6%. Notably, Ebotelladora increased net income by 63.4% to CLP 70.8 billion despite lower sales volume year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo far this year, the AKO-B share price has risen largely in line with the overall market, shy of a 30% gain. That suggests the company\u2019s upside may be underappreciated, as it trades at a lower PE ratio of 13.4x while offering twice the industry\u2019s dividend yield at 4.65%.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) is the last pick of beverage stocks to buy. As an established company in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, it is the only company on this list selling coffee. Keurig\u2019s CEO plans to revitalize the coffee business with its new brewing system, K-Rounds, plant-based coating pods for environmentally friendly coffee lovers. The company also owns other brands suited for health-conscious consumers, such as Snapple and Core Hydration.\n\nThe company\u2019s increased gross profit during the last quarter supports its strong financial position. Management said they expect mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit adjusted EPS growth for the full year, driven by momentum in the U.S. and international businesses. The company plans to expand in Q3 in Arizona by acquiring Kalil Bottling.\r\n\r\nThe KDP stock trades at a low P/E ratio of 22.3x, slightly below industry averages, and offers a dividend yield of 2.5%. After bottoming in mid-March, the KDP share price has risen steadily and may return to its prior levels when its P/E ratio was in the 30s in recent years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The New Norm: 7 Stocks to Buy for the Possibility of Permanent Inflation",
        "content": "We may have to deal with the unfortunate paradigm that these high prices may be permanent and if so, it\u2019s best to start strategizing for inflation stocks to buy. You see, the Federal Reserve might not be able to work its magic anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been going back and forth on in my mind. However, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re already at the level of inflation we would have seen if the Covid-19 crisis had not happened. I made the argument recently that when you consider the recent pre-pandemic growth rate of the M2 money stock, we were on a trajectory to reach the same level of \u201cmoney printing\u201d that we have right now.\n\nIn other words, the Fed may have already driven the money stock down to the lowest level possible without damaging the economy. So, why does it feel like we\u2019re behind the curve? Here\u2019s the thing: some folks have done really well post-pandemic and many others have not.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDriving prices down from here may cause deflation, which is also what the Fed doesn\u2019t want to see. Given this reality, we may have permanent inflation. And that brings us to inflation stocks to buy.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) A photo of bottles of Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble (PG) on a store shelf.\n\nSource: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com\n\nAs a consumer packaged goods manufacturer, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) represents an ideal play for inflation stocks to buy. Because it provides the goods that we use every day, P&G enjoys permanent relevance. I have also made the argument for InvestorPlace that the company benefits from generational loyalty. People may use the brands that they grew up with as kids.\n\nInterestingly enough, ChatGPT gave a similar argument. It stated that P&G is a company that features \u201cstrong brand loyalty and pricing power.\u201d It\u2019s hard to disagree. As one of the biggest companies in the world, chances are, you\u2019ve used several of its brands. And again, because we need the essentials like toilet paper, the underlying business is predictable.\n\nAnalysts see the same thing. For fiscal 2024, they\u2019re looking at earnings per share of $6.55, which is up 11% from last year\u2019s print of $5.90. Also, revenue may land at $84.37 billion, up 2.9% from 2023\u2019s tally of $82.01 billion. Combine these stats with a decent forward yield of 2.41% and you have a solid case for inflation stocks to buy.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBig-box retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) arguably makes intuitive sense as one of the inflation stocks to buy. First, as a one-stop shop, it offers practically everything for everyone. That\u2019s more significant than you might initially realize. In a competitive environment, you need to book deals whenever and wherever possible. So, if a customer buys something at Walmart on a whim, they\u2019re not buying it anywhere else.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, Walmart is free for all shoppers. Without a membership required, you\u2019re just going to get more volume. As people get laid off from their high-paying tech jobs, the retailer could enjoy a cynical boost because of its accessibility. Over the trailing 12 months (TTM), the company posted net income of $18.94 billion, or EPS of $2.33. Sales during the period landed at $657.33 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts believe that EPS could rise almost 20% to hit $2.43. On the top line, sales may rise 13.7% to land at $676.55 billion. That aligns with an okay 1.25% forward yield, making it one of the reliable inflation stocks to buy.\n\nMurphy USA (MUSA) Murphy USA gas station and convenience store located on an out parcel of a Walmart Supercenter\n\nSource: Lawrence Glass / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of Walmart, we\u2019ve got to talk about Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA). Based in El Dorado, Arkansas, Murphy USA operates a chain of retail gas stations. Primarily, these stores are located in proximity to Walmart retailers. That\u2019s significant because people are also hurting in the downstream energy department. Let\u2019s be real \u2013 if you\u2019re shopping regularly at Walmart, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not driving an electric vehicle.\n\nI\u2019m not casting any aspersions. While Walmart has attracted a larger number of individuals making six figures, the company tends to attract the core middle-income crowd. Since EVs are higher priced than their combustion-powered counterparts at the moment, Walmart shoppers likely drive combustion-based vehicles. That\u2019s opportunistic for Murphy USA but that\u2019s also what makes MUSA one of the inflation stocks to buy.\n\nI need to warn you that analysts don\u2019t share the same love that I have for MUSA. Instead, they pensively view shares as a consensus hold. For example, the average revenue target for fiscal 2024 is $21.64 billion, up only half a percent. Still, the cynical factor could swing the needle for MUSA.\n\nDuke Energy (DUK) The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn my opinion, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) makes an easy case for inflation stocks to buy. As a power and natural gas holding firm, Duke is an essential part of life for the regions that it covers. Basically, utility firms benefit from a concept known as natural monopolies. These enterprises are entrenched. While other companies can offer competition, they don\u2019t bother due to regulatory challenges and other obstacles.\n\nIt\u2019s terribly cynical when you think about it because practically speaking, Duke\u2019s customers must pay up. Of course, people can choose to go off-grid but that invites its own set of challenges. Another factor that helps move the needle for DUK stock is the underlying forward dividend yield. At 3.92%, it definitely helps pad the overall narrative.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Duke posted net income of $4.31 billion, translating to EPS of $5.59. Revenue reached $29 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are hoping to see EPS of $5.97, up 7.4% from last year\u2019s print of $5.56. Also, sales could bump up 3.3% to reach $30.02 billion. It\u2019s a great example of inflation stocks to buy.\n\nPublic Storage (PSA) a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildings\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Glendale, California, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) is structured as a real estate investment trust or REIT. Per its corporate profile, Public Storage represents the largest brand of self-storage services in the U.S. That just about might make PSA one of the most compelling inflation stocks to buy. With people looking to downsize, this REIT should see increased demand.\n\nFurther, I\u2019m not just referring to baby boomers looking for a smaller place to live while safekeeping their heirlooms. I mean, that is a powerful catalyst for PSA, no doubt. However, there\u2019s another angle to consider. With younger folks finding it difficult to buy a home, they may be forced to rent in increasingly pricey apartment complexes. They can choose to downsize while doing the same thing: keeping big items in storage.\n\nDuring the TTM period, net income landed at $1.94 billion, translating to EPS of $11.02. Revenue in the period reached $4.61 billion. For fiscal 2024, the high-side EPS target calls for $11.57. On the revenue front, the blue-sky forecast is aiming for $4.83 billion.\n\nWheaton Precious Metals (WPM) Wheaton Precious Metals logo close-up on website page. WPM stock.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nPerhaps no story about inflation stocks to buy is complete without mentioning gold or gold-related investments. For that, market participants may want to consider Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM). Wheaton specializes in the metals streaming business model. This involves providing mining firms with upfront cash in exchange for either all or part of the actual commodities extracted.\n\nFor Wheaton, one of the main benefits is better pricing predictability. Again, the contract and the terms are upfront so there are fewer surprises. That also theoretically helps in the volatility department. Gold miners tend to be wild and WPM helps cut some of the volatility down. Further, if prices continue to rise, WPM should generally rise with them.\n\nIn the TTM period, Wheaton\u2019s net income landed at $590.29 million, translating to EPS of $1.30. Revenue during this time reached $1.1 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are projecting EPS to reach $1.33, up 12.7% from last year. On the top line, sales could rise 21.8% to hit $1.24 billion. It\u2019s easily one of the inflation stocks to buy or at least to put on your radar.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nA soft drink giant, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) really needs no introduction. It may not be quite as popular as its main rival but it\u2019s a global powerhouse brand. As stated earlier, during a challenging economic environment, it\u2019s important for companies to grab sales whenever they can. If brand loyalty or recognition is the catalyst that drives sales to Pepsi, so be it.\n\nAnother element that could figure into Pepsi\u2019s rise as one of the inflation stocks to buy is demand for caffeine. The global coffee market could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% to 2030. On the other hand, the global energy drink market could expand at a CAGR of 8.3%. Apparently, the preference for consuming caffeine through soft drinks is booming. That should help PEP stock.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Pepsi posted net income of $9.18 billion or EPS of $6.64. Revenue reached $91.88 billion. For fiscal 2024, analysts are targeting EPS of $8.17 on revenue of $94.48 billion. These figures represent a sizable improvement from last year\u2019s EPS of $7.07 on sales of $84.9 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Uncertainty Over Rate Cuts Continue",
        "content": "Inflation eased marginally in April but the crisis is far from over as the Federal Reserve is in a wait-and-watch mode as far as the planned rate cuts are concerned. This has led to volatility returning to Wall Street.\n\nLast week, all three major indexes snapped their winning streak. The Dow, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500\u2019s five-week rally came to a halt, with the indexes ending the week 0.5% and 1.1% lower, respectively. The Dow finished 0.9% lower to record its second straight week of losses.\n\nIn April, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 3.4% from the previous year and increased by 0.3% from the previous month, slightly below the expected 0.4% rise.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, saw a 0.3% monthly increase in April, in line with expectations and unchanged from March.\n\nCore PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose by 0.2% in April, which was lower than March's 0.3% increase and the expected repeat increase.\n\nYear over year, PCE increased by 2.7% in April, consistent with March's growth and analysts\u2019 expectations. Core PCE rose by 2.8% year over year, matching March's jump and in line with expectations.\n\nHowever, inflation remains sharply above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, which has raised uncertainty over future rate cuts.\n\nThe Fed had indicated multiple rate cuts in 2024 but that isn\u2019t likely to happen. The Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unaltered in the range of 5.25-5.50% but market participants believe the first rate cut isn\u2019t likely to happen before September, followed by another cut by December.\n\nMoreover, manufacturing activity continues to slow. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7% in May, recording its 18th decline in the past 19 months.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this situation, it would be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples such as Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, California Water Service Group CWT, Portland General Electric Company POR, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP and Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAlso, these belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). Hence, the recommended approach is to invest in low-beta stocks with a high-dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank.\n\nAtmos Energy Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. ATO serves nearly 3.4 million customers in more than 1,400 communities in eight states, from the Blue Ridge Mountains in the East to the Rocky Mountains in the West. Atmos Energyoperates more than 72,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines as well as 5,700 miles of interstate pipelines.\n\nStory continues\n\nAtmos Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 9.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. ATO presently has a Zacks Rank #2. Atmos Energy has a beta of 0.67 and a current dividend yield of 2.78%.\n\nCalifornia Water Service Group is one of the largest investor-owned water utilities in the United States. CWT has six subsidiaries \u2014 California Water Service, Washington Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Hawaii Water Service Company, CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility Services.\n\nCalifornia Water Service Group has an expected earnings growth rate of 246.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 40% over the last 60 days. CWT currently carries a Zacks Rank #1. California Water Service Group has a beta of 0.48 and a current dividend yield of 2.24%.\n\nPortland General Electric Company is a vertically integrated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in Oregon. POR has more than a century of experience in power delivery. Portland General Electric Company generates power from a diverse mix of resources, including hydropower, coal and natural gas.\n\nPortland General Electric Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 60 days. POR presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Portland General Electric Company has a beta of 0.58 and a current dividend yield of 4.30%.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. is one of the leading global food and beverage companies. PEP\u2019s complementary brands/businesses include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods. PepsiCo serves customers in more than 200 countries and territories.\n\nPepsiCo has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days. PEP currently has a Zacks Rank #2. PepsiCo has a beta of 0.52 and a current dividend yield of 2.91%.\n\nKimberly-Clark Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world. KMB sells its products to supermarkets; mass merchandisers; drugstores; warehouse clubs; variety and department stores; retail outlets; manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, and health care establishments; and high-volume public facilities.\n\nKimberly-Clark Corporation has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.9% for the current year.

        "content": "Dividends are a main reason investors buy stocks. Equally important, dividends are often the reason investors hold onto a stock. Companies have accepted these facts. So, many publicly traded companies use their dividend payments to keep shareholders content. And it makes them eager to maintain a position in their stock.\n\nCertain companies make raising their dividend payout to shareholders a priority. Yet, others even issue special one-time dividends when times are particularly good and they are sitting on piles of excess cash. Blue-chip companies, which are often mature and slow growing, tend to make raising their dividend and rewarding shareholders a focus.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three high dividend-yielding companies that are primed to delight their shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimply stated, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one of the best dividend stocks around.\n\nEarlier this year, the soft drink maker raised its quarterly dividend payment to shareholders by 5.4%. Coca-Cola now pays its stockholders a quarterly dividend of 48.5 cents per share, up from 46 cents previously. The dividend yield on KO stock is now 3.03% based on the current share price. Furthermore, Coca-Cola has increased its dividend payment for 62 consecutive years.\n\nAlso, the consistent annual increases place Coke in a select group of companies known as \u201cdividend kings,\u201d which are publicly traded companies that have grown their dividend payments for 50 consecutive years or longer. Interestingly, Coca-Cola\u2019s arch rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) recently joined the dividend king club, having raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years. PepsiCo\u2019s dividend yield currently stands at 3.12%. KO stock has risen 7% so far this year.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWorld\u2019s largest bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) continues to reward its shareholders. In March of this year, the lender raised its quarterly dividend payment for the second time in six months as it reported record profits. JPMorgan Chase hiked its dividend by 9.50% to $1.15 a share. Previously, the bank paid a dividend of $1.05 per share. JPM stock now has a dividend yield of 2.31%.\n\nAlso, the latest dividend increase was announced after JPMorgan reported a record profit of $49.50 billion for all of 2023. It was the second time in less than a year that the company raised its dividend payout to stockholders. The company previously adjusted its dividend in October 2023, taking it to $1.05 a share from $1. News of the record profit and dividend increase come as JPM stock has risen 43% in the last 12 months.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast autumn, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) lifted its quarterly dividend payment by 10%.\n\nStarting in December, the quick service restaurant chain began paying its stockholders a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share, up from $1.52 previously. The higher payment gives McDonald\u2019s a dividend yield of 2.54% based on the share price. Over the past decade, the Golden Arches has more than doubled its annual dividend payment, taking it to $6.68 a share per year from $3.08.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s paid its first dividend to shareholders in 1976 and has increased it every year since. Notably, the company is known as a \u201cdividend aristocrat,\u201d which is a publicly traded concern that has raised its dividend payout for 25 consecutive years or longer. Therefore, McDonald\u2019s is on the cusp of becoming a dividend king if it continues raising its dividend for three more years. MCD stock has declined 12% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When most people hear the term \u201cbeverage stocks,\u201d they probably picture rather ancient, slow-growing staples like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NYSE:PEP). But beverage companies can actually expand extremely quickly.\n\nEnergy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), soared from $3.40 in February 2010 to $46.50 in May 2021 while Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) jumped from $32.65 in September 2020 to $70.55 in July 2023. Meanwhile, even Warren Buffett is a believer in beverage stocks, as shown by his significant, longtime stake in Coca-Cola. In fact, the Oracle owns 400 million shares of the soda maker and has owned the company\u2019s stock since way back in 1988.\n\nHere are three beverage stocks that are well-positioned to produce big returns for investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nVita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) beverages are fairly healthy as they are based on coconut water. According to Healthline, coconut water is \u201cnaturally sweet and hydrating,\u201d while it is also \u201cloaded with several important nutrients, including minerals that many people don\u2019t get enough of.\u201d And unlike coconut milk, coconut water contains very little fat. Additionally, several studies show the beverage could be more efficient than water when it comes to helping people recover from exercise sessions. Vita Coco heavily utilizes the latter aspect of the liquid in its marketing campaigns.\n\nThose efforts are bearing some fruit (no pun intended) as the company\u2019s top line jumped to $493.6 million last quarter last year from $427.8 million in 2022. Moreover, its operating income soared over five times to $56.9 million in 2023 from $10.4 million in 2022. Meanwhile, analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to advance to 94 cents this year from 79 cents in 2023.\n\nLarge investors also appear to be warming up to the name as COCO stock climbed 22% from Apr. 22 to Jun. 4.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI view Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) as having found a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of sorts because its beverages are healthy, don\u2019t use artificial sweeteners, have very few calories, taste rather good and provide a tremendous amount of energy via caffeine.\n\nIts products include large amounts of important vitamins. For example, its Live Fit offerings have 90% of the FDA\u2019s Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for Vitamin C, 130% ofor Riboflavin, and 120% for B6.\n\nLast quarter the company\u2019s revenue jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier. That growth enabled its top line to reach $355.7 million. Further, its earnings per share more than doubled year-over-year to 27 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nLately, the Street has shunned its shares, largely because its growth has slowed slightly, according to Nielsen. But retail demand for the company\u2019s product is increasing and the placement of its beverages is improving. Also importantly, Celsius is in the process of expanding to multiple, significant overseas markets.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) sign on the front of a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAccording to Beverage Digest, Dr Pepper last year overtook Pepsi to become America\u2019s second favorite soft drink. Specifically, Dr Pepper and Pepsi both commanded 8.3% of the soft drink market in 2023, with Dr Pepper holding a slight edge. Buffett\u2019s Coca Cola remained way ahead of both of the other two firms with a 19.2% share.\n\nThe news is certainly positive for Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) which, of course, manufactures and markets Dr Pepper. The data suggests the company is doing a very good job of marketing its soda. What\u2019s more, the news itself has given the company a great deal of free publicity.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on CNBC\u2019s Halftime Report on Jun. 4, Jenny\u00a0Van Leeuwen Harrington, the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, said the new weight loss drugs could cause consumers to cut back on Keurig Dr Pepper\u2019s Keurig pods. But I believe that the opposite could very well be true. That\u2019s because as consumers drink fewer sugary drinks that give them energy, they could turn more to low-calorie coffees to obtain energy instead.\n\nAlthough consumers on the weight loss drug are likely to drink less regular Dr Pepper, many are likely to switch to Diet Dr Pepper instead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in CELH. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "The Top 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Until 2030",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are popular for a reason. These stocks are supported by companies with solid underlying businesses generating strong cash flow. Top-rated mature companies have histories that span decades, and they\u2019re unlikely to be knocked off course if there is a recession. Plus, reinvesting these dividends could compound your returns over the decades, resulting in massive overall gains.\n\nAs such, I think allocating a good chunk of your portfolio towards such dividend stocks is a good idea. These stocks should provide considerable ballast (and cash) when times are tough, and they\u2019ll continue growing well during the good times. Here are seven dividend stocks to buy and hold until 2030 and beyond.\n\nFlowers Foods (FLO) bakery breads, buns and pastries on a wooden cutting board in a display case\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/ampersandphoto\n\nFlowers Foods (NYSE:FLO) produces and markets packaged bakery foods in the United States. Despite the challenging consumer environment, the company\u2019s solid first-quarter results reflect the increasing effectiveness of its portfolio strategy driven by investments in marketing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI believe Flowers Foods is one of the most stable and consistent stocks over the past two decades. While FLO stock has dipped slightly recently (like most retail stocks), the company grew branded retail volumes for the first time since 2020, with Dave\u2019s Killer Bread leading the way with its second consecutive quarter of 10% unit growth.\n\nManagement is maintaining its full-year outlook, which incorporates continued volume improvement. Although economic uncertainty could impact consumer behavior, Flowers Foods is executing well on its portfolio strategy. The stock\u2019s attractive 4.15% dividend yield and 22-year streak of consecutive hikes make it a compelling option for income-focused investors. I remain confident in Flowers Foods\u2019 growth potential and believe it is a solid dividend stock to buy and hold until 2030. FLO dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a global food and beverage powerhouse. This earnings season, I\u2019m even more confident that PEP stock belongs in any long-term dividend growth portfolio. That\u2019s partly due to the fact Pepsi outperformed both earnings and revenue estimates in Q1.\n\nThe company\u2019s international business is firing on all cylinders, already at $36 billion in revenue, and growing at an impressive high single-digit rate with strong margins. PepsiCo is smartly investing in manufacturing capacity expansions in key growth markets like China, India, Vietnam and Poland to further capitalize on this momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Frito-Lay North America margins were a bit soft this quarter, I\u2019m not concerned. The segment still delivered a 2% revenue growth, which is solid, as volume declined by 2%.\n\nWith a current 3.17% dividend yield and an incredible 53-year streak of consecutive payout increases, PepsiCo is a quintessential dividend king worth owning for the long-term. I recommend buying this dip and holding PEP stock through thick and thin. PEP dividend stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nNorthwest Natural (NWN) a gas pipe with the sun going down in the background, natural\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNorthwest Natural Holding (NYSE:NWN) distributes natural gas to customers in the Pacific Northwest. The stock has taken a beating over the past few years, but I believe this beaten-down dividend payer is worth a closer look for income investors with a long-term investing horizon.\n\nIn Q1, NWN reported earnings per share of $1.69, missing estimates by 10 cents, on revenue of $433.5 million, a 6.26% year-over-year decline. Despite the earnings miss and shrinking top line, the company maintained their full-year guidance. Additionally, NWN\u2019s customer base grew 1.7% over the last 12 months, and the company delivered record volumes during a severe winter storm in January, highlighting the essential nature of natural gas.\n\nWhile the Pacific Northwest faces some demographic headwinds, I believe NWN is well-positioned to weather the storm and reward patient investors. LNG prices have also rebounded significantly from recent lows.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think the Pacific Northwest will see its population shrink too much in the coming years. And hotter summers could convince a lot of people to stay or move north. The dividend yield here comes in at 5.2%. NWN dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHercules Capital (HTGC) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nHercules Capital (NYSE:HTGC) is a business development company that provides debt and equity financing to venture capital and private equity-backed companies. I believe this company is well-positioned to deliver strong returns and income for long-term investors. In Q1 2024, Hercules originated a record $956 million in gross debt and equity commitments and funded an impressive $605.2 million. The company generated $121.6 million in total investment income, up nearly 16% year-over-year, and $79.2 million in net investment income, up almost 21%. This allowed Hercules to comfortably cover its 40 cents per share base distribution by 125% despite conservative leverage.\n\nWhile some may view business development companies as risky, especially in a potential recession, I think Hercules deserves more credit. The stock has already climbed 34% over the past year, and investors can still lock in a juicy 8.06% dividend yield. Even if a recession comes, the stock should recover fast, as it has done so many times in the past. HTGC dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) Business marijuana leaves cannabis stocks success market price green arrow up profit growth charts graph money display screen up industry trend grow higher quickly / Commercial cannabis medicine money\n\nSource: Bigc Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) is a cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT). In my view, IIPR is a compelling dividend stock to buy and hold until 2030 for investors willing to take some risk.\n\nThe company reported Q1 2024 revenue of $75.45 million, down a modest 0.81% year-over-year, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $2.21. While growth has moderated, IIPR\u2019s portfolio remains highly stable, with most tenants paying rent on time.\n\nManagement also executed new leases at four properties totaling $69 million and completed construction on three fully leased properties spanning 732,000 square feet in the first four months of 2024 alone. This momentum should drive future cash flow growth to support IIPR\u2019s attractive 6.7% dividend yield. IIPR dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe IIPR\u2019s long-term bull case is underpinned by the high likelihood of U.S. cannabis legalization by 2030, which could significantly expand the company\u2019s growth runway. Even without federal legalization, sales could reach $71 billion by then.\n\nSempra (SRE) image of a hand holding a bright light bulb outdoors with trees in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) is an energy infrastructure company serving nearly 40 million customers. While the stock has only risen 14% over the past five years, I believe Sempra remains a sturdy long-term investment.\n\nIn Q1, Sempra missed revenue estimates considerably, with sales plunging 44.5% year-over-year to $3.64 billion. However, this was primarily due to a pass-through of lower natural gas costs, which fell from $2.7 billion to $554 million. These costs have little profit impact as the savings flow directly to customers.\n\nLooking forward, Sempra can benefit from the current energy infrastructure super-cycle. With strong demand drivers like electrification, AI, and data centers, Sempra is poised to capitalize on grid investments in California and Texas. Meanwhile, its LNG export projects should thrive as Europe shifts away from Russia.\n\nWith 21 consecutive years of dividend hikes and a 3.23% yield, Sempra is exactly the type of resilient dividend grower I want to buy and hold until 2030, if not longer. The recent revenue miss has no impact on my confidence. SRE dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RY) Royal Bank of Canada (RY stock) sign in Toronto's financial district\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY) is Canada\u2019s largest bank by market capitalization. I believe RBC\u2019s strong Q2 results underscore why this is a solid holding for any dividend portfolio. The bank reported net income of $4 billion, with its return on equity (ROE) increasing to an impressive 14.5%. Revenue grew robustly across diversified business lines, from capital markets to Canadian banking.\n\nRBC\u2019s increasing scale advantages and cost discipline drove strong adjusted operating leverage of 4.5%. The bank\u2019s balance sheet remains rock-solid, with a CET1 ratio of 12.8%, even after closing the HSBC Canada acquisition. As Canada\u2019s most influential bank, RBC is not only \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d but also exceptionally well-positioned to grow alongside the country\u2019s booming population.\n\nWith the stock yielding a healthy 3.84% and the dividend being hiked another 3% this quarter, I\u2019m confident RY stock will continue to be a cash cow for shareholders. RY dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nFor sleep-well-at-night dividend income and exposure to Canada\u2019s resilient economy, it\u2019s tough to beat RBC.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The J. M. Smucker Company SJM is likely to register top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Jun 6. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.25 billion, which suggests an increase of 0.5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for quarterly earnings has decreased by 1 cent in the past 30 days to $2.32 per share. This indicates a decline of 12.1% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. SJM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nThe J. M. Smucker has been benefiting from the sustained demand across brands and categories. The company has been progressing well with core priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, reshaping its portfolio, streamlining the cost structure and unleashing its organization to win. Strength in such strategies has been helping the company improve in-store fundamentals and stock performance for the brands. \u00a0\r\n\r\nThe J. M. Smucker has also been experiencing gains from positive net price realization, which has been working well for its comparable sales. Fourth-quarter comparable sales are expected to increase in the mid-single digits.\n\nThe J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nThe J. M. Smucker Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The J. M. Smucker Company Quote\n\nHowever, overall net sales are likely to reflect the impacts of recent divestitures. The company divested the Canadian condiments business in January 2024 and Sahale Snacks in November 2023. That said, the acquisition of the premier snacking company, Hostess Brands (November 2023), is likely to have positively contributed to net sales.\r\n\r\nThe J. M. Smucker has been incurring high selling, distribution and administrative (SD&A) costs.\u00a0 Management expects a fourth-quarter adjusted EPS decline in a mid-teens percentage, mainly due to pre-production expenses of nearly $20 million associated with the new Uncrustables facility, along with additional marketing investments.\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for The J. M. Smucker this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.\r\n\r\nThe J. M. Smucker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, and it has an Earnings ESP of +0.44%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nOther Stocks With the Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some more companies worth considering, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo, Inc. PEP currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register a top-and-bottom-line increase when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $22.7 billion, which implies growth of 1.6% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo\u2019s quarterly earnings of $2.16 suggests an increase of 3.4% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s levels. PEP has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.1%, on average.\r\n\r\nConstellation Brands STZ currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings per share is pegged at $3.49, which suggests 19.9% growth year over year.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Constellation Brands\u2019 quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion, which indicates growth of 6.8% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. STZ has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mills GIS currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.56% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to register a decrease in the top line when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $4.88 billion, which implies a decline of 2.9% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills\u2019 quarterly earnings per share of 99 cents suggests an 11.6% drop from the year-ago quarter.

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) closed the latest trading day at $173.89, indicating a +1.55% change from the previous session's end. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.15% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.36%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.17%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the food and beverage company had lost 2.61% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 0.37%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.2%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on July 11, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.16, up 3.35% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $22.68 billion, up 1.59% from the year-ago period.\n\nPEP's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.16 per share and revenue of $94.53 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +7.09% and +3.35%, respectively.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Right now, PepsiCo possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note PepsiCo's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 20.98. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 18.72 for its industry.\n\nAlso, we should mention that PEP has a PEG ratio of 2.79. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Beverages - Soft drinks industry stood at 2.79 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 92, putting it in the top 37% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Retail stocks are never seen as compounders that can provide outsized returns. Of course, that narrative has changed this year with the performance of Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF). Over the past year, ANF has returned more than 440%.\n\nOf course, not all retail stocks will provide you with these returns. But just like any other sector, choosing winners can provide incredible growth for your portfolio. These three retail stocks offer very different products and services to consumers. What do they have in common? Their stocks are steadily moving higher and to the right on their charts. Check out these three retail stocks to buy that could be the next Abercrombie and Fitch.\n\nCelsius (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is an American energy drink maker looking to expand into international markets. Wall Street thinks highly of the stock, as analysts have a one-year average price target of $94.23 and a street-high target of $110, which indicates the potential for a 40% upside from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhy has Celsius done so well? It has a variety of different products that target different audiences. For the most part, the consensus is that Celsius beverages taste better than most other energy drinks. Its distribution partnership with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has allowed it to sell at major retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Celsius is eyeing an expansion into Europe and other international markets over the next couple of years.\n\nStocks with impressive growth tend to trade at higher valuations. The company has a five-year revenue CAGR of 91% and a ten-year CAGR of 71%. Its gross margin of 50% is easily higher than the industry average of 38%, showing how efficiently Celsius runs. Shares trade at 72x forward earnings but just 13x sales. These are high for a retail stock, but the growth rates of Celsius speak louder than those of its multiples.\n\nOn Holdings (ONON) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn Holdings (NASDAQ:ONON) is a Swiss running shoes and apparel maker founded by former Swiss Ironman Champion Olivier Bernhard. Of the 21 analyst ratings it received in May, 16 were a Buy or Strong Buy. The street-high analyst price target is $55.18, more than 30% higher than the current price.\n\nOn is looking to disrupt the industry with its CloudTec technology, which has garnered a strong following of running enthusiasts and will be used by multiple athletes in the upcoming Paris Summer Olympic Games. On is also taking a chunk of the tennis apparel market with sponsor athletes like Roger Federer and world number one Iga Swiatek.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Celsius, On commands a high price multiple due to its revenue growth and strong gross margin. On\u2019s gross margin of 60% is double the industry average of 30.1%, which also shows the pricing power that the company has for its products. Shares of ONON trade at 13x sales and 45x forward earnings after rising by nearly 60% in 2024. With a strong presence at the Olympic Games, On can capture an even larger market share.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a membership-based retail chain that follows the big-box wholesale model. As of June 2024, Costco is the 24th-largest company in the world by market capitalization. Analysts remain bullish on the stock even after returning 60% over the past year. It has a one-year price target range of $650 to $940, which implies the potential for about 15% more upside.\n\nThe most important part of Costco\u2019s business is its memberships. As of 2023, Costco had more than 130 million active members worldwide. Why is this important? In 2024, Costco announced it was raising the price of memberships, cracking down on shared memberships, and requiring a membership to purchase food from its food court. This pricing power and recurring revenue show why Costco\u2019s membership is so vital to the company\u2019s success.\n\nAlthough shares are over $800 now, they trade at just 1.4x sales and 46.5x forward earnings. For a business this size, to grow net income at a ten-year CAGR of 14% is impressive and part of the reason you are paying a high multiple for the stock. At its current price, don\u2019t rule out an imminent stock split and potentially even an addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

UNFI has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 179.3%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nUnited Natural has been witnessing a challenging industry backdrop over the past few quarters. Consumers are buying less to manage their budgets and shifting away from traditional grocery stores, possibly seeking more affordable options like discount stores, bulk buys or online shopping. On its last earnings call, management highlighted that it anticipates a more prolonged recovery for volume. These factors raise concerns for the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nHowever, United Natural\u2019s focus on its transformation journey, which involves several strategic elements, bodes well. As part of this process, the company is rapidly implementing near-term value-creation initiatives that are expected to contribute significantly to its operating efficiencies.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.34 billion, which suggests an increase of about 5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for quarterly earnings has decreased by 1 cent in the past 30 days to 70 cents per share. However, this indicates growth of 2.9% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. CPB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.7%, on average.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nCampbell Soup\u2019s consistent execution has been noteworthy, with robust and sustained performance across the supply chain, successful innovations, effective marketing programs and recent share trend improvements. The ongoing momentum, coupled with the acquisition of Sovos Brands (concluded in Mar 2024), positions Campbell Soup well for the quarter under review.\r\n\r\nOn its first-quarter earnings call, management stated that it had optimized its strategies and plans, focusing on three key areas. These areas include ensuring product affordability and maintaining competitive pricing within the boundaries of margin goals, sustaining marketing and innovation initiatives and adhering to a disciplined and balanced spending approach with a focus on high return on investment and impactful plans. A focus on these strategies is likely to have aided.\n\nCampbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nCampbell Soup Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Campbell Soup Company Quote\n\nCampbell Soup has been benefiting from its Snacks business. Despite a tough economic landscape, sales in the segment grew in the last reported quarter, fueled by brands like Goldfish, Lance, Kettle Brand and Cape Cod. Management\u2019s DSD transformation initiative is likely to have boosted further growth in the Snacks division. We expect a 2% increase in the Snacks segment\u2019s organic sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\r\n\r\nHowever, Campbell Soup has been navigating a volatile consumer landscape. On its last earnings call, management stated that the company was pacing toward the lower end of the fiscal 2024 net sales view, with expectations to witness a sequential improvement throughout the year. For the third quarter, management expects a flat to low-single-digit increase in organic sales.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, CPB has been undertaking brand-related investments and envisions marketing and selling expenses to range between 9% and 10% as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2024, with more spending anticipated in the third quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Our model suggests a 10.7% increase in adjusted marketing and selling expenses for the third quarter, with the expense rate likely to expand 60 basis points to 9.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Campbell Soup this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nCampbell Soup currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, while it has an Earnings ESP of -0.47%.

        "content": "Five Below, Inc. FIVE is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Jun 5 after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $832.7 million, which suggests an improvement of 14.7% from the prior-year reported figure.\r\n\r\nOver the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share has decreased by a penny to 63 cents. The figure indicates decline of 6% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThis extreme-value retailer for tweens, teens and beyond has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company\u2019s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 3.4%.\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nFive Below's emphasis on offering current and in-demand products, enhancing supply-chain efficiency, bolstering digital infrastructure and expanding physical store presence positions it for success. Known for its diverse product portfolio, Five Below comfortably adapts to evolving consumer preferences. These attributes, coupled with the pricing strategy, enable the company to cater to demographic shoppers and resonate with value-seeking customers.\r\n\r\nWe believe the higher penetration of Five Beyond and the e-commerce business, new customer acquisitions, the sales lift from remodels and conversions and selective merchandise price increases to counter inflation are likely to have favorably impacted the company\u2019s sales. We expect comparable sales to increase 1.2% for the quarter under discussion.\r\n\r\nHowever, the quarter may also reveal challenges, particularly in the form of potential deleverage in SG&A expenses and elevated shrink levels, which could adversely affect margins. We expect SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, to deleverage 80 basis points.\n\nFive Below, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Five Below, Inc.

        "content": "If you are worried about the economy and how the market will move from here,\u00a0it is ideal to invest\u00a0in dividend stocks that pay, no matter the market situation.\u00a0When you have dividend aristocrat stocks in your portfolio, you can ensure consistent payouts for years.\u00a0These\u00a0are companies that\u00a0have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years. They\u00a0have enough liquidity to keep doing the same, in rain or shine.\n\nIt is not easy for companies to achieve the status of dividend aristocrats, and given the market situation, some of the best stocks have dipped due to a market pullback.\u00a0This\u00a0is your chance to scoop up the incredibly stable and highly rewarding dividend stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s explore three dividend stocks to buy in the current market pullback.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nA household name, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a beverage and snacks giant with a global presence. The company is no longer just a beverage maker but owns some of the biggest snack brands\u00a0including\u00a0Frito Lay.\u00a0Trading at $171, PEP stock hasn\u2019t shown much\u00a0of a\u00a0movement since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt was trading at the same level in January and has moved sideways over the past few months. The stock dropped 6% in the past 12 months. Therefore, this pullback is your chance to pounce on the dividend aristocrat. Despite beating expectations in the\u00a0first-quarter results, the stock slipped. The core financials improved year-over-year (YOY), and the company reported an organic growth of 2.7% YOY.\n\nWhile the dividend payout ratio has remained stagnant over the past five years, its dividend yield and the dividends per share have increased. It has a yield of 3.14% and pays a quarterly dividend of $1.36 per share per quarter. The dividend aristocrat has raised dividends for over 60 years and has enough cash flow to keep doing so.\n\nMoreover, the current stock pullback is temporary since its growth story isn\u2019t over yet. The international market is expanding, and PepsiCo enjoys healthy profitability.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nHaving raised dividends for 46 consecutive years, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) can ensure steady passive income,\u00a0no matter the\u00a0market situation.\u00a0Trading at $259, MCD stock has dropped 12% year-to-date (YTD). The stock was trading\u00a0very\u00a0close to $300 at the beginning of the year and has\u00a0dropped\u00a0significantly since then. This pullback\u00a0is a chance for\u00a0smart\u00a0investors to load up on the restaurant stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the business has survived several economic uncertainties and reported\u00a0impressive financials\u00a0despite high inflation.\u00a0It saw a 4.6% revenue jump to $6.17 billion, and the EPS came in at $2.70. The EPS came below expectations due to the change in consumer spending.\u00a0This\u00a0has impacted several companies across the industry but could be temporary.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s enjoys a dividend yield of 2.58% and pays a quarterly dividend of $1.67. If you look at the long-term picture, McDonald\u2019s will continue to thrive and\u00a0will\u00a0not disappoint investors. It has aggressive expansion plans and aims to open nearly\u00a010,000 new restaurants\u00a0globally by 2027, to reach\u00a0a total of\u00a050,000 restaurants.\n\nIt\u2019s successful franchise model\u00a0helps keep the cost of operations\u00a0low while ensuring steady royalty income.\u00a0This\u00a0is one stock that\u00a0will continue to reward\u00a0investors,\u00a0no matter where the market moves from here. MCD is one of the top dividend aristocrat stocks to add to your portfolio.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown 8% YTD, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock is trading at $147 and is moving near the 52-week low\u00a0which\u00a0is your chance to grab this stock. JNJ is a well-known brand globally, and the company thrives on acquisitions and mergers. Recently, it completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical, its push into the cardiovascular space.\n\nAlso, this dividend aristocrat has raised annual dividends for 62 consecutive years,\u00a0which\u00a0is one\u00a0of the longest in the healthcare industry.\u00a0An important\u00a0global player, the company has a massive portfolio of healthcare products and Medtech devices\u00a0which\u00a0ensure\u00a0steady revenue growth.\n\nBesides regularly making money from the popular drugs, it has seen growth in the medical devices segment\u00a0which was up\u00a04% YOY in the\u00a0first quarter.\u00a0Yes, the company has reported lackluster performance in the past few years. But this doesn\u2019t mean you can write it off.\u00a0It is a highly specialized pure-play pharmaceutical company and one of the best dividend stocks to own.\n\nAny pullback in Johnson & Johnson is a chance for you to snag the stock. It will keep rewarding shareholders for years to come and has managed to\u00a0grow,\u00a0despite several economic ups and downs. The company operates in an industry that will\u00a0always\u00a0keep growing, and innovation is the key to its success.

        "content": "The financial media does its best to keep you informed about what\u2019s happening in the market. However, this has the effect of giving significant attention to a handful of leaders or laggards. That creates an opportunity for investors who have the patience to look for must-own overlooked stocks.\n\nOverlooked stocks are not necessarily underperforming the market. In some cases, these stocks simply are slow and steady at a time when investors want to find the newest and brightest shiny object.\n\nHowever, not every shiny object is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). And the more light that starts shining on a high-profile stock, the more likely it is that the stock could move sharply lower on the slightest bit of bad news.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnother common misconception about overlooked stocks is that they come with a cheap price tag. This is also not necessarily true. In fact, sometimes a stock gets overlooked because it seems too expensive for retail investors.\n\nIn the end, must-buy overlooked stocks come down to value more than price. Because value always wins out over time. Here are seven stocks that investors are overlooking now but may shift back towards when market conditions change.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USA\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is up 13.4% in the last 12 months but is down 11% in the last three months. The biopharmaceutical giant is being overlooked for a couple of reasons. First, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 40x, it\u2019s hardly a cheap stock. Second, investors want to see how the company\u2019s revenue and earnings will hold up now that its flagship Humira drug faces biosimilar competition in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nWhen looking at the P/E ratio it\u2019s helpful to note that AbbVie has a forward P/E of around 13x earnings. That\u2019s much more attractive.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Humira question. There\u2019s no doubt that the company is seeing pressure from competitors. In its April earnings report, AbbVie reported a 39% decline in Humira revenue in the United States.\n\nHowever, AbbVie also reported strong growth from two of its newer drugs: Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These drugs are integral to the company\u2019s plans for replacing the lost Humira revenue. AbbVie also has a deep pipeline with 50 drugs in mid- and late-stage development.\n\nSince the company\u2019s earnings report, analysts have assigned a consensus price target of $182.90. That\u2019s a 17% gain. Plus, AbbVie is a dividend king that not only has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years, but the stock has an attractive yield of 3.98%.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) jnj healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another biopharmaceutical company on this list of must-own overlooked stocks. Unlike AbbVie, investors can\u2019t say that JNJ stock is expensive. It has a current P/E of 9x and a forward P/E of 13x.\n\nNevertheless, valuation remains an issue as investors are trying to price JNJ stock without its consumer products division that it spun off as Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) in 2023. The company is also working to resolve its long-running lawsuits stemming from its talc powder. In January, AbbVie announced it was moving forward on a $6.475 billion proposed settlement of tens of thousands of lawsuits. However, there may still be some work to do.\n\nThe past shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. But the bullish case for JNJ stock is about the future. And its acquisition of Shockwave Medical (NASDAQ:SWAV) is a key part of that. The $13.1 billion acquisition will bring Shockwave\u2019s first-to-market intravascular lithotripsy technology (ILT) under Johnson & Johnson\u2019s MedTech division.\n\nOnce this acquisition becomes accretive to JNJ\u2019s top and bottom lines, JNJ stock will look extremely attractive for more than just its dividend which has a 3.48% yield. And with 62 years of consecutive dividend increases, Johnson & Johnson is another dividend king on this list.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the third and final dividend king on this list of must-own overlooked stocks. The consumer staples giant has been largely able to pass along some of its higher producer costs. But growth is slowing, and there is concern that consumer spending is slowing as well. Just as Pepsi benefits from both beverage and snack food sales when consumers trade up, it can suffer when consumers trade down.\n\nThis pessimism is reflected in PEP stock, which is essentially flat in 2024 and down about 5% in the last 12 months. That\u2019s not a massive dip to buy, but the stock is trading at around $170 which has served as a level of support and resistance in the last two years.\n\nHistory shows that buying dips, no matter how small, in PEP stock is a solid strategy. One reason has to do with the company\u2019s previously mentioned dividend which yields 2.96% as of this writing and has been growing for 53 consecutive years.\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSofi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) falls under the category of \u201cyeah, but\u201d stocks. Okay, I invented the category, but the premise is this. Sofi has largely delivered what it has said it would do. It was an online lender primarily known for providing student loans. Yeah, but it wasn\u2019t a real bank. Then it got its\u00a0bank charter. Yeah, but it wasn\u2019t profitable. Now it\u2019s delivered two straight quarters of positive adjusted EPS.\n\nStill the stock can\u2019t seem to get out of the snares of short sellers. A considerable 18% of the SOFI stock float is being shorted. And with only 38% of the shares owned by institutions, it\u2019s been a tough hold.\n\nSOFI stock is bouncing around $6.80. The good news is this has been a solid level of support. The bad news is that the company continues to revisit this level. The key will come from future growth, and in that regard being an internet-only bank lowers the company\u2019s customer acquisition costs.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is down 24% in the last 12 months and nearly 50% since its peak of near $60 in November 2021. The rise and fall of PFE stock was entirely predictable. The company was first-to-market with a vaccine for Covid-19. And it enjoyed the benefits of that position in its revenue and earnings.\n\nHowever, as demand for the company\u2019s Covid-19 products wanes, so does the stock which is facing difficult comparisons. That said, Pfizer is being overlooked for many reasons, some of which have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the stock.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the buying thesis. The mRNA technology that was used in the Covid-19 vaccine is already being used to develop other vaccines. The company is also making strides in oncology as well as areas such as gene therapy and precision medicine. And Pfizer has the balance sheet to get these products to the finish line whether it goes alone or through acquisition.\n\nAnalysts have a consensus Hold rating on PFE stock, but the price target is 37% higher. That\u2019s a discrepancy that makes it tempting to start a position. That\u2019s particularly true because, while you wait, you\u2019re getting a dividend with a 5.97% yield.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolar stocks have been hit and miss for investors. There are stocks like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) that are ripping higher. But a company like Enphase Energy (NYSE:ENPH), which was a darling of the solar sector in 2021 and 2022 has been having a rough time.\n\nThe company serves a largely residential audience and has been faced with declining revenue which has caused earnings to turn negative. Simply put, Enphase desperately needs a rate cut that will stimulate home buying and consumer investment in solar technology.\n\nThat may have to wait until 2025, but here\u2019s why you may want to put Enphase on a list of must-own overlooked stocks. Analysts have a consensus price target of $127.12. That\u2019s 2% lower than the price as of this writing. But 22 out of 42 analysts give ENPH stock a Strong Buy or Buy rating. That suggests there may be a bigger dip coming for ENPH stock, but that would be a good time to take a position.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) Norwegian Cruise Line ship arriving at a port. NCLH stock.\n\nSource: Ian_Stewart / Shutterstock\n\nCruise line stocks were a no-brainer long-term buy in 2020 and 2021. The industry was decimated by the global pandemic. But the smart money knew the industry would come back as it has. However, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) has been largely ignored. Investors have a high bar and little patience. All it took was a slight miss on the top line to spook investors and turn NCLH stock negative for the year.\n\nBut this could be the stock\u2019s time to shine. Analysts are lining up behind Norwegian on expectations of earnings growth that could reach 30%, not just this year but for each of the next three years. That would help the cruise line retire a significant chunk of the $14 billion net debt load it\u2019s still carrying.\n\nTo deliver on those projections, it seems like the company is counting on younger travelers. The company recently cited millennial and Gen-Z passengers as being its fastest growing demographic. That could be a double-edged sword if the economy worsens. However, over time these are the passengers that will have growing income to spend on experiences.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Readers hoping to buy PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 7th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of June.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.355 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.42 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that PepsiCo has a trailing yield of 3.1% on the current share price of US$172.90. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether PepsiCo's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether PepsiCo can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nSee our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 76% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. It could become a concern if earnings started to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether PepsiCo generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 94% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.\n\nWhile PepsiCo's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to PepsiCo's ability to maintain its dividend.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're discomforted by PepsiCo's 5.5% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. PepsiCo has delivered 9.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIs PepsiCo an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's definitely not great to see earnings per share shrinking. The company paid out an acceptable percentage of its income, but an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow over the past year. It's not that we think PepsiCo is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.\n\nHaving said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with PepsiCo. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for PepsiCo and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

        "title": "Is PepsiCo (PEP) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PepsiCo (PEP) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nPepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 57.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PEP Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEP\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in PEP?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $8.17.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, PepsiCo (PEP) closed at $171.15, marking a -1.29% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.74%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 1.06%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.58%.\n\nThe food and beverage company's stock has dropped by 1.44% in the past month, falling short of the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 0.09% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.27%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of PepsiCo in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on July 11, 2024. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.16, marking a 3.35% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $22.68 billion, up 1.59% from the year-ago period.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $8.17 per share and a revenue of $94.55 billion, indicating changes of +7.22% and +3.37%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% higher. PepsiCo presently features a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nInvestors should also note PepsiCo's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.23. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 19.43.\n\nWe can also see that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.83. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Beverages - Soft drinks industry stood at 2.83 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 164, finds itself in the bottom 35% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In a bold prediction in October 2022, Elon Musk assured investors that Tesla would produce 50,000 Tesla Semi trucks by 2024. However, the reality has unfolded quite differently as the production of the Tesla Semi has been affected by delays and setbacks, much to the frustration of eager customers.\n\nTesla initially aimed to have the Semi in production by 2019. Fast forward to late 2022, and the company finally unveiled its long-anticipated Semi truck. A high-volume production facility for the Semi is currently under construction at Giga Nevada, with the first set of vehicles expected to roll off the line in late 2025. For external customers, deliveries are slated to begin in 2026, as confirmed by Tesla executive Lars Moravy during the company\u2019s first quarter earnings call last month.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nRegular investors can join the U.S. military in supporting next-gen AI robotics for just $500. A startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cubanand opens a round for regular investors at $250.\n\nThe delay has left many customers, including industry giants like PepsiCo, in a challenging position. PepsiCo, one of the few to receive the Tesla Semi, currently has 36 trucks deployed in its fleet, with plans to expand to 86 Semis soon.\n\nHowever, other customers, like ASKO Norway, have also faced long waits with no end. Svein Sollie, the transportation director at ASKO Norway, expressed his dissatisfaction, noting that despite placing a deposit for 10 Semis back in 2017, they have not received any. \"We are not happy with the situation at Tesla,\" Sollie remarked to Reuters. \"(It\u2019s) almost seven years now, it\u2019s a long time to wait.\"\n\nUPS, another major customer, reserved 125 Tesla Semis in 2017. A spokesperson for the package delivery giant stated that they are \"working closely with Tesla to determine a date for us to take delivery of the trucks\" but did not provide further details.\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\n\nThere are also new developments regarding the truck\u2019s price. At launch, Tesla set the price for the 500-mile version of the Semi truck at $180,000 and the 300-mile version at $150,000.\n\nSacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management provided a grant of $4.5 million to PepsiCo to buy 18 Tesla Semi trucks. This grant was part of the agency\u2019s initiative to promote the adoption of electric vehicles in the region, and it significantly reduced the cost of the trucks for PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, that also means that PepsiCo bought the trucks for $250,000 apiece, making the price the company paid with Sacramento\u2019s grant approximately 40% higher than the initially announced price for the longer-range version of the highly anticipated truck.\n\nSeveral other companies that have placed their orders are still waiting for their trucks and have, in the meantime, turned to alternatives. Sysco, Schneider National, UPS, and Walmart Canada have begun incorporating dozens of Daimler Truck\u2019s Freightliner eCascadia electric big rigs into their operations.\n\nThis emphasizes the urgency of transitioning to electric fleets and the practical challenges of relying solely on Tesla\u2019s Semi, despite the range of eCascadia being half of what Tesla originally promised for the Semi (230 vs. 500 miles).\n\nAll in all, Tesla has made under 200 trucks since the prototype was unveiled in late 2017. This figure includes Tesla\u2019s own fleet of around 100 trucks doing test runs between its facilities.\n\nAs 2024 progresses, Tesla\u2019s ambitious goal of producing 50,000 Semis is far from reality. The company\u2019s production capabilities and supply chain constraints have resulted in significant delays, leaving customers to seek alternative solutions to fulfill their electric truck requirements.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.

        "content": "The brand is tapping its star-studded roster to inspire the next generation of athletes to focus on their inner \"IT\" as surprising new data from Gatorade shows external pressures are keeping Gen Z out of sports\n\nCHICAGO, May 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Gatorade, the world's most superior sports drink, announced the return of its iconic tagline, \"Is It In You?\", with the largest campaign in the brand's history. The tagline, first cemented into sports culture in the 1990s and early 2000s with Michael Jordan dripping in Gatorade-colored sweat, reintroduces the concept of \"IT\" \u2013 the inner drive that fuels greatness \u2013 with a modern twist for a new generation of athletes. The original campaign, which helped fuel Gatorade's growth, returns as the brand maintains its strong position leading the sports drink category.\n\nBeing an athlete looks a lot different in 2024 than it did three decades ago, and it comes with a new set of pressures and distractions. Ultimately, that's keeping the next generation out of the game, according to new data from Gatorade that shows among Gen Z athletes who stopped playing sports, 53% cited it was due to external factors like social pressures and unrealistic expectations. As the leading sports drink brand, Gatorade is tapping its elite roster to help relaunch \"Is It In You?\" and rally athletes everywhere to silence the noise and focus on what's inside.\n\n\"As the brand that has been on the sidelines fueling athletes for decades, we're committed to not only helping them stay in the game but also celebrating their unique 'IT',\" saidGatorade Chief Brand Officer, Anuj Bhasin. \"The return of 'Is It In You?', our biggest campaign of all time, is about acknowledging how much the sports landscape has changed, while reminding athletes that one thing hasn't \u2013 the inner drive that fuels you \u2013 and that's what matters most.\"\n\n\"Is It In You?\" makes its modern-day debut with a powerful 60-second film, \"IT Hasn't Changed\", to remind athletes everywhere that it's not about hype, clout, clicks or likes \u2013 it's inner drive that fuels greatness. The film is narrated by none other than Michael Jordan, Gatorade's longest standing athlete partner, and features the stories of how several of Gatorade's roster athletes \u2013 including Josh Allen, Caitlin Clark, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Jayson Tatum, A'ja Wilson, and DJ Lagway, Gatorade's 2023-2024 National Football Player of the Year \u2013 have overcome their own obstacles by tapping into their personal \"IT\".\n\nStory continues\n\n\"With 'Is It In You?' in the '90s, we inspired a generation,\" said Michael Jordan, Gatorade's longest standing athlete partner, six-time NBA Champion, five-time NBA MVP and 14-time NBA All-Star. \"The return of 'Is It In You?' is another chapter in greatness for Gatorade, a brand that has fueled champions for decades and relentlessly serves athletes on and off the field.\"\n\nThe film made its debut during the NBA Western Conference Finals Game 4 last night, and the campaign will be unmissable throughout the summer, including a colored sweat takeover on social media from Gatorade's athlete roster, custom filters on Snapchat and Instagram for consumers to recreate the iconic colored sweat images, just like their favorite Gatorade athletes, billboards in cities across the country, and more. Fans should make sure to follow along on Gatorade's social media accounts in the coming weeks to see what else the brand is dropping to celebrate the return of \"Is It In You?\".\n\nThe campaign launch comes on the heels of a strong first half for the brand.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Celsius Holdings Inc. shares dropped by the most in more than three years after industry sales data signaled that the energy-drink maker\u2019s revenue growth is cooling.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Moves to Fastest Settlement of Trades in a Century For Private Credit\u2019s Top Talent, $1 Million a Year Is Not Enough Israeli Airstrike and Egyptian Guard\u2019s Death Ratchet Up Tensions Treasury Yields Spike After Pair of Weak US Sales: Markets Wrap Catering to the Ultra-Rich Is a Booming Business in Australia\n\nThe stock tumbled as much as 19% on Tuesday, wiping out roughly $4 billion of the company\u2019s market value. Celsius\u2019 year-over-year sales growth in tracked US channels slowed during the week ended May 18 compared to earlier in the month, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Serotta, citing NielsenIQ data. He also said the company\u2019s market share, excluding its powder products, slipped in recent weeks, and its percentage of sales on promotion increased.\n\nCelsius is more likely to have an outsized share-price reaction to this data than larger multinational firms given a bigger portion of its revenue comes from the US, so the data are seen as a closer read of business trends, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Gerald Pascarelli. As a less mature company, Celsius is also largely valued on top-line trends and market-share gains, instead of earnings, he added.\n\n\u201cSome of the more near-term data didn\u2019t look as good as people were hoping, but I think anytime you have a double-digit move I would classify it as an overreaction,\u201d Pascarelli said referring to Tuesday\u2019s stock decline.\n\nFor the week ended May 18, Celsius\u2019 year-over-year sales growth in tracked US channels slowed to 39%, down from 50% for the week ended May 4, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Serotta wrote in a note.\n\nPascarelli at Wedbush said trends were widely expected to decelerate this month and potentially in June, before an anticipated improvement in July following retailers\u2019 shelf resets.\n\nDespite the plunge, Celsius shares remain up more than 40% this year, still outperforming consumer staples peers.\n\nStephens Inc. analyst Jim Salera said investors are also concerned about additional headwinds related to inventory changes made by Celsius distributor PepsiCo Inc.\n\nAfter hosting meetings with Celsius Chief Executive Officer John Fieldly, Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan warned in a May 27 note that second-quarter sales could again be affected as PepsiCo changes the amount of Celsius inventory it holds. Adjustments weighed on Celsius sales in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cPepsiCo could further reduce Celsius inventories, similar to 1Q24, resulting in 2Q24 sales below end-demand,\u201d Astrachan wrote in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares in PepsiCo, which holds a stake in Celsius, slid as much as 3.4% on Tuesday. Industry data also recently signaled weaker trends for the snack and soft-drink giant, in contrast to rival Coca-Cola Co.\n\nSalera viewed the slump in Celsius stock as a buying opportunity. He sees the company continuing to gain shelf space at retailers, which will increase the visibility of the brand and support new household growth.\n\n--With assistance from Janet Freund.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point The Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade The Dodgers Mogul and the Indian Infrastructure Giant That Wasn\u2019t When Business Is Just a Game A Hidden Variable in the Presidential Race: Fears of \u2018Trump Forever\u2019\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Grocery Stocks to Fill Your Cart With Steady Gains",
        "content": "Today, we spotlight three grocery stocks to buy. These Wall Street shares benefit from their defensive nature, providing stability during market volatility. Over time, sales of groceries have consistently grown, even as other household expenditures have declined in terms of economic uncertainty.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, the food and grocery retail market saw a 5.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Changing consumer preferences, population growth and new shopping habits have all contributed to this increase. Meanwhile, the rise of e-commerce has significantly boosted the grocery sector. U.S. online grocery sales in April reached $8.5 billion, up over 4% from the previous year. Elsewhere, the global grocery market, valued at $12.4 trillion in 2024, will likely exceed $17 trillion by 2034. With that information, here are the top three grocery stocks in June.\n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale Club (BJ) BJ Wholesale (BJ) storefront with red BJ logo on front\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the first grocery stocks for today is BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ). It operates a chain of membership warehouse clubs, offering products at competitive prices. As a potential addition to your portfolio searching for grocery stocks to buy, BJ\u2019s could be an interesting option due to its membership model, value focus and growth potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBJ\u2019s Wholesale\u2019s most recent earnings report painted a positive picture. The company reported robust top-line growth, with total revenue climbing 4.1% year-over-year (YOY) to $4.9 billion. This growth was fueled by a combination of factors, including a 1.6% increase in comparable club sales and a 21% surge in e-commerce sales.\u00a0 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) stayed at $0.85.\n\nAnalysts note that the membership club\u2019s future holds several promising avenues for growth, including the store expansion strategy.\u00a0Management plans to open 12 new clubs in 2024, primarily along the East Coast. Additionally, the company\u2019s recent expansion into gas stations provides an attractive revenue stream and further incentivizes membership.\n\nAnother exciting growth prospect lies in soaring e-commerce sales, reflecting the growing consumer preference for online grocery shopping.\u00a0The company invests heavily in its digital platform, improving its fulfillment capabilities and user experience. This focus on e-commerce positions BJ\u2019s Wholesale to capture a larger share of the online grocery market, which is expected to continue its rapid expansion.\n\nAs a result, BJ stock is up 32% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the shares are trading at 22.5 times forward earnings and 0.6 times sales. Interested readers may look to buy the dip in BJ shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest retailer by revenue,\u00a0Walmart (NYSE:WMT) offers a strong value proposition among grocery stocks. Over the years, budget-conscious consumers and its grocery segment have driven Walmart\u2019s overall success.\u00a0The company boasts a massive physical footprint and is aggressively expanding its e-commerce grocery presence, making it a well-rounded option for investors seeking exposure to the grocery sector.\n\nWalmart\u2019s latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 paints a promising picture. The company reported total revenues of $161.51 billion, with Walmart U.S. contributing $108.67 billion, Walmart International $29.83 billion, and Sam\u2019s Club $21.44 billion. The company\u2019s gross profit margin stood at 24.5%, while the net profit margin was 2.88%. Walmart\u2019s adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.60, reflecting a significant growth of 22.4% year-over-year.\n\nOn 16 May, Walmart announced the global launch of Walmart Luminate, a cutting-edge data analytics platform designed to provide suppliers with actionable insights into customer behavior and market trends. This initiative aims to enhance supply chain efficiency, optimize inventory management and drive sales growth by leveraging advanced analytics and real-time data.\n\nWMT stock has advanced 24% YTD, and the dividend yield is 1.3%. The shares are changing hands at 27.8 times forward earnings and 0.8 times sales. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast for WMT stock stands at $70. They suggest an upside potential of 7%.\n\niShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK) Couple shopping at grocery store together. Consumers. Consumer stocks.\n\nSource: Prostock-studio / Shutterstock\n\nNext on our list of grocery stocks is the iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK). Although not exclusively focused on grocery retail, IYK is still a close approximation for investors interested in the segment. This ETF provides broad exposure to the U.S. consumer staples sector, including various consumer goods like food and household items.\n\nLaunched in June 2000, IYK currently comprises 55 stocks, while the top ten holdings represent almost two-thirds of the net assets, which are $1.3 billion. Sector-wise allocation is diversified, with the majority invested in Food, Beverage and Tobacco (57%), followed by Household & Personal Products (27%), Health Care Equipment & Services (8%), Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail (6%), and Materials (2%).\n\nAmong its leading holdings are household names such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) and Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ).\n\nSince January, IYK has gained over 4%. Currently trading at 21 times trailing earnings and four times book value, the ETF deserves your attention. With an expense ratio of 0.4% and a dividend yield of 2.6%, IYK presents an attractive option for investors seeking to capitalize on the defensive consumer goods sector growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "3 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Lock Away for the Long Term",
        "content": "Investors seeking to build sustainable wealth over the long term regard buy-and-hold stocks as one of the most reliable investment strategies. By focusing on fundamentally strong companies and holding their stocks for extended periods, investors can typically enjoy substantial returns. Meanwhile, they can better mitigate the risks associated with short-term market volatility.\n\nThe principle behind buy-and-hold investing is simple. First, identify quality stocks with strong growth prospects, solid financials and competitive advantages. Then, hold onto these investments through market ups and downs. Historically, this approach has been proven to generate impressive returns. Research suggests that the S&P 500 index has delivered an average annual return of approximately 10% over the past 90 years. Such an impressive performance underscores the power of long-term investing.\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, is a staunch advocate of the buy-and-hold strategy. His investment philosophy centers on purchasing stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and holding them indefinitely. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has consistently outperformed the market, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. With that information, let\u2019s delve into three stocks that are well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and stability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBeverage company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as a standout player in the energy drink market. It captures the attention of health-conscious consumers with its unique beverages. Management\u2019s innovative product line has resonated well with a growing demographic focused on fitness and wellness.\n\nIn early May, the energy drink company reported robust first quarter fiscal 2024 results, highlighting its ability to scale its operations and grow market share. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year (YOY) to $356 million. Gross margin surged to a record high of 51%, benefiting from economies of scale in sourcing. First quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents jumped 108% YOY.\n\nIn fact, CELH\u2019s strong sales momentum is primarily attributed to its success in expanding its global distribution channels. It has a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0for the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the beverage company has recently announced expansions into the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. Currently, international markets account for just 5%\u00a0of revenues. This suggests robust growth opportunities outside the U.S. Consensus analyst estimates call for 40% earnings growth through the next two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), CELH stock has surged by close to 75%. As a result, the stock currently trades at an expensive forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 94x. And, its trailing sales ratio of 15.8x indicates high growth expectations. Investors may want to wait for a pullback toward the $90 level.\n\nDiebold Nixdorf (DBD) A Diebold Nixdorf (DBD) sign featuring the company logo.\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinancial and retail technology company Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE:DBD) is a company known for its ATM managed services. DBD offers a variety of security solutions and self-service technologies. This makes it a potential pick for investors looking for buy-and-hold technology stocks in the financial transformation space.\n\nFirst quarter metrics showed mixed results for Diebold Nixdorf. Revenue grew 5.1% YOY to $897.1 million, falling short of analyst expectations. Nonetheless, the company delivered positive net income of $45.2 million, suggesting a strategic focus on profitability.\n\nRecently, Diebold Nixdorf has unveiled Vynamic\u00ae Connection Points 7 (VCP 7), its latest self-service software, at the Intersect Conference. Investors are hopeful that VCP 7 could streamline digital transformation for financial institutions, potentially increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\nSince January, DBD stock has advanced 54%, trading favorably at 10.5x earnings and almost 1x sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for DBD stock stands at $44.60.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) An outside image of a Micron Technology, Inc. headquarters. MU stock. momentum stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) specializes in high-performance memory and storage solutions that are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.\n\nIn its Q2 of fiscal year 2024 report, Micron revealed strong momentum across all of its four segments, driven by strong AI server demand. Revenue jumped 58% YOY to $5.82 billion. Adjusted EPS improved to 42 cents, compared to a loss of $1.91 per share in the previous year.\n\nThe ramp-up of investments in data centers, cloud and AI is boosting demand for Micron\u2019s offerings. With high-bandwidth memory (HBM) widely regarded as a bottleneck technology for AI, Micron\u2019s flagship HMB3E chip for AI servers is already sold out for 2025. The chipmaker is ramping up its HBM offering with 30% less power than the competition. Amid\u00a0growing concerns\u00a0about AI\u2019s power consumption, HBM3E is expected to boost Micron\u2019s market share and lead to sustained\u00a0pricing strength due to tight supply.\n\nAlso, the company\u2019s diverse segments and products are demonstrating robust growth momentum, which helps minimize revenue concentration risks for Micron. In Q3, management anticipates YOY revenue growth to accelerate to 76%. Record revenue expectations for fiscal 2025 indicate management\u2019s confidence in its current growth momentum over the next several quarters.\n\nSince January, MU stock has increased by 49%. Shares are changing hands at 7.7 times trailing sales. Wall Street remains optimistic for Micron stock with a potential upside of 10% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "content": "Dividend investment can make you wealthy but you need to pick the right stocks. Whether you are just beginning your investment journey or are a professional at it, there is nothing better than receiving income without having to work for it. The earnings season is\u00a0a good\u00a0time to target top dividend stocks to add them to your portfolio. I\u2019ve identified seven dividend stocks\u00a0to buy as they are\u00a0ready to soar after having reported strong fundamentals. These are dividend kings with steady cash flow and a commitment to rewarding shareholders.\n\nThese companies have survived several market ups and downs and can weather any storm. Some of these stocks are trading at a discount due to the current economic uncertainty and market volatility, but these are gems worth holding on to for a decade. They will offer passive income with capital growth over the years. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: PepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nBeverage and snack food giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0hasn\u2019t had\u00a0a good\u00a0start to the year. PEP stock is up 3% year-to-date and hasn\u2019t rallied much.\u00a0Trading at $179, the stock is a buy in the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts business is doing well\u00a0and\u00a0even if the company sees a drop in sales volume in one quarter, it wouldn\u2019t affect the long-term business outlook. If you have been waiting for the stock to dip before you\u00a0make your\u00a0move, now is the time.\n\nPepsiCo is so much more than a beverage company and generates more than half of the income from the food segment, this\u00a0diversification is\u00a0the reason\u00a0you should bet your money on the company. It allows the company to enjoy steady growth. In the first quarter, PepsiCo saw a 2.7% rise in organic sales and\u00a0is projecting\u00a0a 4% rise in sales throughout 2024.\n\nIf you are a passive income investor, a dividend yield of 3.02% and a steady rise in dividends should be reason enough to hold on to the stock. With summer approaching, PepsiCo could have better days ahead.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend aristocrat Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a safe stock in\u00a0times of\u00a0market uncertainty. Both of its segments, innovative medicine, and\u00a0MedTech\u00a0are thriving.\n\nThe innovative medicine sector reported a 2.5% jump in sales to hit $13.6 billion\u00a0while\u00a0the MedTech division grew 6.3% to\u00a0hit\u00a0$7.8. billion. The company enjoys a dominating position in the market, and the success of its drugs and cardiovascular goods has helped achieve tremendous growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrading for $149, the stock has dropped 6% YTD, and this dip is a chance to make the move. It is\u00a0very\u00a0close to the 52-week low of $143 and might continue to drop before it soars. This dividend stock will add stability and safety to your investment portfolio. It\u00a0enjoys\u00a0a dividend yield of 3.31% and announced a 4.2%\u00a0rise in dividend\u00a0in the first-quarter results.\u00a0JNJ is one of the top dividend stocks to buy.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u00a0enjoys\u00a0steady cash flow growth and ended the quarter with $26 billion\u00a0in cash. It has a top-tier balance sheet and has\u00a0been paying\u00a0dividends for 62 years. Buy the stock before it soars.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) the American Express logo etched into wood\n\nSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are two reasons to bet on American Express (NYSE:AXP). One is\u00a0the growing transition from cash to cards. The demand for cards is going to be on the rise as people across the world continue to use their debit and credit cards.\n\nSecond, the company has successfully managed to capture the\u00a0attention of the younger generation.\u00a0About 60% of its new customer accounts came from Gen Z and millennials.\u00a0This\u00a0specific\u00a0demographic is jumping on the earning ladder and could be using debit and credit cards for all\u00a0of\u00a0their purchases, making American Express indispensable.\n\nAmerican Express reported an 11% YOY rise in revenue for the first quarter to hit $15.8 billion and a 34% YOY jump in the net income to reach $2.4 billion. It added 3.4 million cards in the quarter.\n\nTrading at $235 today, the stock is up 25% YTD and has increased 56% in the past 12 months. The company has a steady source of income\u00a0and\u00a0as the usage of cards increases, American Express will make more money. It increased the dividend by 17% this year and\u00a0enjoys\u00a0a yield of 1.19%.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) two construction workers on a worksite\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThere are several reasons to bet on Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock. The largest construction equipment manufacturer in the world has reported impressive first-quarter results. The company enjoys a diversified business that caters to multiple industries\u00a0and\u00a0its revenue came in at $15.8 billion\u00a0and\u00a0the net income soared 47% YOY to hit $2.86 billion.\n\nThe management expects the 2024 sales to be similar to 2023\u00a0but\u00a0I do not think it will impact the dividends.\u00a0Trading at $350 today, CAT stock is up 19% YTD and 67% in the past 12 months.\n\nIt has an envious balance sheet and a steady cash flow\u00a0which\u00a0allows\u00a0the company to offer a dividend yield of 1.48%.\u00a0It is currently focusing on growing its service revenue so\u00a0that the\u00a0company does not suffer during extreme market conditions.\n\nCaterpillar holds a global presence and operates in an industry that can never run out of demand. It is a mature company set to benefit from the growing importance given to the construction industry.\u00a0The company has raised dividends for three consecutive decades, making it one of\u00a0the top dividend stocks to own.\n\nDividend Stocks to Buy: Walmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving impressed with the first-quarter numbers, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock went from $59 to $64 in a day.\u00a0Trading at $64 today, the stock is up 22% YTD and has been quietly moving in the upward direction.\u00a0As inflation cools, Walmart will be the first\u00a0one\u00a0to benefit because we\u00a0are never going to\u00a0stop spending on groceries and household essentials.\n\nIt reported a revenue of $161 billion\u00a0with\u00a0the EPS coming in at $0.60. The company isn\u2019t the one to sit back and watch consumer preferences change, instead, it pounces on every opportunity to grow. It has invested in the e-commerce segment and saw a 22% jump in e-commerce sales in the recent quarter.\n\nDespite the economic challenges, Walmart is ready to take off. Having paid dividends for over 50 years, the company recently announced a 9% dividend hike. With a dividend yield of 1.28%, WMT stock is a long-term buy and hold\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0looks inexpensive to me at the current level. It certainly has the potential to raise dividends in the coming quarters and is one of the best dividend stocks to buy.\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) The logo for Morgan Stanley is displayed on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother fintech company I love, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)\u00a0has bounced back with an improvement in the investment banking sector. The company saw a 16% jump in revenue in this investment banking unit\u00a0while\u00a0the wealth management unit was up by 5%.\n\nIt reported\u00a0a revenue\u00a0of $15.14 billion and saw a whopping 138% jump in the EPS quarter over quarter and 19% YOY, to $2.02.\n\nMorgan Stanley is sitting in a strong position\u00a0right now\u00a0and is building momentum for the months ahead. It also saw a 100% YOY jump in the debt underwriting revenue. A rate cut and an improved economic outlook could benefit the company.\n\nExchanging hands for $98, the stock is just up 5% YTD\u00a0and\u00a0I believe it has a long runway. It has a dividend yield of 3.44% and pays an annual dividend of $3.40.\u00a0Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite stock, Morgan\u00a0Stanley\u00a0is here to stay\u00a0and\u00a0the investment banking sector will keep driving growth.\n\nDomino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) A tall Domino's Pizza (DPZ) sign stands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nFast food giant Domino\u2019s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ)\u00a0\u00a0is making slow and steady moves.\u00a0Trading at $502 as of writing, DPZ stock is up 21% YTD and 63% in the last 12 months. The company\u2019s dividend is as tasty as the pizza. With a dividend yield of 1.20%, Domino\u2019s has raised the payout for the past 12 years\u00a0and\u00a0I am\u00a0certain\u00a0it will continue doing the same.\n\nIn the first quarter, revenue increased 7.3%\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0reported an EPS of $3.58, better than expectations. Its net income jumped 20% to $126 million, and the same-store sales grew 5.6% in the\u00a0U.S.\n\nDomino\u2019s expansion strategy is paying off, and it has successfully managed to open multiple stores across the globe. It aims to open 1,100 stores by 2028. The company\u2019s effective marketing and pricing\u00a0has\u00a0helped it reach new highs, and I am\u00a0certain\u00a0your investment will pay off in the coming years. Domino\u2019s is a global leader, a household name, and has a long way to go.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Ahead of the UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League Final, Lay\u2019s and Gatorade launched a series of community initiatives in this year\u2019s host city of Bilbao, Spain, to give young female athletes more access to football \u2013 including hosting an action-packed Gatorade 5v5 tournament on a newly unveiled Lay\u2019s RePlay pitch.\n\nAhead of the\u00a0UEFA Women's Champions League (UWCL) Final, Lay's and Gatorade seamlessly brought together the power, scale and resources of the two brands to launch a series of community initiatives in this year's host city of Bilbao, Spain, to give young female athletes more access to football \u2013 including hosting an action-packed Gatorade 5v5 tournament on a newly unveiled Lay's RePlay pitch this weekend.\n\nDespite the rise in popularity of women's sports \u2013 particularly women's football \u2013 there is still a way to go until female players receive the same level of support as their male equivalents. PepsiCo, a proud partner of UEFA Women's Football, continues to invest in initiatives across its brand portfolio to drive engagement and conversation within the women's game, while inspiring women's opportunities and participation in the sport from grassroots to professional levels.\n\nLay's RePlay, a global initiative created in partnership with the UEFA Foundation for Children and Common Goal, aims to bring joy and access to play to deserving communities by creating environmentally friendly football pitches partially made of reused chip bags. Gatorade reaffirmed its commitment to supporting amateur footballers across the world by leveraging the newly opened Lay's RePlay pitch for its 5v5 program, a grassroots tournament designed to promote and showcase equal opportunities for young talent.\n\n23 MAY: Lay's RePlay Pitch \u2013 Bilbao, Spain \u2013Errekalde Sports Center\n\nOn May 23rd, Lay's RePlay unveiled its 11th pitch with a variety of local activations for the Bilbao community, including a female artist-designed mural to represent and inspire the community and an unveiling of the centre circle, as an homage to UWCL opening ceremonies, to unveil the brand-new pitch. Manchester City player Laia Aleixandri and former Spanish professional footballer Fernando Llorente connected with young athletes on-site, speaking to their personal experiences in football, emphasizing the benefits associated with playing and encouraging the girls to join the program to learn and grow on the pitch and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn\u00a0selecting Bilbao as the program's next impact epicenter, Lay's RePlay and partners, Common Goal, 'Bilbao Kirolak' (Municipality) and Fundazioa (Athletic Club Foundation), will offer inclusive sports programming for young migrant women footballers in the communities of Errekalde and Ibaiondo. This initiative provides access to sports training, educational resources, and a safe place to play, aiming to support socio-emotional growth and community building while fostering belonging, teamwork, and collaboration. In celebration of the initiative's Bilbao debut, participants, their families and the entire community came together at the new facility for a day filled with football fun and\u00a0inspiring words from football icons Laia Aleixandri and Fernando Llorente.\n\nLay's RePlay leverages the power of play and innovative sustainability to deliver positive outcomes for both the planet and people. To create a Lay's RePlay pitch, empty packs of chips are collected and made into pellets that form the underlying layer beneath the AstroTurf.\n\nWith pitches spanning the globe throughout communities in South Africa, Italy, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Colombia, Mexico and more \u2013 the program is already making a lasting impact, with 1.5K participants (per month) directly impacted through 8K hours of Lay's RePlay educational programming, and a further 2.3K (per month) wider community members indirectly impacted through general use of the pitch, special community events or families of the participants. Lay's RePlay builds on the work done by Lay's and the UEFA Foundation for Children that delivered three artificial football fields in the Za'atari and Azraq Refugee Camps in 2017 and 2018 and have since provided 35,000 people access to the sport.\n\n24 and 25 MAY: Gatorade 5v5 Tournament on Lay's RePlay Pitch \u2013 Bilbao, Spain\n\nOn May 24th, the latest iteration of Gatorade's 5v5 tournament took place on the new Lay's RePlay pitch in Bilbao, in tandem with the brand's global initiative, \"Confidence Coaches,\" which connects football legends with youth players. Understanding the common barriers women in sport face, chosen \"Confidence Coaches\" share stories and advice that fuels these up-and-coming players with the confidence they need to keep kicking. This year in Bilbao, Gatorade Confidence Coaches featured world class talent, including former English footballer Rachel Yankey, alongside Laia Aleixandri and Fernando Llorente. At the UWCL final on May 24, the trio met with the final girls' teams of the 5v5 tournament to talk confidence and self-esteem in competitive sports.\n\nIn alignment with Gatorade's People and Planet priorities, the Bilbao 5v5 tournament was executed with sustainability in mind, including all clothing and medals for the tournament produced as sustainably as possible (both materials and production).\n\nNow in its seventh year, 5v5 continues to deliver positive formative sporting experiences to thousands of young amateur athletes, ages 14 to 16, from diverse backgrounds, giving over 151,000 boys and girls (and counting!) the chance to excel in the sport they love.\n\nGatorade's \"Confidence Coach\" initiative, launched in 2023, aims to inspire future generations by partnering with iconic football players to serve as Confidence Coaches, who share their own experiences to help motivate aspiring players. Gatorade is thrilled to give young adults better opportunities to play sport and realize their potential and is committed to helping 2.5 million teens worldwide access the life changing power of sport by 2030.\n\nMustafa Shamseldin, Category Growth Officer and CMO International Foods, says: \"Lay's RePlay illuminates both the human and sustainability elements behind PepsiCo's mission of creating local activations that propel impact on a global scale. The opening of this pitch in Bilbao demonstrates the ongoing efforts and greater impact PepsiCo has on supporting women in sport \u2013 providing resources to educate, facilitate and inspire young women globally to pursue their passion for the beautiful game \u2013 and its fierce commitment to sustainability efforts \u2013 opening its 11th pitch, partially made of reused Lay's chip bags. Lay's and Gatorade joining forces in Bilbao to drive change for women in football is a prime example of what PepsiCo can accomplish with the Power of One.\"\n\nMark Kirkham, SVP and CMO International Beverages, says: \"Gatorade's 5v5 tournament provides an incredible opportunity for girls in grassroots football, and we know how important it is to facilitate truly inclusive participation for all genders. We give the talented players everything they need to succeed and play their best, including access to our inspiring Confidence Coaches. It was incredible to see how football legends Rachel, Laia and Fernando inspired the girls by giving them the confidence to win!\"\n\nLaia Aleixandri, Manchester City Footballer, says: \"The UWCL Final is always an exciting time for me. However, being able to be a part of the Lay's Replay and Gatorade 5v5 programs' shared vision of empowering women in football makes this year's Final extra special! Working alongside these amazing brands, I'm thrilled to be a role model for young female football players everywhere, showing them that dreams are worth chasing. Together, we're not just playing the game, we're changing it \u2013 making sure that every girl who loves football knows she belongs on the field.\"\n\nFernando Llorente, Former Professional Footballer, says: \"Lay's Replay and Gatorade 5V5 are amazing initiatives that go beyond the game - it's about making a difference for women athletes. Seeing both of these programs come to life in Bilbao during the UWCL Final is a special moment\u2014it shows how far we've come in making soccer more inclusive, especially for women. Teaming up with brands that share my passion for inclusivity allows me to not only inspire young female players but also to be a supportive ally in their journey. Together, we're rewriting the rules and creating a future where every player has an equal shot at success.\"\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT: Paul Bromley, paul.bromley@pepsico.com\n\nAbout PepsiCo\r\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.53%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.39%.\n\nComing into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 2.64% in the past month. In that same time, the Consumer Staples sector gained 3.66%, while the S&P 500 gained 6.06%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of PepsiCo in its upcoming release.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $22.68 billion, up 1.59% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.17 per share and a revenue of $94.55 billion, representing changes of +7.22% and +3.37%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.14% upward. Right now, PepsiCo possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that PepsiCo has a Forward P/E ratio of 22.3 right now. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 19.71 of its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.97. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. Beverages - Soft drinks stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.97 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 151, this industry ranks in the bottom 41% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "PepsiCo drivers described the all-electric Semi trucks as easy to handle and very comfortable to ride in. (Image: North American Council for Freight Efficiency)\n\nPepsiCo Beverages North America (NASDAQ: PEP) announced this week that it plans to add 50 Tesla electric semi-trucks to its California fleet as part of the company\u2019s mission to reach net-zero emissions by 2040.\n\nThe snack and beverage company plans to rollout the trucks throughout the next several months, according to an announcement. The trucks will operate out of the company\u2019s manufacturing and distribution facility in Fresno.\n\nPepsi will also add 75 Ford E-Transit electric vans to its California fleet at its 13 locations for deliveries and service support. The move to electrify vehicles is part of the company\u2019s goal to reduce emissions across its operations. The company already uses the Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) Class 8 trucks in a Sacramento bottling plant.\n\n\u201cOur fleet electrification is an important part of our pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) strategy and illustrates how sustainability is a core business strategy at PepsiCo\u2014 good for the planet, good for our business, and good for the communities we serve,\u201d John Dean, a PepsiCo president, said in the news release.\n\nRelated:\n\nPepsiCo praises Tesla Semi\u2019s performance on long-haul, regional loads\n\nTesla delivers fleet of Semi trucks to Pepsi facility in California\n\nTesla Semi Class 8 electric truck faces more delays\n\nTesla issues recall for Semi truck over roll-away risk\n\nForty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in California are caused by the transportation sector, according to the California Hydrogen Business Council, a Yorba Linda-based trade association. The state is driving the switch to emission-free heavy-duty trucks to meet its goal of reaching a 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A group of states have sued to stop the rule from taking effect.\n\nThe trucks coincide with a job training program for Reedley College and Duncan Polytechnic High School students, who will gain hands-on experience in the field of electric trucks and infrastructure maintenance.\n\nPepsi\u2019s Fresno facility is 170,000 square feet and distributes beverage products. The company installed chargers and battery energy storage systems ahead of the arrival of the trucks.\n\nCompany leaders have praised the trucks\u2019 performance, including its range \u2014 up to 450 miles a day. The company ordered the first round of trucks in 2017 when Tesla CEO Elon Musk first pitched the idea. Production suffered long delays.\n\nThe post PepsiCo to add 50 Tesla electric semi-trucks to California fleet appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Up 2.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for PepsiCo (PEP). Shares have added about 2.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PepsiCo due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nPepsiCo Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat, International Unit Aids\n\nPepsiCo has reported robust first-quarter 2024 results, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The company\u2019s results have been mainly aided by improvements in its international business, which delivered significant volume growth and organic revenue growth of 9%.\r\n\r\nPEP noted that each of its international businesses recorded at least high-single-digit organic revenue growth, along with organic volume growth across most units. Within the international business, organic revenues increased 9% for the convenient food business and 10% for the beverages category.\r\n\r\nThe results also reflect gains from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo\u2019s first-quarter core EPS of $1.61 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 and increased 7.3% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 7% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The company\u2019s reported EPS of $1.48 rose 6% year over year in the quarter. The impact of currency rates on the quarter\u2019s EPS was neutral.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $18,250 million rose 2.3% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,155 million. Revenues gained from an improved price/mix in the reported quarter, offset by a unit volume decline of 0.5% for the convenient food business and a flat unit volume for the beverage business. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 0.5%.\r\n\r\nOn an organic basis, revenues grew 2.7% year over year, driven by growth across categories and geographies, except for QFNA. The consolidated organic volume was down 2%, while effective net pricing improved 5% in the first quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments, except for QFNA and AMESA.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted year-over-year organic revenue growth of 3.7% for the first quarter, with an 8.1% gain from price/mix and a 4.4% decline in volume.\r\n\r\nOn a consolidated basis, the reported gross profit increased 1.5% year over year to $10,002 million. The core gross profit rose 2.9% year over year to $10,162 million. The reported gross margin contracted 43 basis points (bps), whereas the core gross margin expanded 37 bps.\r\n\r\nWe anticipated the core gross margin to be flat at 55.3% in the first quarter. In dollar terms, core gross profit was expected to increase 1.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company reported an operating income of $2,717 million rose 3.3% year over year. The core operating income grew 4.9% year over year to $2,939 million and the core constant-currency operating income improved 10%. The reported operating margin expanded 16 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 40 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted core SG&A expenses of $7.3 billion, which indicated year-over-year growth of 2.7%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses were anticipated at 39.9%, suggesting a 30-bps rise from the prior-year quarter. We expected a core operating margin of 15.4%, implying a 30-bps decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegmental Details\n\nThe company witnessed reported and organic revenue growth across all operating segments, except for QFNA. Revenues in the QFNA segment were impacted by certain product recalls and tough revenue growth comparison with the prior year.\r\n\r\nRevenues, on a reported basis, improved 2% each year over year in the FLNA and AMESA segments. Also, reported revenues rose 16% in Latin America, 1% in PBNA, 3% in Europe and 6% in the APAC segment. Organic revenues increased 2% for FLNA, 1% for PBNA, 8% for Latin America, 10% for Europe, 7% for AMESA and 11% for the APAC segment. However, revenues declined 24% for the QFNA segment on both reported and organic basis.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe company ended first-quarter 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $8,047 million, long-term debt of $37,707 million, and shareholders\u2019 equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $19,190 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $1,041 million as of Mar 23, 2024, compared with $392 million used as of Mar 25, 2023.\n\nOutlook\n\nPepsiCo has retained its view for 2024. The company expects organic revenue growth of at least 4% for 2024. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure. PEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and the core EPS by 1 percentage point in 2024, based on the current rates. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2024.\r\n\r\nBased on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects a core EPS of at least $8.15 for 2024. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $7.62 reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return a value worth $8.2 billion in 2024, including $7.2 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1 billion in 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, PepsiCo has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Safe Stocks to Bet on as Inflation, Rate Hike Concerns Grow",
        "content": "Concerns over inflation and fears of interest rate hikes came back, haunting investors on May 22 after the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s (FOMC) Apr 30-May 1 policy meeting were released.\n\nThe minutes revealed that the Federal Reserve remains concerned over rising inflation, which created panic among investors, leading to a massive selloff. All three major indexes that were on a rally retreated sharply, with the Dow recording its worst session in May, after hitting an all-time high last week.\n\nThe Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended 0.5%, 0.3% and 0.2% lower, respectively.\n\nWall Street had a solid first quarter before the rally briefly paused in April. The month of May has particularly been impressive for markets, with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notching new all-time closing highs.\n\nHowever, the upbeat sentiment was dampened following the release of the minutes of the FOMC policy meeting, which showed that there has hardly been any progress in recent months on lowering inflation.\n\nInflation rose in the first three months of the year before showing signs of cooling in April. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% month over month and 3.4% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 0.3% in April from the previous month, following a 0.4% increase in the first three months of the year. Year over year, CPI increased by 3.6% in April, representing the smallest monthly rise since April 2021.\n\nHowever, inflation remains a lot higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. The minutes also revealed that \u201cvarious participants\u201d are in favor of interest rate hikes if inflation fails to move lower in the near term.\n\nHigher interest rates do not bode well for the broader economy and could keep markets volatile for a longer period.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this situation, it would thus be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples like Portland General Electric Company POR, Atmos Energy Corporation ATO, Pinnacle California Water Service Group CWT, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP and McCormick & Company, Incorporated MKC.\n\nAlso, these belong to the category of low-beta stocks (beta greater than 0 but less than 1). Hence, the recommended approach is to invest in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nPortland General Electric Company is a vertically integrated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in Oregon. POR has more than a century of experience in power delivery. Portland General Electric Company generates power from a diverse mix of resources, including hydropower, coal and natural gas.\n\nStory continues\n\nPortland General Electric Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.4% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last 60 days. POR presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Portland General Electric Company has a beta of 0.56 and a current dividend yield of 4.19%.\n\nAtmos Energy Corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. ATO serves nearly 3.4 million customers in more than 1,400 communities in eight states, from the Blue Ridge Mountains in the East to the Rocky Mountains in the West. Atmos Energyoperates more than 72,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines as well as 5,700 miles of interstate pipelines.\n\nAtmos Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days. ATO presently has a Zacks Rank #2.

Let\u2019s examine three retirement stocks that strike the perfect balance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is by far my favorite pick when it comes to long-term dividend stocks.\u00a0While it is going through some tough times\u00a0right now, the stock has been\u00a0very\u00a0stable and consistent throughout its history.\u00a0It is\u00a0very\u00a0hard\u00a0not\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0drawn into a PepsiCo product if you walk down any snack aisle.\n\nThe growth here is far from over.

The\u00a0$36 billion international segment is expanding\u00a0at a brisk pace\u00a0while maintaining healthy profitability.\u00a0I\u2019m confident\u00a0this momentum can be sustained\u00a0given PepsiCo\u2019s focus markets like China and India.\n\nHowever, margins in the Frito-Lay North America business were\u00a0a bit\u00a0softer this reporting period.\u00a0The company expects these headwinds to ease going forward. The question remains whether PepsiCo will reinvest any potential savings to drive faster top-line growth or allow it to boost margins.\u00a0I believe\u00a0Frito-Lay margins can return to the lower 30% range, but the timing is still uncertain.\n\nRegardless, if you\u2019re a retiree, the short-term trends should\u00a0not matter much.\u00a0This business will continue to compound in the decades ahead, and it has a solid 3% dividend yield\u00a0to top it all off.

The stock is already showing signs of a recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere has been\u00a0growth in demand for some of their branded products, especially Dave\u2019s Killer Bread, which continues to attract more buyers each time.\n\nAdditionally, signs indicated that expenses were rising quicker than income.\u00a0Higher costs for staffing and technology\u00a0seem to be\u00a0cutting into the bottom line more than hoped.\u00a0Management aims to address this through changes and savings, but it\u2019s an area I\u2019ll be paying close attention to. The dividend yield is 3.8%.\n\nOn a brighter note,\u00a0it looks like\u00a0new prospects are being won over to Flowers Foods\u2019 offerings faster than projected. This extra business should help maximize the use of their facilities. I also see potential in their plans to upgrade warehouses and transportation fleets. While costly\u00a0at first, streamlining operations could serve them well in the long term.

Historically, McDonald\u2019s has weathered economic storms remarkably well. The stock gained 8.5% in 2008 as the S&P 500 plunged 37% during the Great Recession. And despite being a restaurant, McDonald\u2019s only saw a 3% revenue dip in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. The Golden Arches have earned their reputation as an all-weather stock.\n\nWhile the\u00a04.6% revenue growth to $6.17 billion slightly beat estimates, the earnings miss with EPS of $2.70 coming in $0.03 below expectations is concerning. Comps growth is actually negative in the U.S. However, this is due to broad-based consumer pressures that are affecting every company. The dividend\u00a0yields\u00a02.51%. In the long run, MCD is unlikely to disappoint.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., PepsiCo, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as two micro-cap stocks FitLife Brands, Inc. and National Presto Industries, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nAMD\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics \u2013 Semiconductors industry over the past six months (+35.8% vs. +35.6%). The company is benefiting from portfolio strength and an expanding partner base. Data Center revenues benefited from the strong adoption of AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs and a double-digit percentage increase in CPU sales.\r\n\r\nIn cloud, server CPU revenues increased year over year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth Gen EPYC Processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances. Exiting first-quarter 2024, AMD had more than 900 public cloud instances available, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft increasing their usage of fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, Meta, Oracle and other cloud providers announced further MI300X deployments in the reported quarter. However, weakness in the Gaming and the Embedded businesses remains a headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on AMD here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of PepsiCo have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the year-to-date period (+6.9% vs. +5.7%). Strength and resilience in core categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends are helping it to outpace the industry.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PEP\u2019s international business continues to hallmark its overall performance, delivering significant volume and organic revenue growth in the first quarter. These factors along with robust pricing aided PepsiCo\u2019s earnings and organic revenues first-quarter 2024.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo\u2019s productivity and cost-management initiatives bode well. For 2024, PEP expects to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 4%. However, the company witnessed soft sales trends in the QFNA segment due to recent product recalls. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here >>>)\r\n\r\nSAP\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+77.0% vs. +46.8%). The company\u2019s performance is benefiting from strengthening cloud business, especially robust demand for the Rise with SAP and Grow with SAP solutions. We expect non-IFRS cloud revenues to be up 24.6% in 2024.\r\n\r\nMomentum in its business technology platform along with proliferation of generative AI bodes well. It is now focusing more on vital strategic growth areas, especially Business AI, and position the company for future growth. Management also reaffirmed its guidance for 2024 cloud revenues along with 2025 long-term targets including cloud and total revenues.\r\n\r\nHowever, continued softness in the Software license and support business segment along with uncertainty prevailing over global macroeconomic conditions continues to remain concerns for SAP. Rising costs are likely to put pressure on margin performance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on SAP here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of FitLife Brands have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+65.7% vs. +0.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $127.6 million has seen strong revenue growth, notably after acquiring Mimi's Rock Corp., boosting yearly revenues by 83% in 2023. Online sales have surged 309%, aligning with e-commerce trends and evolving consumer habits.\r\n\r\nFinancial health is robust, with debt reduced through proactive payments. The acquisition of MusclePharm adds well-known products, boosting the diverse portfolio, although integration poses risks. Cost efficiencies from mergers, especially in advertising, bolster profitability.\r\n\r\nFitLife\u2019s market position benefits from the growing nutritional supplement industry but faces challenges like high debt levels, reliance on GNC, and market competitiveness. Regulatory compliance and market dynamics pose additional risks, with reliance on acquisitions and online sales presenting potential volatility and integration challenges.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on FitLife Brands here >>>)\r\n\r\nNational Presto\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry over the past year (+12.2% vs. +11.6%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $568.38 million maintains a strong financial position with $63.5 million in cash and low debt levels, enhancing its ability to invest and return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\r\n\r\nIts diversified revenue streams from Housewares/Small Appliances, Defense, and Safety segments provide stability and reduce market risk. The Defense segment, generating $55 million in first-quarter 2024 net sales, boasts a substantial $692.6 million backlog, positioning the company for growth. Strategic positioning in high-growth markets, including defense and smart kitchen appliances, further bolsters its long-term potential.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing inventory levels raise concerns about demand forecasting, and heavy reliance on defense contracts exposes it to government spending changes.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) provided a significant update Monday on its long-in-the-tooth project to develop electric semitrucks, which has experienced a series of delays since CEO Elon Musk debuted the rig back in 2017.\n\nThe company confirmed its Tesla Semi remains on track for production-spec deliveries to customers by 2026 while offering more details on range and payload capacity for the EV truck.\n\nSpeaking at the Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo in Las Vegas, Tesla exec Dan Priestley said, \"We're building a factory in Nevada that is being ramped in 2026 for customer deliveries and ramping to eventual target capacity to 50,000 units a year.\"\n\nCurrently, the Tesla Semi is in pilot testing with PepsiCo\u2019s FritoLay division. Priestley said PepsiCo would be receiving an additional 50 trucks in its fleet for the pilot program. The company is currently testing approximately 35 trucks.\n\nTesla stock rose as much as 4.5% on Tuesday.\n\nIn his presentation, Priestley said the company's long-range Semi would have a range of up to 500 miles with a 23,000-lb vehicle weight.\n\nIts standard-range truck would be capable of 300-mile trips with an unladen 20,000-lb vehicle weight.\n\nIn real-world testing with Pepsico, Tesla Semis performed long-range runs of 250 and 520 miles with a gross vehicle weight including cargo of up to 82,000 lbs, the maximum allowed by law. Tesla Semi at the FritoLay Facility in Modesto, Calif. (PepsiCo) (Pepsi)\n\n\"[The trucks] could do more than 1000 miles in a 24-hour period; fast charging enables that,\" Priestley said.\n\nAll told, the Semi test fleet has accumulated 3.5 million test miles, Priestley said, with Tesla also using the Semi to deliver batteries from Nevada to its main plant in Fremont in extreme weather and mountainous regions.\n\nThese new details regarding the Tesla Semi come amid a series of shifts at the company, including a renewed emphasis on the company's robotaxi program, plans to accelerate development of its low-cost Model 2 car, and cuts across the business, notably in its Supercharger unit.\n\nTesla shareholders are also set to vote on Musk's proposed pay package, potentially worth tens of billions, ahead of its June 13 annual meeting.

        "content": "(Reuters) -PepsiCo said on Tuesday it would expand its fleet of electric vehicles in California, deploying 50 Class 8 Tesla Semi trucks and 75 Ford E-Transit electric vans at its facilities in the state over the next several months. The beverage maker said the move would help \"step-change\" the electrification of its equipment services fleet across California as it tries to reach its goal of net zero emissions by 2040.\n\nPepsiCo first placed an order for 100 Tesla Semis in 2017, making it the biggest public order for the vehicles at the time.\n\nHowever, Reuters reported in April that Pepsi was using only 36 of the 100 trucks ordered, disclosing a shortfall in the delivery of the trucks.\n\nThe Tesla semi trucks announced today will operate from its Fresno, California manufacturing facility.\n\nPepsi said it is partly funding the expansion with a grant provided by the California Air Resources Board, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, and the California Energy Commission.\n\n(Reporting by Juveria Tabassum; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Reliable Blue-Chip Stocks That Cannot Miss",
        "content": "If you\u2019re on the hunt for reliable blue-chip stocks to buy this month, look no further. Reliability is one of the most important factors when creating a winning investment strategy. One of the easiest ways to ensure reliability is by investing in blue-chip stocks. Blue-chip stocks represent well established companies with long track records of success. They often have a long history of reliable earnings and many times pay dividends. In short, they are among the most reliable investments available.\n\nIn general, what an investor gains in reliability by investing in blue-chip stocks, they lose in potential returns. All I\u2019m saying here is that these firms are generally past their highest growth stages. Yes, you may be able to find faster growing firms but on average blue-chip stocks are going to win much more often.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) is the holding company anchored by Google which is itself anchored by its Google search business. Google search is again very strong which is very good news for the stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors need simply look at the company\u2019s first quarter earnings report in order to understand why Alphabet continues to be a strong investment. Google search revenues surged above $46 billion during the period. So too did YouTube ad revenue leading to strong increases in overall ad revenue for Google. Cloud growth was also impressive and overall revenues jumped from $69 billion a year ago to over $80 billion this quarter.\n\nThe stock also recently began paying dividends to investors. That\u2019s one of the surest signs of overall stability in any company. Google pays an additional 20 cents for each share of stock owned. Silicon Valley\u2019s Tech Giants are beginning to pay dividends and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they compete against one another in that regard. Growth is still the primary concern for tech companies but the Blue Chips like Google are also beginning to offer the reliability of quarterly income.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors should expect Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to perform very well in the coming months. Firstly, concerns around inflation are again easing following the April jobs report. It\u2019s entirely likely that two rate cuts may still occur in 2024. That will pull Amazon and all of the stock market higher, particularly growth oriented tech.\n\nMore importantly, Amazon\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) efforts are coming into sharper focus. Recent news suggests that pressure is on in that regard. Jeff Bezos recently emailed Amazon executives prompting them to up AI efforts at the firm.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the company hasn\u2019t already invested in artificial intelligence \u2013 it has. The company recently concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic, one of the most important AI upstarts.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think any of the big tech companies feel secure in their AI efforts at this stage. Each must be worried that critical errors have been made; that\u2019s just the nature of investing in totally new technology.\n\nRemember, Amazon beat earnings by nearly 18% in the first quarter. It\u2019s as strong a company as ever.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: Walmart (WMT) Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) tends to be fairly steady across the economic cycle. the company can usually find a way to thrive no matter the macro environment. That is again proving true per first quarter earnings.\n\nConsumers are well aware that the cost of eating out has become prohibitively expensive in some cases. That\u2019s a boon to Walmart\u2019s grocery business, the largest grocer overall. Consumers are balking on restaurant eating and instead flocking to Walmart to buy ingredients for meal preparation. That\u2019s one of the takeaways from Walmart\u2019s strong first quarter earnings which came in better than expected.\n\nThe return to thriftiness is evidence across the economy. Other important firms including McDonald\u2019s see strong consumer demand for value options. The company is reintroducing its $5 meal deal this summer.\n\nThat is another strong sign for discount retailers including Walmart which dominates the space. The American consumer looks to be shifting toward value again and Walmart, as we know, offers great value.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who follow MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI)\u00a0stock have become accustomed to an incredible pace of growth. The fintech payments and e-commerce powerhouse of Latin America continues that streak today and is one of the best Blue Chips to buy.\n\nMercadoLibre operates in 18 Latin American countries across five business divisions. Those divisions include A Marketplace, a payments division called Mercado pago, Personalized media division, Mercado shops, and a credit card business.\n\nThose businesses continue to grow at very rapid rates proven by the fact that Q1 net profits increased by 71%. MercadoLibre\u2019s\u00a0 success stems from its continued commitment to bring e-commerce and payments to what was traditionally an underserved Latin American market. The area isn\u2019t growing by population but the opportunity remains large due to how traditionally underserved the area has been.\n\nFor investors who are worried that MercadoLibre shares are overpriced, consider that this metrics-based website believes they\u2019re actually worth $150 more.\n\nReliable Blue-Chip Stocks: PepsiCo (PEP) PepsiCo building in Russia. PEP stock.\n\nSource: 8ED8 / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) is a snacks and beverages giant that offers a can\u2019t miss stock for investors. It\u2019s become evident throughout this inflationary period that consumers will remain loyal to the company despite higher prices. Another way of putting that is to say that PepsiCo benefits from strong pricing power. Even as volumes fall the company manages to increase revenues through higher prices.\n\nThat\u2019s the power of having strong brands within your portfolio which is very true of Pepsi. The company\u2019s North American beverages business and its North American snacks business are the primary drivers of success. Fortunately, both continue to grow on the top line basis, again despite lower volumes.\n\nPepsi gave guidance for 4% Revenue growth throughout 2024, reiterating previous guidance. That\u2019s indicative of stability and predictability which is the hallmark of blue-chip stocks. The company also expects earnings to increase by 8% in 2024. Earnings growth in excess of revenue growth is a strong sign that the company will continue to reward shareholders.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is probably the best stock for a conservative investor seeking reliable exposure to the chip sector. Other shares like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) offer greater potential for outsized gains. Taiwan Semiconductor is their supplier and provides chips to the vast majority of so-called chip companies.\n\nI assume some investors must be worried about the general threats facing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing at this point. The threat of a Chinese invasion is one of those as is the continued onshoring threat from the United States.\n\nWell, if China ultimately invades Taiwan the results will be catastrophic for companies everywhere. There\u2019s little that can be done to protect the company in that regard. It\u2019s simply an unavoidable risk. The onshoring threat is a different story. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is heavily invested in U.S. efforts and is building foundries in Arizona. The point here is that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing provides the majority of the world\u2019s semiconductors and despite any perceived risks is still among reliable blue-chip stocks to buy for that reason.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Amgen Inc (AMGN).\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmgen (NYSE:AMGN) is one of the best pharmaceutical stocks to consider at the moment. The weight loss drug opportunity is the primary reason.\n\nAmgen is a blue chip stock and a member of the Dow. It\u2019s generally seen as a reliable investment overall. However, another catalyst is currently emerging that makes Amgen an even stronger investment at the moment.\n\nThe company is one of the main challengers to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), who currently dominate the weight loss drug space. Amgen\u2019s Answer to Wegovy and Mounjaro is a weight loss drug called MariTide. The drug requires fewer injections and may lead to longer term weight loss than the current alternatives.\n\nAmgen is one of the largest drug manufacturers globally. The point here is that the company is likely capable of garnering the manufacturing resources required to produce such high demand drugs. There\u2019s a reasonable argument to be made that Amgen is the pharma stock that best blends stability and high upside at the moment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Sour Patch Kids Oreos? Peeps Pepsi? What's behind the weird flavors popping up on store shelves",
        "content": "Van Leeuwen Ice Cream usually draws customers with gourmet takes on classics like vanilla and pistachio. But occasionally, the artisanal ice cream maker headquartered in New York slips in what it calls a \u201cshock flavor,\u201d like Hidden Valley Ranch or pizza.\n\nSurprising flavor combinations \u2013 think gravy-flavored Jones Soda or Sour Patch Kids Oreos -- are showing up more frequently in grocery stores and restaurant chains. Hershey recently introduced pink lemonade-flavored Kit Kats, while IHOP and Lay\u2019s brought out Rooty Tooty Fresh n\u2019 Fruity potato chips, designed to taste like strawberry-topped pancakes with a hint of bacon.\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to pass off these limited-time flavors as social media stunts, experts say there\u2019s more to the story. Food companies are responding to the changing and expanding tastes of consumers while also trying to keep brands relevant and distinct to win space on crowded store shelves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a really exciting time of flavor development where consumers are not just one thing. You\u2019re not just a sour lover or a sweet lover. You want a little of this and a little of that,\u201d said Kristen Braun, the senior brand manager for Oreo innovation at Chicago-based food and beverage company Mondelez International. \u201cCompanies are finding the freedom to explore a little bit more and get more creative.\u201d\n\nSour Patch Kids Oreos \u2013 vanilla cream-filled cookies speckled with colorful bites of the sour candies \u2013 are one of about a dozen limited-edition Oreo flavors that Mondelez plans to release this year. Braun said it takes the company one or two years to develop such products, which stay on shelves for about nine weeks. She\u2019s already thinking ahead to future flavors that blur the lines between sweet, salty and spicy.\n\nOddball pairings aren\u2019t entirely new in the food and beverage industry. Hubba Bubba released a bubble gum-flavored soda in the late 1980s, for example. But manufacturers and their suppliers have gotten more sophisticated and efficient, making it easier to experiment and put out limited-editions more frequently, said Mark Lang, a food marketing expert and associate professor of marketing at the University of Tampa.\n\nKyle Shadix, who as the corporate executive research chef for PepsiCo, has worked on beverages like Maple Pepsi and a strawberry shortcake Pepsi sold in Japan, said the members of Generation Z are also fueling innovation. They're diverse, adventurous and pick up on food trends quickly through social media, he said.\n\n\u201cThey're every chef's dream to design for,\u201d said Shadix, who is currently experimenting a lot with Mexican, Korean and Japanese flavors. \u201cGen Z is going to drive us faster. We\u2019re going to start to see even more exploration quicker than in the past because they\u2019re just so open to it.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nToying with flavors can boost brands in several ways. Sometimes they bring new customers to a brand. They might also nudge buyers to pick up the original flavor, Russell Zwanka, director of the food marketing program at Western Michigan University, said.\n\n\u201cSour Patch Oreos sound interesting, but nobody wants to risk buying Oreos that don\u2019t taste good, so people buy both,\u201d Zwanka said.\n\nWhen companies combine brands, they're trying to build an association in consumers' minds. Peeps-flavored Pepsi, which came out last year, sends the message that Pepsi is current and fun, Lang said. Mustard-flavored Skittles, which came out last summer, made the 104-year-old French's brand seem playful.\n\nEnter Kraft Heinz, which approached Van Leeuwen Ice Cream a few years ago about macaroni and cheese-flavored ice cream. Ben Van Leeuwen, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, was doubtful at first but found that Kraft\u2019s powder blended well with the Brooklyn-based company's ice cream.\n\nVan Leeuwen's Kraft Macaroni and Cheese ice cream came out to rave reviews in 2021 and was re-released for a short time last fall.\n\n\u201cWe will only do a shock flavor if we can make it good and distinct. We will not do a shock flavor where it\u2019s just shock in name but taste like vanilla,\u201d Van Leeuwen said.\n\nBut novel flavor combinations don\u2019t always work. Van Leeuwen couldn\u2019t eat more than a few bites of his company\u2019s Hidden Valley Ranch ice cream, which contained onion and garlic powders. And shock flavors typically don\u2019t end up on the permanent menu because of their lower \u201ceat-ability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you would taste our mac and cheese and you\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s good,\u2019 but do you want to take a pint of that mac and cheese from your freezer when you\u2019re watching whatever show on Netflix and eat the entire thing? Probably not,\u201d Van Leeuwen said.\n\nCandy brand Brach\u2019s ran into that issue with its Turkey Dinner Candy Corn, a 2021 limited-edition version of the fall staple that tasted like turkey, stuffing, green beans, cranberry sauce, apple pie and coffee. Katie Duffy, vice president and general manager of seasonal at Ferrara Candy Co., which owns Brach's, acknowledged there was a \u201cgross-out\u201d factor.\n\n\u201cWe have learned from consumers that we don\u2019t want to have something where they eat a few pieces of candy and then they toss it because there\u2019s some things that they don\u2019t want to repeat,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cWe want it to be a delicious flavor journey.\u201d\n\nBrach\u2019s recently introduced Easter Brunch-flavored jelly beans, and they hit that mark, she said. The candy beans mimicked the flavors of blueberry maple pancakes, chocolate doughnuts, caramel cold brew, cinnamon rolls, berry smoothies and mimosa cocktails.\n\nShannon Weiner, senior director of insights and analytics at Ferrara, said the company closely tracks social media to see what flavors are trending. People are increasingly looking for dessert and dairy-flavored candies, she said. They\u2019re also seeking more international flavors like Tajin, a brand of chile-lime spice from Mexico that recently did a collaboration with Pop Tarts.\n\nLang thinks the more time people spend in restaurants or trying out new foods, the more they seek out unusual flavors.\n\n\u201cWe are variety-seeking animals. We constantly are seeking something new and different; it\u2019s in our wiring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe like to experiment.\u201d\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How one company justified a million-dollar logo redesign inspired by the Mona Lisa\u2014and moved just two wavy lines: \u2018Surely this is satire\u2019",
        "content": "The universe\u2019s highest echelon of art contains the following: the golden ratio, reflecting the \u201cdivine\u201d in both nature and mathematics; Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa and the Vetruvian Man, demonstrating the ideal human physiology\u2014and, of course, the Pepsi logo.\n\nAt least, this is the story told by a 27-page design document of a 2008 brand refresh from the beverage juggernaut. In the document, design agency the Arnell Group thoroughly outlined the rationale behind Pepsi\u2019s brand refresh: first establishing the desire to show innovation, then reviewing the evolution of art from Pythagorean \u201cspatial harmonies\u201d to Renaissance art, until deriving the perfect new design that reflects the path of the Sun's light in Earth\u2019s gravitational pull. The final logo would illustrate the \u201cGravitational Pull of Pepsi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pepsi ethos has evolved over time,\u201d the document said. \u201cThe vocabulary of truth and simplicity is a reoccurring phenomena in the brand\u2019s history. It communicates the brand in a timeless manner and with an expression of clarity.\u201d\n\nThe result of the radical rebrand? Pepsi\u2019s same red, white, and blue circular logo, but with its white center stripe undulating at a slightly different angle than its predecessor.\n\nEven 15 years after that change\u2014and a March 2024 global rebranding that returned the white center to its original squiggly shape\u2014the 2008 design document circulates around social media, prompting viral TikToks, do-it-yourself recreations on graphing calculators, and eliciting genuine shock. Piling onto the absurdity of the rationale accompanying Pepsi\u2019s 2008 logo is the redesign\u2019s $1 million price tag.\n\n\u201cSurely this is satire! Pepsi gravitational pull?!\u201d one Reddit user wrote about the 2008 redesign.\n\nAccording to Emily Zugay, a \u201cself-proclaimed\u201d (and university-trained) graphic designer who parodies company logos on her TikTok with 4.3 million followers, Pepsi\u2019s seemingly absurd brand refresh is actually pretty common practice.\n\n\u201cWhen these companies are spending thousands of dollars on these redesigns\u2014even if it's something that could take five minutes\u2014they feel like they need to justify it, even to themselves, sometimes with a document like that: comparing it to the Mona Lisa to show this was worth the money,\u201d she told Fortune.\n\nBut the enduring chatter around Pepsi\u2019s old logo is at the nexus of the company\u2019s modern marketing philosophy, according to Venky Shankar, professor of marketing at Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business who worked with Pepsi to design a global forecast system for the company. The discourse around Pepsi\u2019s previous rebranding may be in jest, but the precipitating business factors and industry trends are very real.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAll brands look for a refresh when their sales are not growing as fast as they expected to,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cIn this case, carbonated beverages, particularly sodas, have been witnessing a downward trend for a very long time, not just the last few years alone.\u201d\n\nPepsi\u2019s 2008 rebrand was no exception: In October that year, two months after the Arnell Group submitted its redesign document to the company, Pepsi reported disappointing earnings due to poor drink sales, a result of a weakened economy, and announced plans to lay off 3,300 workers, about 1.8% of its workforce.\n\nThe impetus for Pepsi\u2019s 2023 redesign is also clear. Despite better-than-expected revenue, sales have been hindered in the U.S. by consumers thrown off by the company\u2019s price increases. Gen Z consumers in particular have also lost their taste for sugary soda, instead preferring healthier fizzy alternatives. Pepsi has tapped rappers like Ice Spice to push its lemon-lime soda and launched a new line of bubly sparkling water in a bid for young consumers. Pepsi\u2019s new logo makes a similar appeal to Gen Z with its retro vibes.\n\n\u201cPepsi has constantly reimagined and reinvented our logo over the years\u2014as a brand that is both timely and timeless we\u2019ve evolved our look and feel just as our fans and consumers have evolved along with us,\u201d the company told Fortune in a statement. \u201cThe visual identity introduced in 2008 has been very successful for us over the past 14 years of the brand. That said, in 2023 we introduced the next era of Pepsi.\u201d\n\nArnell Group did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRebrand stumbles\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s marketing refreshes haven\u2019t always reflected Da Vinci-caliber genius. In tandem with the rollout of its new Pepsi logo in the late aughts, the parent company also refreshed its Tropicana branding. The juice brand, a subsidiary of Pepsi from 1998 to 2021, removed its front-and-center logo in favor of a tall glass of orange juice. Social media, then in its early days, hated the design.\n\n\u201cDo any of these package-design people actually shop for orange juice?\u201d one angry customer wrote over email, the New York Times reported in 2009. \u201cBecause I do, and the new cartons stink.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn't an online uproar that prompted the company to revert back to its original logo shortly after the redesign. It was the 20% sales plummet that followed the month after.\n\nPepsi\u2019s misstep had shared flavors with Coca-Cola\u2019s 1985 \u201cNew Coke,\u201d when the beverage company announced it would change its drink formula for the first time in almost a century. Consumers revolted, leaving 31,600 calls on the company\u2019s hotline, but the anger also cemented Coca-Cola\u2019s stature, according to its blog, as \u201cobviously more than just a soft drink.\u201d\n\nIn fact, plenty of big marketing swings fail to pay off. One of Pepsi\u2019s biggest online blunders came in 2017, when the company aired an ad with protesters laughing and cheering, that concludes with Kendall Jenner passing out a Pepsi can to a police officer. The ad borrowed imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement protesting police brutality and was largely considered tone deaf. The company later apologized, but not before memes of the ad spread widely online.\n\n\u201cPepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly, we missed the mark and apologize,\u201d Pepsi said at the time.\n\nShankar argued corporations walk a fine line with being made fun of online: \u201cIn a consumer product like Pepsi, if people are making too much fun of it and it starts hurting the existing consumers, that could be a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nWas it all worth it?\n\nWhile Pepsi\u2019s 2017 ad generated enough uproar to have negative consequences, the continued fervent meme-ing of Pepsi\u2019s old logo is not likely to be seen as a threat to the company, Shankar said.\n\nDrawing on the old adage of \u201cany publicity is good publicity,\u201d Shankar believed that in the case of a buzzy rebranding, however mocked it is, means good news for Pepsi. Indeed, social media has changed the marketing game as brands lean into the absurdity of Gen Z humor to get more eyes on their products. Twitter memes have resulted in beverages like Josh Cellars wine and Cerveza Cristal beer essentially receiving free marketing. Zugay, the TikToker, has experienced this phenomenon firsthand. Her intentionally shoddy recreations of big-name logos have been reposted and used as social media profile pictures by brands like McDonald\u2019s, Tinder, and the NFL.\n\n\u201cPeople really resonate with that and enjoy that,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it shows that brand isn't untouchable\u2014at least on Tiktok.\u201d\n\nBut for Pepsi in particular\u2014which has waged war with Coca-Cola for decades\u2014brand loyalty may have ratcheted up the clamor around the logo.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people view logos and brands as precious to themselves or they almost feel a sense of ownership over the look of a logo or the brand itself, if they've been a loyal customer for however long,\u201d Zugay said. \u201cPeople, I feel like, are very sensitive when it comes to logos and rebrand specifically.\u201d\n\nPepsi loyalists have already shown that regardless of the reputation the company\u2019s rebrands have, they\u2019ll stay true to their cola of choice. As one Reddit user put it, \u201cWhen I walk down the drink aisle I unfortunately always succumb to pepsi's gravitational pull.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Cheap Consumer Stocks to Buy Now: May 2024",
        "content": "The retail sector can be broadly divided into consumer staples and discretionary. As the name suggests, staples typically imply essential products used by consumers. On the other hand, discretionary implies luxury or non-essential products. Both these segments are a key GDP growth driver for the U.S. economy.\n\nIn general, high interest rates have negatively impacted consumer spending. However, with the prospects of multiple rate cuts in the next 12 to 18 months, it\u2019s a good time to consider cheap consumer stocks to buy. As consumer spending potentially accelerates, companies in the sector are positioned to benefit.\n\nThe focus of this column is on two blue-chip consumer staple ideas and once growth stock that\u2019s from the consumer discretionary segment. If an investor has a portfolio of these stocks with equal weightage, it\u2019s likely to beat index returns over the next 36 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss these cheap consumer stocks to buy and hold for healthy total returns.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria Group (NYSE:MO) stock finally seems to be gaining momentum after an extended period of sideways movement. Year-to-date, MO stock has trended higher by almost 14%. However, the stock remains undervalued at a forward P/E ratio of 9. Additionally, the stock offers a dividend yield of 8.53%.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Altria is in a phase of business portfolio transformation. The company is gradually increasing its focus on the non-smoking product category. However, the smokable segment remains the cash flow driver.\n\nAn important point to note is that Altria has seen a positive impact from business transformation investments. As an example, the company continues gaining market share in the oral tobacco category.\n\nFurther, MO reported a shipment volume of NJOY consumables at 10.9 million units. The retail share of NJOY in the U.S. multi-outlet and convenience channel increased to 4.3%.\n\nTherefore, with positive business metrics, I am optimistic about the long-term outlook for Altria. The valuation gap is a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is another interesting name among consumer stocks to buy. One reason is that the 2.96% dividend yield stock has been sideways for the last 12 months. Valuations look attractive and the factor of relatively subdued growth is the discount on the stock.\n\nFor Q1 2024, PepsiCo reported organic revenue growth of 2.7% on a year-on-year (YOY) basis. For the full year, the company guided for 4% organic growth and 8% growth in earnings per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn important point to note is that PepsiCo reported a total revenue of $92 billion for the last financial year. Of this, $36 billion was from international markets. However, only 12% of revenue was from Asia Pacific and AMESA (Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and South Africa). There is ample scope for growth in these geographies.\n\nThe second point to note is that between 2019 and 2023, PepsiCo reported beverages growth at a CAGR of 7%. For the same period, the food segment growth was 10%. With a well-balanced portfolio of beverages and snacking products, the overall growth outlook is positive.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) stock is among the undervalued consumer stocks to buy. The stock has trended higher by over 45% in the last 12 months. However, a forward P/E ratio of 24 indicates potential for further upside. Additionally, MNSO stock offers a dividend yield of 1.67%, and I expect healthy dividend growth in the coming years.\n\nMiniso recently reported Q1 2024 results and revenue increased by 26% YOY to $515.7 million. Further, adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9%, higher by 200 basis points YOY. The company\u2019s stellar growth was backed by aggressive retail expansion. Miniso ended the quarter with 6,630 stores globally.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Miniso wants to open 900 to 1,100 stores annually between 2024 and 2028. The company expects revenue growth at a CAGR of more than 20% during this period. Therefore, the outlook is positive and there is ample scope for value creation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Fed Mulls Rate Cuts",
        "content": "For quite some time, the concept of dividend stocks to buy encountered a huge obstacle: the consistently robust and outperforming monthly jobs report. However, the latest employment picture for April finally showed a slowdown, which may give the Federal Reserve the cover that it needs.\n\nAfter seeing inflation skyrocket following the Covid-19 disaster, the central bank laid out a plan to restore stability. That involved raising the benchmark interest rate to tame soaring consumer prices. However, with the employment sector continuing to add more nonfarm payrolls to the economy, policymakers couldn\u2019t go dovish. Now that labor has finally cooled somewhat, it\u2019s possible to see such cuts down the line.\n\nIf so, that would be a big lift for passive income providers. Basically, they no longer have to compete with high-yielding government bonds. That decline in competition should then smile on these intriguing dividend stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top big-box retailers in this country, Target (NYSE:TGT) should be on your radar for dividend stocks to buy if the Fed reverses course with its current monetary policy. Should rates come down, that would reduce the burden of borrowing money. In turn, the action could lift sentiment for discretionary purchases. Theoretically, this dynamic should support TGT stock.\n\nAs for the passive income, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 2.73%. That\u2019s noticeably higher than the consumer staple sector\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. As well, the payout ratio comes in at 41.69%, implying confidence in the sustainability of the yield. Further, Target offers 53 years of consecutive annual payout increases, making it a dividend king.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for earnings per share of $9.43 on sales of $107.14 billion. That\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag compared to last year\u2019s results of $8.94 EPS on sales of $107.41 billion. However, the blue-sky revenue target calls for $109.46 billion, which isn\u2019t unreasonable \u2013 especially if rates come down.\n\nAir Products and Chemicals (APD) Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.\n\nSource: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock\n\nBased in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) falls under the specialty chemicals category. Per its public profile, Air Products provides atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases and other related equipment and services. Should rates drop down, the reduced burden of borrowing could spur economic activity. Thus, APD could benefit from a demand increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile waiting for the narrative to pan out, investors can enjoy a forward yield of 2.83%. While that\u2019s only slightly higher than the sector average yield of 2.82%, here\u2019s the thing: Air Products commands 49 years of consecutive payout increases. One more and it\u2019s a dividend king. That\u2019s a status the company absolutely will not give up on.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate EPS of 12.26 on sales of $12.32 billion. Again, it\u2019s a mixed bag, with last year\u2019s results coming in at earnings of $11.51 on revenue of $12.6 billion. However, fiscal 2025\u2019s top line calls for a consensus view of $13.24 billion, thus rewarding the patient. It could be one of the dividend stocks to buy.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nA soft drink giant, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) also manufactures and distributes convenient foods worldwide. Fundamentally, PepsiCo could benefit from the trade-down effect. Given the challenging economic environment, consumers may look for alternative sources of caffeine, as an example. They may eschew going out to pricey coffee shops for Pepsi-labeled products. That could be a sizable boost for PEP stock.\n\nFurther, PEP ranks among the top dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the underlying company offers a forward yield of 3%. That\u2019s well above the consumer staple sector\u2019s average yield of 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio \u2013 while not terrible \u2013 is a bit elevated at 61.31%. Still, the company benefits from 53 years of consecutive dividend increases. It will hold onto that status.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts project that EPS will land at $8.17 on revenue of $94.48 billion. That would be a sizable improvement over last year\u2019s print of earnings of $7.07 per share on sales of $84.9 billion. The company also beat the revenue target for the first quarter, suggesting robust momentum. Thus, it\u2019s one of the dividend stocks to buy.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn integrated energy giant, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) represents one of the top-tier hydrocarbon players. Fundamentally, the world runs on oil. In that regard, XOM benefits from longstanding relevance. Further, on a cynical basis, the geopolitical flashpoints that have sprouted across the world threaten to disrupt energy supply chains. This too could easily send XOM soaring.\n\nFor now, investors can sleep easier at night knowing that Exxon ranks among the top dividend stocks to buy. Presently, it offers a forward yield of 3.22%. While that\u2019s lower than the energy sector\u2019s average yield of 4.24%, here\u2019s the deal: it commands 41 years of consecutive payout increases. Management will surely want to keep this trend going. As well, the payout ratio is only 38.82%.\n\nInterestingly, analysts project EPS to land at $9.16 with a top line of $348.76 billion. That\u2019s disappointing compared to last year\u2019s results of $9.52 EPS on sales of $344.58 billion. However, because of the geopolitics, the blue-sky targets could be on the table; that is, EPS of $11.08 and revenue of $435.21 billion.\n\nBHP Group (BHP) Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nFalling under the basic materials category, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) focuses on industrial metals and mining. Operating as a resource firm, it features multiple business units that cover commodities such as copper, iron ore and coal. In addition, it mines for uranium and gold, both of which offer relevance during this economic cycle. Should rates decline, the possible spurring of business activity could benefit BHP.\n\nEven better, the company ranks among the dividend stocks to buy for those seeking strong passive income. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 5.04%. That\u2019s well above the materials sector\u2019s average yield of 2.82%. Further, the payout ratio comes in at 56.26%, which is reasonable. However, the payout frequency is semiannual, which is something to keep in mind.\n\nPresently, Wall Street analysts rate shares as a consensus moderate buy. However, the average price target comes in at only $53.92, implying some downside risk. However, Jefferies views BHP as a $68 stock, which seems reasonable based on the broader context.\n\nVerizon (VZ) Verizon Retail Location. Verizon delivers wireless, high-capacity fiber optics and 5G communications. VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nOperating in the vast communication services field, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) ranks among the biggest dividend stocks to buy. Specializing in the telecom category, Verizon engages in the provision of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to individual customers, businesses and government entities worldwide. Since it\u2019s such a pertinent industry, Verizon offers some level of insulation, irrespective of monetary policy fluctuations.\n\nHowever, if rates do end up decreasing eventually, that would be good news for VZ stock. That\u2019s because its already robust yield would look even more attractive. Currently, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 6.56%, well above the sector average of 2.62%. Further, the payout ratio is quite reasonable at 56.46%. Just as well, the company features 19 years of consecutive payout increases.\n\nTo be fair, fiscal 2024 is projected to be a somewhat challenging year, with EPS of $4.26 and a top line of $124.73 billion down from last year\u2019s results of earnings of $4.71 per share on sales of $133.97 billion. However, sentiment could start improving in fiscal 2025, with EPS potentially rising to $4.38 on revenue of $127.22 billion.\n\nAs a dividend play, it might be worth picking up during the lull.\n\nBritish American Tobacco (BTI) British American Tobacco logo on a building\n\nSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in London, U.K., British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) technically falls under the broad consumer defensive sector. However, it does arouse controversy for its namesake tobacco business. With global smoking prevalence coming down, BTI might seem an irrelevant idea. However, while the practice may be in decline, it\u2019s not nonexistent. Further, people have gravitated toward alternative methodologies.\n\nWhile traditional tobacco products may be fading in key markets, the vaping or e-cigarette segment is gaining prominence. Here, British American may have an advantage thanks to its economies of scale. It could simply outmuscle smaller competitors. Also, if any regulatory obstacles arise, BTI would have the financial wherewithal to adjust. That can\u2019t be said confidently about small businesses.\n\nAs for the passive income, that\u2019s where the narrative comes alive. Currently, the company offers a forward yield of 9.56%. That\u2019s well above the norm for the consumer staples industry. To be fair, the company only has one year of raising the payout so that\u2019s something to keep in mind. Still, the payout ratio, while elevated, is reasonable for such a big yield at 61.84%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "With the market performing relatively well and many companies posting first-quarter earnings, investors are getting a clearer picture of stocks destined to take off this year. By picking the hottest stocks to buy now, investors can realize serious returns as the surging momentum continues.\n\nThese three stocks are the hottest picks for this May and offer some of the best growth potential through recent short-term advancements and long-term stability. You can be confident that you are making a safe and intelligent buy this month.\n\nLet\u2019s learn more about the reasons behind these stocks\u2019 recent performances. They are stirring up excitement and getting the ball rolling for a hot year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is one of the most exciting fintech companies of recent years. Formerly known as Square, Block has some of the most popular payment processing technology and operates the payment-sharing platform CashApp. While Block is under federal investigation for compliance issues, many expect the company to prevail.\n\nBlock established its goal of higher profit margins and \u201cthe rule of 40, \u201d confirming its position as a profitable company by 2026. To ensure this, Block laid off employees in January until profits rise.\n\nSo far this year, Block is off to a great start. Q1 saw a record quarterly net income of $472 million and gross profit of $2.09 billion. That represents a 22% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Cash App\u2019s gross profit grew by 25% YOY and Square\u2019s by 19%.\n\nClearly, Block is hot, coming from such a promising first quarter. And, it has exciting plans to sustain this momentum. One of Block\u2019s most promising future projects is its continued investments in Bitcoin. Block has incorporated ways for users to buy and convert cash into Bitcoin and saw a gross profit of $80 million from Bitcoin in Q1.\n\nWith the company\u2019s promising performance and continued dedication to improving its profitability and worthiness as a stock, investors should buy and hold with confidence as Block continues to rise in prominence.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is one of the largest beverage companies, and many think of it as the only true rival to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). However, Pepsi has a substantial edge over Coca-Cola because its products and market reach are much more diversified. Pepsi not only has extremely popular beverages but also has a solid foothold in food.\n\nPepsi\u2019s two leading food sellers, Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods, are at the head of its food business. These two companies made up over half of Pepsi\u2019s sales over the last year leading into this quarter. Despite a recall that damaged sales of Quaker products, Pepsi managed a 2.3% net revenue increase and a 6% increase in EPS under GAAP in Q1.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t the first time Pepsi has proven its resilience and ability to overcome challenges while performing exceptionally. PEP maintained a healthy operating margin and has been a consistently growing stock for many years. It thrives with celebrity-endorsed campaigns and innovative product placement at unique events.\n\nTherefore, investors can get PEP while it\u2019s hot and then rest easy as it generates consistent profits for years to come.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the largest companies and best-performing stocks ever, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rarely a bad time to buy. However, this month is another time that investors should consider buying the e-commerce giant.\n\nWith the heavy competition surrounding AI and cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) reigns as the top player, owning over 30% of the market. After collaborating on the proclaimed \u201csuper chip\u201d GB2000 with tech giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AWS has announced an exciting partnership extension between these two behemoths to advance generative AI innovation.\n\nA deal will likely extend and widen AWS\u2019s lead over major competitors like Microsoft and Google. In addition, Amazon continues to make massive investments in AI players like Anthropic, the largest competitor to generative AI giant ChatGPT.\r\nAnd, AMZN continues to dominate on the e-commerce side as well. Net sales increased 13% YOY in the first quarter, and net income increased to $10.4 billion. Operating cash flow jumped by 82% over the trailing twelve months, and Amazon has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forever Stocks: 3 Dividend Kings Reigning Supreme for 50+ Years",
        "content": "When investors are looking for dependable dividend stocks to buy, a crucial first step is to target companies with an established history of success. A look within the prestigious group of stocks known as Dividend Kings offers an excellent starting point. For over half a century (50-plus years), these companies unfailingly increased their dividends annually, navigating various economic downturns and market cycles with incredible resilience.\n\nAs the cornerstone of many income-oriented portfolios, Dividend Kings are known both for their financial soundness and management\u2019s commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. Having proven they can evolve successfully through the times and be held in portfolios for decades, many investors refer to Dividend Kings as \u201cforever stocks.\u201d\n\nTo a certain degree, I am skeptical about this statement, as investors must remain flexible in adjusting their portfolios according to the market\u2019s ever-changing conditions. However, I do believe that the following three Dividend Kings are positioned to keep rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for many decades ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmerican States Water (AWR) A photo of a woman holding a glass of water.\n\nSource: Alina Kruk/Shutterstock.com\n\nAmerican States Water (NYSE:AWR) isn\u2019t just a Dividend King \u2013 it\u2019s the company with the longest annual dividend growth track record in the world. Boasting 69 years of uninterrupted dividend increases, American States Water is the king of Dividend Kings.\n\nThe company\u2019s superior track record of dividend growth owes much to its highly essential business model. The company enjoys remarkable predictability as a water utility providing a critical commodity for residential, commercial, and military needs. By leveraging this indispensable demand for water, American States Water expanded its distribution network and client base over the decades with minimal risks involved.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that this trend is set to be sustained for decades to come. In fact, due to the company\u2019s predictable water consumption patterns, rate increases, and population growth in the areas it serves, consensus estimates over the next five years anticipate earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8% per annum. This should further bolster investor confidence in the stock regarding maintaining its dividend growth track record.\n\nAWR provides a dividend yield 0f 2.2%.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) An image of a tan building corner with a blue \"P&G\" logo, an American flag on a post, and two larger building tops in the background under a dark blue sky.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is another Dividend King with a long track record of dividend increases \u2013 68 consecutive years. The consumer staple giant features a diverse portfolio comprising approximately 80 household-name personal care brands. Among its wide lineup are some of the most well-known names in the market such as Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Crest, Pantene, and Olay, among others.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of their consumable nature, P&G\u2019s products consistently draw steady consumer demand. Further, due to the enduring strength of its brands, the company enjoys robust pricing power even in challenging market conditions. Visit your local supermarket and you\u2019ll notice that P&G\u2019s brands command notably higher prices compared to pre-pandemic levels, surpassing even the above-average inflation rates during this period.\n\nP&G\u2019s latest dividend hike in April was by 7%, increasing the yield to 2.4% and marking a notable acceleration compared to previous years. Additionally, FY2024 is poised to be a year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, supporting the company\u2019s trend of consistently improving financials. Thus, I see PG stock as a top choice among dividend stocks to buy for a reliable and growing income.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a relatively young Dividend King. Boasting 52 years of successive annual dividend increases, PepsiCo joined this elite group of stocks just two years ago. Yet, PepsiCo already appears positioned to expand its track record for more decades to come. Despite its maturity, its extended portfolio of beverages, snacks, and other food products continues to fuel strong organic growth both domestically and internationally.\n\nWith brands such as Pepsi, Lay\u2019s, Doritos, and Quaker enjoying timeless appeal, PepsiCo built strong brand loyalty over the years. Thus, as is the case with P&G, PepsiCo tends to raise its prices at a pace that matches or exceeds inflation levels, scoring robust earnings and dividend growth.\n\nIn fact, PepsiCo has raised its DPS at a 10-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%, a testament to its ability to thrive even with an established brand portfolio. Moving forward, PepsiCo appears to have multiple growth catalysts, particularly in international markets, where its products gain market share by the quarter. Therefore, I find PEP stock and its 3% yield one of the best dividend stocks to buy for reliable income generation prospects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The Consumer Staples group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. Has Lifeway Foods (LWAY) been one of those stocks this year? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Consumer Staples peers, we might be able to answer that question.\n\nLifeway Foods is a member of the Consumer Staples sector. This group includes 191 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #4. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks.

Meanwhile, the Consumer Staples sector has returned an average of 4.9% on a year-to-date basis.

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in PepsiCo (PEP): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nPepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.84, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.84 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 57.9% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for PEP Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEP\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying PepsiCo, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs PEP a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $8.16.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I think as we looked at the decision back then, and certainly as we view it today, one of the key variables was ensuring that we had clear runway on the loan maturity front. And I think the bond transaction did a couple of things when it reinforced the fact that we can run the company with ample liquidity for the foreseeable future, keeping that line of credit close to zero. Second, it really did reinforce to all of our fixed income stakeholders on the unsecured side that Brandywine is committed to the unsecured marketplace. And our hope is as the conditions improve, as the debt mark-to-market becomes positive versus negative, we\u2019ll be able to restore our investment grade rating and that we wind up in a very good position, both from a liquidity and a balance sheet improving standpoint.\n\nSo I think one of the key issues we take a look at is with that liquidity, second was portfolio stability, what is going to be the ongoing consumption of capital. And as we\u2019ve talked with other questions on the call, we have very little rollover going forward and we think a very stable platform. And then when we look at the development pipeline, there\u2019s really very little left to fund.

        "content": "Even if you\u2019re more of a short-term thinker when it comes to investing, it\u2019s still a good idea to put some money into blue-chip stocks that have been around forever and will likely be\u00a0around\u00a0forever into the future.\u00a0Many stocks these days can fizzle out soon, and most of the hot new tech names today\u00a0probably\u00a0won\u2019t stand the test of time like firms that have been steady performers for generations.\u00a0Time is the real boss, and\u00a0not many\u00a0businesses can stay on top indefinitely.\n\nOn the other hand, companies with deep roots and proven staying power are\u00a0very\u00a0unlikely\u00a0to go anywhere in the next 50 to 100 years.\u00a0Their stock prices will\u00a0probably\u00a0keep growing along with the overall economy for years\u00a0to come.\u00a0So, putting a little cash into those reliable old standbys gives your portfolio a solid backbone for the long haul. You\u2019re betting that society and markets will keep chugging ahead century after century.\n\nSo, let\u2019s check out seven of those time-tested blue-chip stocks to buy and hold that could anchor part of your investments for the next 50 years or more. Their track records through good times and\u00a0bad\u00a0says a lot about how they\u2019ve adapted over the decades.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0kicked off\u00a02024 with a\u00a0strong\u00a0first quarter. Revenue rose nearly 2.3%, fueled by robust pricing actions across its portfolio. The snack and beverage giant showed its ability to push through price hikes without significantly denting volumes. Its brands hold considerable pricing power, and consumers are willing to pay\u00a0up\u00a0for marquee offerings like Lays, Doritos and Pepsi Cola.\n\nPepsiCo also benefited from rebounding foot traffic as consumers returned to pre-pandemic routines. However, the stock did underperform, much like many other retail and consumer staples stocks. I think it\u00a0is unlikely to go down from here unless there is a broad downturn, and buying now is likely a good idea before it recovers.\n\nPepsiCo reiterated full-year guidance, calling for 4% revenue growth.\u00a0You should\u00a0also\u00a0watch\u00a0operating margins closely, as the company laps last year\u2019s dramatic cost inflation. PEP estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIt\u2019s a mature company\u00a0you\u00a0should sit back and let it compound for the coming decades.\u00a0The\u00a0dividend yield here is over 3%, and\u00a0it\u00a0is also a Dividend King. It\u2019s definitely one of the top blue-chip stocks you can buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndustrial gas supplier\u00a0Linde (NASDAQ:LIN) delivered another rock-solid quarter. EPS jumped 9.5% year-over-year (YoY) as the company pushed through higher prices. However, revenue declined slightly by 1.14%.\n\nLinde stands apart through its incredible cash generation and operating discipline. Management also provided\u00a0EPS guidance of $15.30 to $15.60 for the period, compared to the consensus earnings per share estimate of $15.41. Thus, I think the stock could continue climbing due to solid earnings growth. Lin EBIT\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company remains a defensive cash flow compounder levered to secular growth drivers like clean energy transition initiatives. LIN Cash flow\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nLinde\u2019s pricing power and cost control should help navigate any potential economic turbulence\u00a0ahead.\n\nChurch & Dwight (CHD) boxes of Arm & Hammer baking soda\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt was a mixed bag for\u00a0Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) in Q1. The consumer products maker posted 5.1% sales growth, exceeding the 4% guidance.\n\nHowever, Church & Dwight\u00a0is swimming\u00a0against stiff currents as consumers\u00a0turn\u00a0increasingly cost-conscious.\u00a0Brands like Arm & Hammer and OxiClean face intensifying private label competition. Still, the metrics were strong in household and personal care categories due to new launches.\n\nThe SPD segment has continued to remain flat and has actually declined in recent quarters. CHD segments\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, new offerings like Arm & Hammer bathroom cleaners (core consumer) and Batiste dry shampoo (specialty) are gaining traction, with consumption up 19% in Q1 and a growing share of 47.5%. That could drive a lot of growth in the future.\n\nThe Hershey Company (HSY) Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden table\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/VG Foto\n\nChocolate maker\u00a0Hershey (NYSE:HSY) enjoyed a delicious first quarter, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The Easter and Valentine\u2019s Day seasons\u00a0delivered a solid sales boost\u00a0as Hershey\u2019s seasonal chocolate offerings flew off shelves.\u00a0Innovations like Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Caramel Cups and strong merchandising support boosted market share.\n\nWithin the core confectionery portfolio,\u00a0Hershey\u00a0appears to be\u00a0gaining pricing traction compared to recent share softness.\u00a0Management expects volume trends to improve throughout the year as consumer elasticities recover from last year\u2019s price hikes.\u00a0Retailers are also granting more display space and promotion support\u00a0after last year\u2019s inventory flow issues. HSY PE\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock itself is down over 25% in one year, but a rebound is underway, and I think buying the stock at a discount now will set you up for juicy gains in the decades ahead.\n\nOperating margins compressed due to high input costs and trade investments.\u00a0However, Hershey remains confident that\u00a0stronger\u00a0productivity savings in the latter half will help offset pressures. It is one of the most discounted blue-chip stocks right now.\n\nCarlisle Companies (CSL)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCarlisle\u00a0Companies\u2019 (NYSE:CSL) sales grew strongly again after slowing\u00a0for a bit, surging an excellent 23% YoY in Q1.\u00a0It\u2019s also encouraging that pricing\u00a0seems to\u00a0be\u00a0holding\u00a0steady despite rising costs across the industry.\n\nWhat I truly admire about Carlisle is its world-class operations relying on the Carlisle Operating System approach. The COS method is\u00a0really\u00a0paying dividends \u2014 the company lowered expenses so much while increasing production that margins jumped over 530 basis points to 24.2%.\u00a0That\u00a0led to earnings growing by 85% per share after adjusting for\u00a0special\u00a0items.\n\nI\u2019m confident\u00a0Carlisle can keep growing revenues and profits by\u00a0strong double-digit\u00a0percentages. Factors like long-awaited roof replacements, a hot housing market and continued refinements should fuel the momentum.\u00a0It seems they\u00a0also have an advantage as others raise prices, too. CSL margins. blue-chip stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nHowever, what excites me most is where they\u2019re taking the company long-term.\u00a0When the CEO outlined the strategy shift towards pure-play building products through strategic deals and integrated offerings, it made a lot of sense.\u00a0The planned MTL buy fits perfectly to strengthen its lead in architectural metals while enhancing value. Selling off Carlisle Interconnect Technologies will\u00a0also\u00a0generate about $2 billion to invest and create even more shareholder wealth.\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) did not have the best quarter, but\u00a0I still think\u00a0it\u2019s a good long-term bet.\u00a0The average daily package volume was down by 3.2%. Revenue came in at\u00a0$21.7 billion, down 5.3% YoY, and missed analyst expectations by $232 million. UPS package volume\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nDespite the decrease in package volume, revenue per package has held up quite well. UPS revenue per package. blue-chip stocks\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe tighter margins did make me pause, though, with operating profits down 31.5% from the previous year.\u00a0The company shed some 5,400 management positions\u00a0but\u00a0it\u00a0wasn\u2019t entirely\u00a0offset.\u00a0Still, as pricing moves take hold, I expect\u00a0to see expenses\u00a0turn around sharply.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best dividend stocks that are undervalued and have just raised their payouts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend and value stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued Stocks That Just Raised Their Dividends.\n\nDividend stocks didn\u2019t perform well in 2023. However, this apparent setback has actually created favorable opportunities for long-term investors to identify undervalued stocks. Analysts also suggest piling into undervalued equities as these stocks have the potential to offer higher returns in the long run. Morningstar Chief US Market Strategist David Sekera also highlighted the same investment strategy in his second-quarter 2024 stock market outlook. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cIn our view, it is unlikely that what has worked for the last year and a half will be what continues to work. \u00a0We think now is a good time for investors to look for contrarian investment opportunities, especially in those areas that have underperformed, are unloved\u2014and most importantly\u2014undervalued.\u201d\n\nUndervalued stocks are those that are trading below their intrinsic value. This means that the market price of these stocks does not truly reflect their worth. Investing in undervalued dividend stocks can be a good opportunity for investors as these equities provide a steady income stream even if the stock price doesn\u2019t immediately appreciate. In addition to this, value stocks have shown strong performance over growth stocks over time. Studies conducted by Josef Lakonishok, a former finance professor at the University of Illinois, and David Dreman, a renowned expert in value investing, have highlighted that value stocks typically offer higher dividend yields and exhibit stronger fundamental ratios compared to high-flying growth stocks, as we reported in our article 30 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts. Their research indicated that value investing outpaces growth around 70% of the time, irrespective of the companies\u2019 sizes. Across different company sizes, their analysis consistently demonstrated that value stocks yield average returns of a little over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.\n\nDespite the underperformance of dividend stocks in 2023, companies worldwide are steadily raising their dividend payouts as a strategy to draw investor interest. Global dividend growth has consistently shown an upward trend over the past years, especially after the pandemic of 2020. According to a report by Janus Henderson Investors, global dividends grew from $1.24 trillion in 2017 to $1.66 trillion in 2023. Moreover, the figure is expected to reach $1.72 trillion this year. The dividend outlook for European companies is also promising, as they are expected to distribute \u20ac620 billion ($667 billion) to shareholders this year, marking a decade-high level of returns, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbbVie Inc.

        "title": "5 Safe Stocks to Buy as Consumer Sentiment Hits 6-Month Low",
        "content": "Rising inflation is igniting fresh fears of an economic slowdown, as the upbeat sentiment among millions of Americans continues to fade fast. Consumers who were confident about the economy\u2019s health till a few months back are now doubtful about the future.\n\nThe University of Michigan\u2019s preliminary reading on the overall consumer sentiment index came up with a reading of 67.4 for May, its lowest level in six months. Also, this was sharply lower than April\u2019s reading of 77.2 and the consensus estimate of 76.\n\nThis reflects a 12.7% month-over-month and 14.2% year-over-year decline in consumer sentiment.\n\nThe one-year outlook for inflation climbed to 3.5% in May, increasing 0.3% month over month. Also, the five-year outlook for inflation rose 0.1% to 3.1% in May.\n\nThe current condition index dropped over 10 points to 68.8 in May. The expectations index slipped to 66.5%, declining 9.5%.\n\nEconomic growth slowed in the first quarter, increasing a modest 1.6%, sharply lower than the consensus estimate of 2.2%, and after increasing 3.5% in the final quarter of 2023.\n\nInflation, which had been declining sharply till December 2023, thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s strict monetary tightening campaign, has once again started its ascent.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% in March, which has raised concerns among investors as they fear that the Federal Reserve could further delay its planned rate cuts. The Fed also said that it doesn\u2019t see any signs of inflation declining sharply and its 2% target is still a far cry.\n\nRising inflation presently remains the biggest concern leading to delay rate cuts, which could keep markets volatile for a longer period.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this situation, it would thus be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples like California Water Service Group CWT, National Grid plc NGG, Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PNW, Colgate-Palmolive Company CL and PepsiCo, Inc.

        "content": "BENGALURU, May 13 (Reuters) - Varun Beverages reported its first-quarter earnings above market expectations on Monday, as the Pepsi India bottler benefited from an uptick in demand for soft drinks due to an early onset of summer.\n\nGurugram-based Varun Beverages' consolidated net profit rose to 5.37 billion rupees ($64.3 million) for the quarter ended March 31, from 4.29 billion rupees in the year-ago period.

These stocks represent companies that regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders.\n\nThe appeal lies in the ability to receive passive income in the form of cash payments on top of potential share price appreciation. While the allure of finding the following big growth stock is strong, dividend stocks provide investors with an unmatched sense of stability. As you hunt for the best income stocks to buy, it is crucial to consider that a high yield alone will not yield the best results.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the best dividend stocks to buy in May 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

        "title": "The 3 Best Energy Drink Stocks to Own to Fuel Your Finances",
        "content": "The best energy drink stocks to own are positioned to benefit from changing consumer trends and booming demand for caffeinated beverages. While coffee remains a popular caffeinated drink, energy drinks are growing at a much faster clip. The global coffee market is only expected to expand by 0.9% annually through 2025. But the energy drink market is forecast to grow by 1.4% annually over the same period. This presents a big opportunity for investors.\n\nRed Bull is not included among the energy drink stocks listed in this article because it is a private company. We instead focus on three appealing publicly traded stocks with exposure to the high-growth energy drink category.\n\nRising health consciousness among Millennials and Gen Z has fueled demand for fortified energy drinks. These are often packed with vitamins, herbs and functional ingredients like caffeine. The mega caffeine boost provided by energy drinks also appeals greatly to this demographic. Major distribution gains for brands like Monster, Rockstar and Celsius have put energy drinks in more stores, making buying convenient. With several catalysts driving continued expansion ahead, energy drink stocks stand out as an attractive investment theme. The companies covered below boast impressive growth trajectories. This makes them some of the best energy drink stocks to own to capitalize on the surging consumption.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith over 37% of the global dedicated energy drink market share, Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) continues to strengthen its position as an industry leader. Net sales grew 11.8% year-over-year in Q1 2024 to reach a record $1.90 billion. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales were actually up 15.6% (12.6% without Argentina impact). Gross profit as a percentage of net sales also rose significantly to 54.1% in Q1 2024. In Q1 2023, it hit 52.8%.\n\nMonster Beverage\u2019s consistent double-digit growth has fueled its stock price appreciation over decades. In fact, Monster\u2019s stock performance over the past 30 years makes it the single best-performing stock out of the entire S&P 500 during that stretch \u2013 yes, even better than Apple or Amazon over the same timeframe.\n\nWith strong continued revenue growth projected at 10% annually over the next five years along with strategic international expansion and acquisition initiatives underway, Monster Beverage remains well-positioned for future success. MNST stands out as one of the best energy drink stocks to own for investors who want long-term gains.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is one of the best energy drink stocks to own thanks to its rapid growth and immense potential. CELH offers healthy, sugar-free energy drinks made with quality ingredients and no artificial flavors. Celsius\u2019s annual sales exploded from $75.1 million in 2019 to over $1.3 billion in 2023.\n\nThe key driver behind Celsius\u2019s incredible revenue growth is expanding distribution. Their international distribution currently only accounts for a small percentage of sales but has been expanding. In 2023, Celsius signed an agreement with PepsiCo for distribution in Canada. It also entered a deal with Suntory Beverage & Food to distribute in the UK and Ireland. These deals pave the way for accelerated international expansion. Domestically, Celsius sells its drinks in over 174,000 retail locations across major chains like Walmart and 7-Eleven.\n\nWall Street continues to be bullish on Celsius, projecting revenue to double to $2.49 billion by 2025. The company just secured a high-profile global sponsorship deal with Scuderia Ferrari Formula One racing team as well. With sales surging, new distribution channels opening internationally, and increased brand visibility, Celsius Holdings is one of the best energy drink stocks to own.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is certainly one of the best energy drink stocks to own right now. With over $91 billion in net revenue in 2023 and 14% growth in core constant currency earnings per share, PepsiCo shows that it is a strong and growing company.\n\nA key driver of PepsiCo\u2019s growth in the energy drink space is its 2020 $3.85 billion acquisition of Rockstar Energy. In addition, PepsiCo continues to invest significantly in other energy drink brands like Celsius. These moves have expanded PepsiCo\u2019s presence in the fast-growing energy drink industry.\n\nThe energy drink moves also leverage PepsiCo\u2019s overall size, stability and staying power as a blue chip stock. So PEP offers a less risky way to bet on the energy drink boom compared to investing directly in smaller, less diversified energy drink pure plays.\n\nIn 2023, PepsiCo held or gained market share in over half of its key global beverage and convenience food markets. So its core business remains extremely strong. When one combines steady core growth with big energy drink investments, it\u2019s clear PepsiCo has what it takes to energize portfolios for years to come.\n\nFor investors looking to add an energy drink stock with size, stability and serious growth potential to their portfolio, PEP perfectly fits the bill. Its recent results and smart energy drink investments cement its status as one of the best energy drink stocks to own now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The stock market has performed well so far this year, with benchmark indices rising over 9%. After recovering from a dip in April, indices are nearing record highs set in March and could soon score new records. While past performance is positive, high valuations have reignited discussions around a potential market correction. The S&P 500\u2018s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is close to 27, above its 10-year median of 15. This suggests the market may be indeed overvalued and due for a pullback.\r\n\r\nSome investors choose to opt for more defensive plays in such conditions, focusing on reliable dividend stocks. Others seek a \u201cset and forget\u201d approach, generating steady returns through reliable dividend stocks without worrying about short-term market fluctuations. Either way, steady dividend plays require finding reliable dividend stocks that feature companies that have consistently raised dividends.\n\nOver the past five years, over 50 US companies raised dividends yearly. However, there are reliable dividend stocks that not only meet the exact 5-year criteria but have been around for much longer. Some long-established dividend payers have also recently increased payouts, making them more reliable candidates, could continue doing so at adequate levels even if markets experience turbulence.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ Stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a leading healthcare company with a proven record of increasing dividends. It has raised them for 61 consecutive years, earning the designation of being a \u2018dividend king\u2019. Last year, the company increased its dividend by 4.2% and provided a solid forward yield of 3.3%. With a good payout ratio of 64%, Johnson & Johnson is one of the reliable dividend stocks that simply offers investors a reliable return. While dividend growth has slowed in recent years following the spin-off of the consumer health unit, the company shifted focus to increased growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHealthcare services remain in demand, as the need for medicine and treatment exists regardless of economic or stock market conditions. As one of the largest corporations in America with an established history and a healthcare segment that continually delivers sound results, Johnson & Johnson can be expected to maintain dividend rises in the foreseeable future, barring any major financial issues.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nConsumer staples company PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) has managed steady growth despite high inflation. It appears that higher prices have not diminished the demand for comfort foods and snacks. The company reported solid earnings for the year\u2019s first quarter and continued its 51-year tradition of raising dividends. It increased its dividend to $1.355 per share, representing a 7% rise year-on-year (YOY) and a forward dividend yield of 3.04%. Its payout ratio is somewhat higher than comparable firms, distributing over 74% of profits to investors.\r\n\r\nThe consumer staples segment may see a boost should economic growth take off. Despite the uncertainty, PepsiCo can still deliver dividend growth as it did during the subprime crisis. Assuming an average dividend growth rate of 7.3% yearly, PepsiCo will remain one of the reliable dividend stocks for years to come. PepsiCo is expected to double its dividends every ten years. Current projections show a 2024 increase from $4.945 to $5.3 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthern Company (SOLN) the southern company logo displayed several times on a screen\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, a utility company would be part of a list of reliable dividend stocks. Southern Company (NYSE:SOLN) has consistently provided stable dividend payments. However, it is not classified as a \u2018dividend king\u2019 solely because its current configuration has not existed long enough. Tracing back to 1924, Southern Company\u2019s holding structure was established in 2001 following the spin-off of Southern Energy. Since then, it has raised dividend payments to shareholders yearly. It did so through economic downturns,\u00a0 the \u201cgreat recession\u201d notwithstanding.\n\nThe company recently hiked dividend payouts to investors by 2.9%, totaling $2.88 per share annually. This provides a yield of 3.8%, above the industry average of 2.5%. Southern Company\u2019s higher yield results from allocating 71% of earnings to rewarding shareholders, indicating a prioritization of dividend income. The next payout is expected to occur on June 6 at 72 cents per share from 70 cents paid on March 6. Assuming a continuation of reporting positive net income, as it has done over the past ten years, the company could raise its dividend once again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "UPS CFO Brian Newman is departing. But the firm\u2019s CEO is a finance veteran who helped Home Depot survive",
        "content": "Good morning. A delivery giant is searching for a new CFO.\n\nUPS (no. 37 on the Fortune 500) announced on Monday that Brian Newman, CFO since 2019, will leave the company on June 1, for medical reasons.\n\n\u201cI am honored to have served as CFO of such a storied company with so many great leaders around the world,\u201d Newman said in a statement. \u201cI am confident in the company\u2019s continued success and growth trajectory. My near-term priority is to focus on my health.\u201d\n\nBefore joining UPS, Newman spent 26 years with PepsiCo serving in finance leadership roles such as EVP for PepsiCo\u2019s Global Operations, and launching initiatives like PepsiCo\u2019s global e-commerce business. Newman, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Ireland, began his career as an investment banker working for PaineWebber in New York City.\n\nUPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said in a statement that Newman has been \u201ca great partner\" and helped to guide the company through unprecedented economic conditions. She added that Newman has left the company \u201cwell-positioned\" as UPS continues to implement its \"1+2 strategy,\" focusing on sales and profit growth and increasing operating margins.\n\nUPS said in the announcement that they will evaluate internal and external CFO candidates to replace Newman. The new finance chief will become the strategic partner to Tom\u00e9, who is a former longtime CFO. Before UPS, she had spent nearly 25 years at Home Depot, where she held the CFO title for 18 years.\n\nTom\u00e9 retired as CFO of Home Depot in 2019, keeping the board seat she has held at UPS since 2003. But in 2020 as the pandemic raged, she came out of retirement to run UPS as the first woman CEO in the company's history. The move gave the company a powerhouse chief executive, who earned a spot on Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women list.\n\nDuring her tenure as CFO at Home Depot, Tom\u00e9 is credited with helping to deliver a 450% increase in the company's shareholder value, and guiding the company through the 2008 recession.\u00a0\u201cI learned that the answer to really all of the strategic questions facing a company can be found by listening,\u201d Tom\u00e9 told Fortune in 2020. \u201cIn my free time, in the evenings, on the weekends, I would put on an apron and work in [Home Depot] stores.\u201d\n\nSo Tom\u00e9\u2019 will seemingly play a major role in the UPS search for a new CFO. \u201cHaving former CFOs on the board is a huge asset whether or not a company needs a new CFO,\u201d Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of Cowen Partners, a C-suite-focused executive search firm, told me.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a potential drawback. \u201cFormer CFOs have a habit of emulating themselves,\u201d Cole said. That could be counterproductive if it doesn\u2019t fit the CFO candidate profile the company requires, he said. Having an open mind is key, Cole said.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhoever is chosen as the next CFO of UPS will have much work to do. The delivery giant released its first-quarter earnings report on April 23, and the company\u2019s \u201coverall performance was in line with our expectations,\u201d Newman said in a recent LinkedIn post. Revenue was $21.7 billion, down 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Profits for the quarter were $1.43 per share, down 35% below the same period last year.\n\nThe company narrowly avoided a labor strike last year by brokering a contract that gave UPS workers higher wages and improved working conditions. (In the first quarter of 2023, prior to union negotiations, revenue crossed $100 billion for the first time since its founding.) UPS plans to cut 12,000 mostly management positions. By 2026, the company aims to grow revenue to between $108 million and $114 billion, and an operating margin above 13%. It recently won a significant contract with the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n\u201cAfter coming off a difficult market in 2023, the small package industry is poised to return to growth in 2024 and beyond,\u201d Tom\u00e9 said in a statement in March regarding the company\u2019s strategic initiatives.\n\nUPS has ambitious financial goals in a turbulent economy, and a highly competitive space, Cole said. In his assessment, the CFO must have \u201can ambitious personality, be a strong leader, and management, including the CEO, needs to be comfortable with said profile,\u201d he said.\n\nBringing in a finance chief of another Fortune 50 distributed service business, with a large unionized workforce, who has a strong finance background including financial planning and analysis is \"the direction I would go,\u201d Cole added.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nUpcoming event: Fortune\u2018s Future of Finance event in New York City will take place on May 16. It\u2019s going to be a unique opportunity to explore with top players how technology is set to transform finance.\u00a0You can learn more about it and apply to attend here; email FutureFinance@Fortune.com with inquiries.\n\nMar\u00eda Soledad Davila Calero curated the Leaderboard and Overheard sections of today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "VDC: Strong and Steady Consumer Staples ETF",
        "content": "Whether it\u2019s Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Hershey (NYSE:HSY), Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), or Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), consumer staples stocks are reporting strong earnings, and they look like steady, reliable performers for the long haul during a time of market volatility.\n\nThe Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC) is a major consumer staples ETF that allows investors to gain diversified exposure to a broad range of these steady-eddy blue-chip stocks.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on VDC based on the reliable revenue and earnings of its holdings, the persistent demand for the products these holdings sell, and the ETF\u2019s strong performance amid a volatile market. I\u2019m also bullish on VDC based on its low fee, long dividend history, and the strong Smart Scores its top holdings boast.\n\nWhat Is the VDC ETF\u2019s Strategy?\n\nVDC was launched by index fund pioneer Vanguard more than 20 years ago, in January 2004. In that time, the fund has grown to $6.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Vanguard, VDC \u201cseeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the consumer staples sector.\u201d\n\nVDC\u2019s underlying index \u201cincludes stocks of companies that provide direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer spending habits, are considered nondiscretionary.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll get into what types of stocks this encompasses in the section below.\n\nVDC\u2019s Top Holdings are Holding Up\n\nVDC owns 105 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.7% of the fund.\u00a0Below, you\u2019ll find an overview of VDC\u2019s top 10 holdings from TipRanks\u2019 holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, VDC owns a group of high-profile, blue-chip U.S. consumer staples stocks.\n\nThe fund owns the makers of everyday household staples like detergents, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, and more, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive. These companies may not sound like the most exciting in the world, but they sell products that people need every day and are loath to cut from their budgets. This puts them in a strong position no matter how the economic tides ebb and flow from one day to the next.\n\nColgate recently shook off inflation and economic uncertainty to report strong 9.8% organic sales growth for the first quarter and increased pricing of 8.5%, encapsulating the strength these consumer staples stalwarts have in this environment. Colgate also used the strong start to the year as an opportunity to increase revenue guidance for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, VDC has positions in soft drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), which sell the sodas and other drinks that many people consume on a daily basis, regardless of how the macro economy is doing or where interest rates stand.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Colgate, Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and overcame any macroeconomic challenges, beating on both revenue and earnings. Coca-Cola says that it expects to grow organic revenue by an impressive 8-9% this year, along with comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 11% to 13%.\n\nTobacco stocks like Philip Morris and Altria (NYSE:MO) are in a similarly strong position, as tobacco users buy their products on a routine, habitual basis and are unlikely to eschew this habit just because the economy is slow. Inflation and the uncertain economy aren\u2019t hurting demand for Philip Morris\u2019 red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.\n\nBig box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.\n\nLastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.\n\nOther notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%.\n\nAs these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC\u2019s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\u00a0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nEight out of VDC\u2019s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nLong Dividend History\n\nWhether it\u2019s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC\u2019s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it\u2019s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.\n\nVDC currently yields 2.5%. While it\u2019s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%. Plus, VDC has a reliable track record as a dividend payer, having made dividend payments to its holders for 18 years in a row.\n\nAffordable Expense Ratio\n\nLike many of its Vanguard peers, it features a modest expense ratio of just 0.10% (a 0.09% management fee plus 0.01% in other expenses). This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.\n\nOver time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.\n\nHow does this help investors to save? Let\u2019s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.\n\nBelow, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks\u2019 ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.\n\nIs VDC Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Sound Choice\n\nI\u2019m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it\u2019s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.\n\nThroughout earnings season, we\u2019ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.\n\nI\u2019m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings\u2019 strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tried and True Dividend Stocks to Buy for Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Picking income stocks can be challenging. Some companies pay dividends only to cut them in the future, and others are more focused on\u00a0stock buybacks instead of dividends. However, research has shown that dividends provide investors with about 35% of their total returns over time. It varies year to year, but holding solid income stocks that consistently raise their annual payout has proven successful.\n\nThe three dividend stocks to buy below have prioritized returning cash to shareholders and all have excellent long-term growth prospects. Dive in now!\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular income and dividend growth stock. It is the No. 2 player in non-alcoholic beverages and is the market leader in salty snacks. The firm competes in almost every non-alcoholic beverage segment with many brands. It is known for drinks such as Pepsi, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, 7Up, Aquafina, Lipton, SodaStream, and more. Besides beverages, PepsiCo is the global leader in chips with brands like Lays, Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos. The firm also owns Quaker Foods. The result is a diversified product line reaching $91.47 billion in revenue in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo is a favorite equity when it comes to income. It is a Dividend King with a 52-year streak of yearly increases. It last raised its dividend in May 2023. Investors should expect another increase next month. According to Portfolio Insight, the dividend growth rate was around 8.3% on average in the past decade. Based on past history, we expect a mid-to high-single-digit percentage increase annually.\n\nThe share price has been relatively flat in 2024, resulting in a dividend yield of approximately 3%. This yield is backed by an adequate payout ratio of approximately 65%. Free cash flow of $7.92 billion exceeds the dividend distribution requirement of $6.84 billion. The B+ dividend quality grade and the A+/A1 investment-grade credit ratings boost dividend safety.\n\nDespite growing top and bottom lines, PepsiCo\u2019s stock price is below its all-time high set in May 2023. It currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6x, below the 5-year range. However, consensus earnings are anticipated to grow in 2024 and 2025. We view PepsiCo as a buy. It is one of those stocks that investors can buy and set on autopilot as part of a\u00a0dividend reinvestment plan.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom its founding in 1980, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) has grown into a leading biotechnology company. The firm is now valued above $160 billion. It is known for innovative blockbuster therapies like Enbrel to treat plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis; Otezla for the treatment of adult patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and oral ulcers; and Prolia to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\nStory continues\n\nBesides these drugs, Amgen has strengths and products in oncology, immunology, and cardiology. Total revenue was greater than $28 billion in 2023.\n\nAmgen has paid a dividend since 2011. It is a Dividend Contender with a 12-year streak of increases. Because of the share price decline this year, the dividend yield has reached 3%. This value is below the 5-year average and more than double that of the S&P 500. The dividend is growing about 10% per year. We anticipate the rate to continue in the near term because of the moderate 46% payout ratio.\n\nThe moderate payout ratio suggests that the dividend safety is still excellent. The equity receives a B from Portfolio Insight for its dividend quality. The one detraction is the high leverage ratio of 4.4x because of acquisitions. Amgen also has a BBB+/Baa1 investment credit rating. In addition, free cash flow of $7.4 billion more than covers the dividend requirement of $4.56 billion.\n\nAmgen\u2019s struggling share price makes it attractive for income and dividend growth investors. AMGN stock is undervalued and trades at about 14 times anticipated 2024 earnings. As a result, we view this equity as a buy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) on a gas station roof.\n\nSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.com\n\nClimbing energy prices have resulted in the energy sector outperforming the other ten in 2024. High demand combined with curtailed supply will probably keep prices elevated. Integrated oil and natural gas companies, like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), should benefit.\n\nChevron is the second-largest American integrated oil firm. It operates in two business segments: Upstream and Downstream. The Upstream business explores, develops, produces, and transports crude oil and natural gas. The Downstream business refines crude oil into petroleum and petrochemical products. Total revenue was $196 billion in 2023.\n\nBecause of increasing oil prices, Chevron\u2019s revenue should be more in 2024 than in 2023. Similarly, earnings per share should be greater, too. People can also buy Chevron and get a 4% yield, with a dividend climbing from 4% to 6% per year.\n\nThis yield and growth come with solid dividend safety. The firm is a 2024 Dividend Aristocrat with a 37-year streak of increases. The payout ratio is only 46%, and free cash flow of almost $20 billion easily covers the ordinary dividend requirement of $11.3 billion. Chevron earns an A dividend quality grade, meaning it\u2019s in the 90th percentile of dividend-paying stocks. It also has an AA-/Aa2 high-grade investment credit rating, giving greater confidence about safety.\n\nWe view Chevron as a buy because of the excellent yield, dividend growth, and reasonable valuation of 12.5 times earnings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held a LONG position in PEP and AMGN.

        "content": "In this article, we will explore the 10 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy. To skip our detailed analysis of the snacks sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy.\n\nThe snack food industry, especially the segments involving cookies and crackers, continues to exhibit strong growth patterns. Consumer preferences are shifting towards convenience foods and indulgent treats. Companies leading the way in this sector not only boast robust product lines but also demonstrate innovative approaches to marketing and distribution that appeal to a broad consumer base.\n\nHousehold names such as Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) have long dominated the cookies and crackers market. The iconic brands under their belts have become staples in homes globally. Mondelez, the powerhouse behind Oreo and Chips Ahoy!, and Kellogg, known for its Keebler and Cheez-It brands, have not only capitalized on their legacy products but have also been pioneers in adopting healthier ingredients and catering to evolving consumer tastes.\n\nApart from the giants, there are emerging players that have started to make significant waves in the industry. The Simply Good Foods Company (NASDAQ:SMPL) is gaining attention with its approach to offering gluten-free and low-carb options. It is targeting health-conscious consumers. Another notable mention is Lotus Bakeries. It is a Belgian company famous for its Biscoff cookies, which have seen an impressive penetration in the U.S. market thanks to its unique flavor profile and successful marketing strategies.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Growth Opportunities\n\nThe global cookie and cracker market was valued at $100 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.9% to reach $122 billion by 2030. The industry is undergoing a significant shift, and consumers are now increasingly inclined towards healthier snack options. Sustainability and ethical practices are increasingly becoming factors that influence consumer choices. Companies like Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY) have ventured into the snack segment with acquisitions like Amplify Snack Brands. The company is committing to more sustainable packaging and sourcing to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.\n\nReducing plastic waste remains a key priority for the industry. Recently, British crisps company Two Farmers developed 100% compostable packaging made from eucalyptus cellulose. Major snack companies like Frito-Lay and Kettle Chips are also experimenting with alternative materials, driven by consumer demand and potential regulations aimed at reducing plastic waste.\n\nStory continues\n\nInflation Remains a Challenge\n\nThe food industry has been facing significant challenges in the recent past. The Russia-Ukraine war disrupted supply chains, impacting the prices of many commodities used in food items. Currently, inflation continues to impact the cookies and crackers companies. Popular biscuit company Pladis has indicated that prices may increase by up to 5% due to rising global costs for key ingredients like sugar and wheat.\n\nMondelez International CEO Dirk Van de Put expressed concerns about persistent inflation at the company\u2019s recent earnings call. The company remains cautious about ongoing inflationary pressures. The rising cocoa prices in the recent past have impacted the company\u2019s financial performance of late. However, overall sentiment for 2024 remains optimistic, with expectations of strong earnings growth for the company.\n\nHere is what the management commented on how inflation is expected to affect the company\u2019s performance going forward during Q4 2023 earnings call.\n\nAs Europe faces more inflation than any other market, we expect customer disruption during Q1 and potentially into Q2, associated with our annual price negotiation process. This process is happening earlier in some cases than last year, so intact might be more pronounced in Q1 for top and margin lines. We also remain committed to substantial brand support in this region and all the others, similar to our stance over the last past several years. In terms of interest expenses, we expect approximately $325 million. We are expecting $0.03 of EPS of headwinds related to forex impact for the year. In terms of taxes, we expect an ETR in the mid-20s. Share repurchase expectations are around $2 billion. Turning to our EPS outlook on page 21. With respect to adjusted EPS, we expect high single digit growth of our reported base \u201923 of $3.30 per share, which includes the $0.11 of contribution from our divested developed gum business. Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo pick out the firms for this article, we first gathered all the publicly traded firms that operate in the cookies and crackers space. Then, the number of hedge funds out of the 933 funds part of Insider Monkey's database for the fourth quarter of 2023 that had invested in them was determined. The list was then ranked according to the number of hedge fund positions in each company.\n\nBest Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Invest In\n\n10. Kellogg Company (NYSE:KLG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nKellogg Company (NYSE:KLG) is primarily for its cereals and breakfast foods. The company extends its product range to snack bars and crackers, including its Special K cracker chips and Nutri-Grain bars, which contain cookie-like textures and flavors.\n\n23 hedge funds had positions in Kellogg Company (NYSE:KLG) in Q4 valued at $89.56 million.\n\nIn addition to Kellogg Company (NYSE:KLG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) are part of our list of 10 best cookies and crackers stocks to invest in.\n\n9. Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\n\nIn addition to its flagship soup products, Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) owns the Pepperidge Farm brand, which is well-known for its range of premium cookies and crackers, including the iconic Milano cookies and Goldfish crackers.\n\nCampbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) saw a small decline in hedge fund holders from 26 to 25 but an almost doubling in the total value of holdings from $218.24 million to $412.62 million.\n\nCampbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) recently reported its Q2 2024 results. The president of the company, Mark Clouse, said the following about the Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB)\u2019s recent performance and future outlook.\n\nOur condensed cooking portfolio saw both dollar and volume share increase in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter we\u2019ve held or grew both metrics. We also saw similar strength in our broth portfolio, with Swanson Broth and stock growing above the category rate and dollar consumption up 13%. In addition, while growing consumption, this portion of our portfolio also had dollar and volume share gains in the quarter. While the eating soup landscape remains more challenging, we did see sequential improvement in the second quarter as it relates to dollar share on Chunky and our condensed eating portfolio. The longer term outlook for ready-to-serve soup remains quite strong, supported by a combination of continued Chunky innovation and marketing, expansion of the successful launch of Pacific ready-to-eat soup, and we\u2019re also excited about the impact of including the strength of the super-premium Rao\u2019s soup line, adding approximately a full point of share growth to the portfolio.\n\n8. Flowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE:FLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 26\n\nFlowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE:FLO) is known for bakery products, including fresh breads, buns, and rolls. The company also owns the Tastykake brand, which offers a range of cookies, including the popular Krimpets and Kandy Kakes that have a cookie-like base.\n\nFor Flowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE:FLO), there was a slight decrease in hedge fund interest, with the count going down from 27 to 26, yet the total value of holdings went up from $166.74 million to $252.76 million.\n\n7. Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nTraditionally a cereal company, Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) has diversified into various food segments. The company's foray into the snack aisle complements its breakfast products, leveraging its expertise in grain-based foods to offer a variety of snacking options. The company\u2019s cookies and crackers segment caters to the growing consumer demand for convenient and delicious snack alternatives.\n\nThe number of hedge funds invested in Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) stayed steady at 32, but the total value of holdings edged up from $908.28 million to $1.01 billion, marking an increase of roughly $100.00 million.\n\nArgosy Investors made the following comment about Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\nFinally, I added to Post Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:POST) because it is a long-term position that was undersized, and POST had recently announced a large acquisition of pet food brands that act as a new platform. POST is turning back to the clock by creating a reincarnation of Ralston-Purina, the conglomerate Bill Stiritz ran many years ago with great success. Like Stiritz\u2019s Ralston, POST has been a consistent purchaser of its own shares, demonstrates improved efficiency within its own businesses, and occasionally makes disciplined acquisitions to bolster existing franchises or add new platforms. Additionally, POST is not an empire builder, as it has sold its private label food business to a private equity firm, and spun off BellRing Brands in recent years. With the spinoff of WL Kellogg in recent days, and due to Kellogg\u2019s lower margins, I would be surprised if POST does not try to acquire some portion of WL Kellogg, although it would likely need to divest some cereal assets to avoid regulatory scrutiny. POST trades relatively inexpensively, at a 9.1x EV/EBITDA ratio, and means that POST is positioned to continue its unique value creation going forward.\n\n6. The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35\n\nThe J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) is largely associated with its fruit spreads, but its acquisition strategy has allowed it to enter different food segments.\n\nThe J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) experienced an increase in hedge fund holders from 33 to 35. The total value of these holdings doubled from nearly $459.50 million to $1.03 billion. The gain of approximately $573.88 million signals a potent uptick in market confidence in The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM).\n\nMark Smucker, President of The J.M. Smucker Company (NYSE:SJM) said the following about the company\u2019s performance during Q3 2024 earnings call.\n\nAnd in addition, we still saw \u2014 in addition to the lap in the retail space, we still saw really good performance in both Canada and very strong performance in the Away From Home space. But I think notably, if you look at consumer takeaway in the quarter, the consumer takeaway remains very strong, which again, helps to support our confidence in the double-digit growth and the reacceleration of the brand as we move forward into the next several quarters. And then I guess just one final point about Uncrustables, remember, we just turned on marketing. So we\u2019ve had great \u2014 not only the advertising, both in traditional and social channels, but also the endorsements that we\u2019ve had across some of our professional sports sponsorships and then our ability to continue to gain distribution in all of those channels just supports the confidence in that brand.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n15 States with the Largest Oil Reserves in the US 20 Most Diverse Countries in Asia 15 Best Places to Retire in Georgia\n\nDisclosure.None. 10 Best Cookies and Crackers Stocks to Buywas initially published on Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

WK Kellogg the North America cereal business, is up nearly 75% from where it closed on its first day of trading as an independent company on Oct. 2.

        "title": "Marias Gamesa\u00ae Encourages Connection Among Latina Moms with the Return of Cafecito Con Marias Gamesa Campaign and Virtual Community",
        "content": "The Campaign Aims to Help Moms Engage in Real Conversations About Motherhood and Cultivate a Community as New Marias Gamesa Survey Reveals 70% of Latina Moms Feel Too Overwhelmed or Don't Have Enough Time to Ask for Support\n\nPURCHASE, N.Y., May 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of Mother's Day, the iconic Mexican cookie brand Marias Gamesa\u00ae is bringing back Cafecito con Marias Gamesa, a platform offering a virtual community of support for Latinas navigating motherhood in the U.S. This year, Marias Gamesa is partnering with parenting podcast Super Mam\u00e1s to explore the topics of relationships and prioritizing personal interests after the brand's recent survey revealed Latina moms aren't leaning on their village of support, including their own moms or mother figures. Marias Gamesa is helping Latina moms connect with a supportive virtual community.\n\nAccording to Marias Gamesa's new survey of 503 Gen Z and Millennial Latina moms, most reported having a support system and/or seeking more regular connections to navigate motherhood; however, they are not tapping into their village of support enough.\n\n90% of Latina moms feel at ease reaching out to their mom or mother figure for support, yet a surprising 70% describe feeling too overwhelmed and time-strapped to even call them. 62% of Latina moms report feeling relieved after connecting with their own mothers after challenging parenting moments. While 64% of Latina moms said they have support systems, 20% aren't using them and face tough parenting moments alone.\n\nThe need for connection between Latina moms and their own mother figures is highlighted in Marias Gamesa's latest digital campaign \"M\u00e1rcale a Mam\u00e1\" (\"Call Mom\"), which serves as a reminder that no matter how busy or challenging life becomes, a call to mom can be as powerful as a hug.\n\nFacing judgment about their parenting style and feeling guilty about prioritizing personal interests outside of family may be hindering their outreach for support. Despite the obstacles Latina moms are facing, 80% are still finding creative ways to prioritize themselves.\n\n83% of Latina moms reported feeling judged for their parenting decisions, with meal choices being the common source of scrutiny. Latina moms recognize the importance of pursuing personal interests to balance motherhood, even though 45% occasionally feel guilty about it. When possible, 80% of Latina moms use the following shortcuts for finding \"me\" time: asking their children to join in on their personal interests or utilizing their children's nap times.\n\nThese findings and more will be explored during the Super Mam\u00e1s podcast with hosts Paulina and Bricia Lopez in episodes airing this May. Fans are invited to join in the conversation on social media using #CafecitoConMariasGamesa to share their own motherhood stories and join the virtual village of support for moms, by moms.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"As a Latina mom myself, I know firsthand the importance of being part of a community like Cafecito con Marias Gamesa that empowers us to be honest about our motherhood experiences. The reality is, we don't always have it together, and it can be difficult to ask for help,\" said Paulina Lopez, co-founder and co-host of Super Mam\u00e1s. \"It's great to see a brand I grew up with celebrate and encourage Latina moms this way, and we're excited to be part of the Marias Gamesa village of support.\"\n\nAlso joining the Cafecito con Marias Gamesa community is the Marias Gamesa Squad, a group of four inspiring Latina mothers and content creators sharing their real motherhood experiences through their social channels and by serving as special guests on the Super Mam\u00e1s podcast this month. The Marias Gamesa Squad will invite Latina mothers to share their own perspectives on topics such as rekindling personal relationships, dealing with \"mom guilt,\" and reprioritizing personal passions.\n\n\"As a brand that prides itself in being as authentic as mom's love, Marias Gamesa celebrates all the effort, energy and love that moms and mother figures continue to pour into their families and everything they do. We want to help reconnect them to their personal passions and the important relationships in their lives,\" said Gustavo Cecilio, senior marketing director, PepsiCo Foods North America's Hispanic Business Unit. \"With the return of Cafecito con Marias Gamesa and the launch of our new \"M\u00e1rcale a Mam\u00e1\" campaign, we hope moms feel seen, heard, and appreciated on Mother's Day and beyond.\"\n\nIn addition to joining in on the #CafecitoConMariasGamesa conversations on social, Marias Gamesa wants fans to stay connected with the moms in their lives with a reminder to #M\u00e1rcaleAMam\u00e1. Viewers can catch the campaign running on Meta, YouTube and TikTok through Mother's Day.\n\nFor more information about Marias Gamesa, please visit www.gamesacookies.com, and follow @mariasgamesausa on Instagram and on TikTok.\n\nAbout\u00a0Gamesa\u00ae\r\nGamesa\u00a0is\u00a0Mexico's\u00a0largest manufacturer of cookies.

        "content": "In this article, we will be covering the population trends and demographics in New York while taking a look at the 10 fastest-growing cities in the state. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Fastest Growing Cities in New York State.\n\nPopulation Dynamics in the US\n\nAs reported by the US Census Bureau, 42 US states and the District of Columbia experienced a rise in their populations in 2023 as compared to 31 states and the District of Columbia in 2022. While net international migration going back to pre-pandemic levels contributed to this trend, a decrease in net domestic outmigration for some states was another contributing factor. Based on numeric population growth, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina ranked as the top states. These numeric growths were recorded at 473,453 for Texas, 365,205 for Florida, and 139,526 for North Carolina in 2023.\n\nAn analysis of the metropolitan and the micropolitan statistical areas in the country indicated that population growth was witnessed in 73% of the 387 metro areas between 2022 and 2023. During the same period, the population increased in 58% of the U.S. micro areas. In terms of annual numeric growth, Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands ranked at the top with their respective growths of 152,598 and 139,789. Some of the most prominent percentage gains in population were recorded in Florida metros, in Wildwood-The Villages by 4.7%, in Lakeland-Winter Haven by 3.8%, in Ocala by 3.4%, and in Port St. Lucie by 3.1%. Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach also recorded a growth of 3.7% and ranked third among the fastest-growing US metro areas.\n\nNew York City's Current Population\n\nAs reported by the NYC Department of City Planning, the population of New York City was estimated to be 8.26 million in July 2023. This represents a decrease of 546,000 since the April 1, 2020 Census and a decline of 78,000 since July 1, 2022. Therefore, population losses have been recorded in the state from 2020 to 2023.\n\nOn March 14, The New York Times reported that the aforementioned NYC population losses of 78,000 residents in 2023 and more than 126,000 residents in 2022 do not take into account the migrants and those living in shelters and dorms. Since the spring of 2022, the city welcomed 180,000 migrants. It has been projected that population growth in the city will resume in the years to come and has stabilized since the pandemic.\n\nPopulation Trends and Demographics in New York\n\nNet domestic migration tends to significantly impact population change. Net domestic migration in NYC has been negative which implies that more people tend to leave the city than move into the city. Large net domestic outflows following 2020 have also led to population losses in NYC. On November 21, 2023, The US Census Bureau reported that people who moved between the states increased from almost 7.9 million people in 2021 to nearly 8.2 million people in 2022. Movers left highly populated states for their neighboring states for example people moving from New York to New Jersey. New York and California were the two top states that had the highest share of people who moved out of them out of the total number of movers. Many New Yorkers migrated to cheaper states such as New Jersey where they could easily commute to work. Some of them resorted to a warmer state such as Florida.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemographic data demonstrates that those struggling have been leaving the most. In 2023, 4 out of the 5 boroughs saw a decline in their populations. Affordability and housing issues tend to force lower- and middle-income residents to move out. This is evident from the fact that families earning between $32,000 and $65,000 left the city at the fastest rate in 2022. You can also take a look at the 16 best places to live in Upstate New York for families. The poorest borough, The Bronx, lost more than 25,000 residents while Brooklyn saw a loss of more than 28,000 residents. More than 26,000 left Queens as well. Commuter areas around New York City also recorded a loss in residents. On the other hand, the population grew in Manhattan, the richest borough, by nearly 3,000 residents in 2023.\n\nA recent survey from The Citizens Budget Commission reveals that New Yorkers have rated the quality of life and quality of city services as low. Only 30% of New Yorkers rate the quality of life as excellent or good while one-third rate the quality of life as poor. The residents have also rated the city\u2019s neighborhoods better. Simultaneously, just 24% rated the quality of government services as good or excellent as compared to 44% in 2017. Wealthier households with incomes over $200,000 were also found to be more satisfied with the quality of life in their neighborhoods.\n\nThe State\u2019s Business Potential\n\nDespite the population dynamics showing underprivileged people moving out of New York, the state has long been regarded as a dominant business and economic hub. The state is home to leading multinationals including PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).\n\nThe multinational PepsiCo, Inc.

It offers more than 300 beverage choices and renowned brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, bubbly, and Mountain Dew.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational finance company. The company operates as one of the largest employers in New York. While the firm contributes $29.8 billion annually to New York City\u2019s economy, it plans to further commit to the city. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported the construction of its new state-of-the-art global headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. During the project building, more than 8,000 construction jobs will be created thereby driving additional economic activity of $3.6 billion for New York State.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best recession dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their past performance during recessionary periods, and go directly to read 5 Best Recession Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nSeveral financial analysts, previously forecasting a recession in the US at the end of 2022, have now turned optimistic about the market\u2019s outlook. The US economy experienced growth at an annualized rate of 4% in the second half of the year, leading experts to maintain a positive outlook on the country\u2019s economic prospects. In fact, data from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicates that recessions have become increasingly less frequent in the US. From 1990 to 2023, the US economy endured 36 months of recession, with the most recent recession occurring in 2020 and lasting for only two months. Their analysis further suggested that recessions were more common as we go further back in time.\n\nWhile the likelihood of a recession is uncertain at the moment, investors have consistently maintained their focus on dividend stocks whenever concerns about a recession arise. In addition to dividends, analysts also recommend investing in industries that are known for their resilience and stability to ensure prudent investment choices. For example, industries such as healthcare, utilities, consumer staples, and telecommunications are considered less vulnerable to economic shifts, making them reliable for navigating through a recession. According to a report by Business Insider, the consumer staples sector outperformed the market by 49% over a 25-year period ending in 2015. The report further mentioned that a significant portion of this outperformance was observed during recessionary periods.\n\nInvestors favor these industries because they not only offer dividends to shareholders but have also raised their payouts over the years. According to data collected from Janus Henderson, global healthcare dividends grew from $94.5 billion in 2017 to nearly $135 billion in 2023. Similarly, dividends from the energy sector also jumped from $104.6 billion in 2017 to $173.7 billion last year. Dividend stocks have shown strong performance during recessionary periods.\n\nFollowing the major recession of 2008, investors became more mindful of their investment strategies and recognized that dividend stocks are a reliable approach for sailing through economic downturns. Nova Southeastern University conducted research and found that during both the recovery and recessionary phases of 2001 and 2008 recessions, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of some of the best dividend stocks that have grown their payouts for at least 25 years, showed significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. In particular, during the recovery phase of the 2008 recession, the index outpaced the broader market by 0.01% daily or an annualized rate of 4.59%. Moreover, during the recessionary phase of 2008, the dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 by 0.06% daily or an annualized rate of 23.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks to consider for a recession include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). These companies have decades-long dividend growth streaks and maintain strong balance sheets that help them remain resilient during recessionary periods. In this article, we will further discuss the best dividend stocks to buy for a recession. 11 Best Recession Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we used Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023 and identified dividend stocks from industries that are known to be recession-proof, such as healthcare, consumer staples, telecommunications, and utilities. From that list, we selected dividend stocks that have consistently increased their payouts for over 10 years. Finally, we shortlisted 11 best dividend stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors tracked by Insider Monkey as of Q4 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nIn addition to covering topics like best dividend stocks to buy, at Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, artificial intelligence technology is on the cusp of earth-shattering breakthroughs, so we identified the cheapest AI stock that is trading at less than 5 times its market value excluding cash and investments with the potential to deliver 100x returns. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can.

        "title": "Time to Cut Your Losses on SOFI Stock? Why This Former Bull Is Waving the White Flag.",
        "content": "I was wrong about SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) stock. After three years of waiting for a return on my investment, I sold my shares recently, at a loss.\n\nThe stock currently sells at about $7/share. If you got in a year ago, when it traded near $5, you\u2019re in great shape. But I\u2019d still recommend you sell it.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSoFi Stock and Consumer Banking\n\nSoFi has evolved into a consumer bank. Its main business is taking deposits and making loans, for houses, for education, and for other life expenses.\n\nThis can be a good business. It\u2019s certainly growing for SoFi. SoFi revenues last year passed $2.1 billion. They were $1.57 billion in 2022, and under $1 billion the year before that.\n\nThe problem is that SoFi continues to lose money, because SoFi wants to be much more than a consumer bank.\n\nAs I wrote last November, it offers banking software through Technisys, banking services through Galileo, and automates risk management through Konecta.\n\nIt competes with Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ:HOOD) in brokerage. CEO Anthony Noto talks of it becoming a \u201c10-bagger,\u201d delivering 10-for-1 returns to investors.\n\nI bought this hook, line, and sinker. I defended the company after bad earnings last year, when it fell from $10/share to $8.\n\nBut it\u2019s still just a bank. Banks are defined by their \u201cyield spread,\u201d the difference between what they pay for money and what they rent it for.\n\nBut SoFi\u2019s spread is narrower than the big banks it competes with. That\u2019s because it\u2019s paying depositors 4.5% for their money, with no account fees.\n\nBanking Breaking Bad\n\nI wasn\u2019t just wrong on SoFi. I was wrong about the whole banking sector.\n\nI figured that once money started costing money, as it does now, selling money should be a great business. But banks are leveraged. They compete with private equity companies that aren\u2019t.\n\nBanks face regulation private lenders don\u2019t. They also hold reserves against deposits, whose return could be lower than what\u2019s needed to run the business. Watch those maturities!\n\nAgainst this backdrop, SoFi is also taking low-quality credits. I love millennials and have two of my own. But lending to low net-worth borrowers carries risk. SoFi reported 4.8% of its loans were in default at the end of March.\n\nSoFi keeps seeking new niches that might offer a greater return. Buying Wyndham Capital last year got it into home loans, but it hasn\u2019t expanded that niche. Its growth in the March quarter was still in personal loans.\n\nThat\u2019s why professional money managers have soured on SoFi. Tipranks now has just as many buyers as sellers, 4, with eight on the fence.\n\nStory continues\n\nTraders at Stocktwits remain bullish, copying Noto\u2019s statements like he\u2019s Warren Buffett of Berkshire-Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B). He\u2019s not.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make money in SoFi stock right now. The stock might even go up from here. The question is how much you might make and whether that is worth your time.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nWatching TV analyst Jim Cramer\u2019s contortions over the Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) quarter, I was reminded of an old investment aphorism. Not all good companies are good investments.\n\nSoFi is a good company. Noto is a good operator. In the present economic cycle, it\u2019s just not a great investment.\n\nThere\u2019s always an opportunity cost in what you own. I decided my money could be doing something else. I could own Amazon. Com (NASDAQ:AMZN), or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIf you insist on owning banks, buy JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). If you really need diversification, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) isn\u2019t a bad bet.\n\nBut you learn to pull the plug on what doesn\u2019t work. Selling is the hardest lesson investors learn. Not everything works. SoFi didn\u2019t.\n\nAs of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN, NVDA, and PEP.

        "title": "Dividend Investors Love Coca-Cola Stock and Pepsi Stock. But This Other Beverage Stock Might Be Poised for Better Dividend Growth.",
        "content": "When it comes to dividend investing, one could do worse than beverage giants The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) and PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). Both companies have two key traits that dividend investors crave: Predictability and high yields.\n\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi are two of the most predictable dividend payers on the market. Both companies have paid and increased their dividends for more than 50 years (61 years and 51 years, respectively), earning them the prestigious title Dividend King.\n\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi are also both considered to have high-yield dividends -- a yield is how much investors get back compared to the value of the investment. The yield for Coca-Cola is over 3%, whereas the yield for Pepsi is just below that. But as the chart below shows, the yield for both companies is more than double the average for the S&P 500. KO Dividend Yield Chart\n\nHowever, if there's a knock against Coca-Cola and Pepsi as dividend investments, it's in their ability to grow their dividends.\n\nIn February, Coca-Cola announced that it was raising its dividend by about 5%. For its part, Pepsi's latest raise (also announced in February) was better at 10%. Therefore, they are growing dividends, but it's fair to wonder if raises in future years will be as big as these.\n\nMany investors look at a company's cash flow and compare it to dividend payments to get a sense of how much a dividend can grow over time. In Coca-Cola's case, this year it expects full-year free cash flow of $9.2 billion, down slightly from 2023. But it paid $8 billion in dividends in 2023 and just raised its dividend by 5%. Therefore, future raises could be small because its dividend is eating up a lot of its current cash flow.\n\nPepsi is in a similar situation. It doesn't talk about free cash flow in its earnings reports. But looking at traditional profitability metrics shows a comparable situation. In 2024, the company expects to pay dividends of $5.06 per share. In comparison, it expects $8.15 in earnings per share (EPS) this year. Therefore, it expects to pay out 62% of its earnings as dividends this year, which leaves some room for future raises. But dividend increases likely won't outpace EPS growth.\n\nDividend growth is important for investors with longer time horizons. That's why dividend investors might want to give the third biggest beverage company, Keurig Dr Pepper(NASDAQ: KDP), a look today.\n\nCould Keurig Dr Pepper be a dividend growth stock?\n\nWith its dividend yield of 2.6%, many dividend investors will look past Keurig Dr Pepper stock and buy shares of Coca-Cola or Pepsi instead, given the higher yields. However, Keurig Dr Pepper has increased its dividend at a faster rate over the last five years, and I believe it can do it again.\n\nStory continues PEP Dividend Chart\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper just reported financial results, and its profits are finally surging after years of disappointing progress.\n\nOver the last five years, Keurig Dr Pepper's gross profit growth has outpaced revenue growth, which is a good thing to see. The company's operating profit growth is outpacing progress with its gross profit, which is even better. While this is a five-year trend, the trend since the beginning of 2023 is more pronounced. KDP Operating Income (TTM) Chart\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper's management credits its improvements to just good old-fashioned operational discipline. What I like about this kind of improvement is that it's not driven by external factors, which are unpredictable and perhaps not repeatable. The company can sustain its success and even further build on it.\n\nAs it is, Keurig Dr Pepper has a dividend payout ratio of just 54%, according to YCharts. That's far lower than the payout ratios for Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which are both at 74%. This metric alone suggests that Keurig Dr Pepper has more room to grow its dividend at a faster pace than the other two. And if the company keeps growing its earnings at a faster pace, then it will have even more room.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper won't necessarily be the top-performing stock on the market year in and year out -- it's a mature business and growth is modest. But from a dividend perspective, I believe Keurig Dr Pepper can supply investors with consistency, a generous yield, and above-average dividend growth for the next several years and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Keurig Dr Pepper right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) Upcoming Dividend Will Be Larger Than Last Year's",
        "content": "The board of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has announced that the dividend on 28th of June will be increased to $1.36, which will be 7.1% higher than last year's payment of $1.26 which covered the same period. This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.\n\nView our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo's Earnings Easily Cover The Distributions\n\nWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, PepsiCo's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 96% of cash flows. This is certainly a risk factor, as reduced cash flows could force the company to pay a lower dividend.\n\nThe next year is set to see EPS grow by 41.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 59% which brings it into quite a comfortable range. historic-dividend\n\nPepsiCo Has A Solid Track Record\n\nEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.27 total annually to $5.06. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.3% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.\n\nDividend Growth Is Doubtful\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Over the past five years, it looks as though PepsiCo's EPS has declined at around 5.6% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think PepsiCo is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.\n\nCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 most common counterfeit foods in the US. If you want to see more of the most common counterfeit foods in the US, go directly to the 5 most common counterfeit foods in the US.\n\nThe global food market brings together the many sectors of agriculture, production, distribution, and consumption, making it one of the largest and most exquisite networks in human history. Food travels via intricate dances of supply and demand, tradition and invention, and sustenance and culture. Around the world, it starts in vast agricultural fields and finishes in packed grocery aisles, bustling ports of commerce, and little kitchens.\n\nAs of 2024, the food industry earned $10.07 trillion in sales, and it is expected to expand at a rate of 6.53% per year (CAGR 2024-2028). Confectionery and snacks represent the biggest section of the market, with an estimated value of $1.77 trillion by 2024.\n\nIn the global sense, the food market is naturally most vital one, and it continues to experience changing trends, in forms of shifting tastes and innovation in technology. In terms of the recent future projections, the market is expecting to squirt out 6% of its revenue through digital means by 2024 end, indicating towards the global digitization across the global sectors.\n\nIn the realm of food, U.S. continues to rule globally, meeting the emerging food-related needs of the world. The country's industry spans across organic fruits, packaged foods, dairy products, and ready-to-eat products, with fierce competition and innovation driving the sector. Moreover, the huge population figure of round-about 330 million further fuels the market competition and size. The country's food service market alone stood at $824.61 billion in 2022, expected to reach $1.767 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights!\n\nWith such an established control over the global food supply, it's essential to have a look at some of the food-related giants of the U.S. market. Namely, we are going to discuss PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY).\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), which engages in the categories of beverage, food, and snack, has its headquarters located in Harrison New York. It\u2019s the biggest company whose roots go back to 1898. As per 2023\u2019s annual report, the segment percentage profit of PepsiCo (NasdaqGS: PEP) Beverages in North America is 18%, and in Latin America, it is 16%.\n\nTyson Foods, founded in 1935, is an international food company that focuses on chicken, pig, and beef. In the fiscal year 2024, Tyson (NYSE:TSN) expects adjusted operating profits to range from $800 million to $1 billion. For the same period, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) expects its overall company-adjusted operating income to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the biggest producers of chocolate in the world, The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) now distributes milkshakes and other beverages in addition to baked goods like cakes and cookies.\u00a0One of the few milk chocolate companies in the world that still makes their product with fresh milk is Hershey's\u00a0Milk Chocolate, which contributes to its unique flavor. The Hershey Company\u2019s (NYSE:HSY) business performed admirably in 2023, as seen by a noteworthy 7.2% increase in net sales growth. Furthermore, diluted adjusted earnings per share increased significantly by 12.6% in the year.\n\nEven while some well-known food brands get most of the attention, numerous other companies in the food industry are equally a part of counterfeit foods.\u00a0The reliability of the global food manufacturing system is constantly at risk by the counterfeit food sector, which flows into markets with fake goods that harm trust among consumers, risk consumer health, and compromise economic stability.\n\nIn the United States, a country widely recognized for its diverse food production scene and rich agriculture industry, the widespread use of counterfeit food is a serious issue. The variety of such foods that are being sold in the United States is huge and includes anything from olive oil to salmon. There are many food items that are not healthy; hence, one should be wary of their intake of processed meat items like sausages, salami, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and beef burgers because they are frequently heavy in salt and fat. The healthiest option is to consume white meat without any skin; white flesh from chicken is regarded by many experts as the leanest and cleanest meat to consume. Just like meat, counterfeit foods cause many health issues as well, which is why we will now be discussing the 15 most common counterfeit foods in the US. 15 Most Common Counterfeit Foods in the US\n\nAgnes Kantaruk/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo come up with 15 different counterfeit food items, we carefully selected information from more than 15 reliable sources, which include but aren\u2019t limited to modern sites like Bon Appetite, My Recipes, etc. This wide range of sources guarantees a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The consensus approach is used to rank food items i.e. the food items that were repeated more, in number of times, in sites were ranked higher and the less repetitive were given a lower rank.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15. Baby Formula\n\nNo of times repeated: 1\n\nFirst on our list of the 15 most common counterfeit foods in the US is baby formula. Baby formula is linked to serious health risks as well as a high chance of dietary fraud. Remember the melamine-contaminated Chinese baby formula? Tainted milk, which is extremely harmful, might be a part of the formula. Scammers may dilute baby formula with extra substances, including water or fillers, to increase product volume to\u00a0maximize revenue.\n\n14. Black Pepper\n\nNo of times repeated: 2\n\nNext on our list of 15 most common counterfeit foods in the US is Black Pepper. Similar to crushed cinnamon, ground black pepper is also very difficult to identify in powder form. Researchers have discovered that purported black pepper contains papaya seeds, juniper berries, pepper stems, and chaff. Similar to coffee, it's best to go full in terms of flavors and to stay away from adding colored starch to your supper.\n\n13. Truffle Oil\n\nNo. of times repeated: 3\n\nAlthough truffle oils are no longer as common among chefs, specialized merchants still sell a large variety of them. On the other hand, truffle oil is a total hoax because not a single truffle particle is present in it.\n\n12. Wasabi\n\nNo. of times repeated: 3\n\nThe sushi makers use water to make wasabi paste out of powdered fake wasabi. You might be shocked to learn that real wasabi tastes quite different from the scorching feeling that is commonly associated with it. Wasabi tastes sweet and has a hint of spice when it's freshly grated. It also smells herbal. Since there is a shortage of wasabi compared to the demand, authentic wasabi is pricey and cannot be given away by sushi restaurants.\n\n11. Saffron\n\nNo. of times repeated: 4\n\nIn addition to being a staple in many foreign cuisines, saffron is also used in medicines and cosmetics. Saffron, sometimes referred to as \"red gold,\" is expensive because of its labor-intensive production. The violet bloom with crimson stigmas on the saffron crocus, which is the source of saffron, must be painstakingly picked by hand. India, Greece, Morocco, and Iran all harvest it. Due to its high cost and limited supply, saffron is a prime target for counterfeiting by many sellers.\n\n10. Vanilla\n\nNo. of times repeated: 4\n\nSince real vanilla beans are used in their production, real vanilla extract has a flavor profile that is both rich and complex. On the other hand, the main component of counterfeit vanilla extract is synthetic vanillin, which has a less complex and more obvious flavor. Sometimes people become confused by the counterfeit version thinking it is the actual extract, even when attempts are made to recreate the authentic flavor.\n\n9. Alcohol\n\nNo. of times repeated: 5\n\nThe most common forms of wine counterfeiting involve bottling an average wine under a prestigious label or passing off a lower-quality vintage for one that is well-known to fetch a higher price. According to experts, five percent of wines sold are counterfeit, costing American companies $250 million in lost revenue! This shouldn't be a problem unless you plan to fill your cellar with back-vintage Chateau Laffite. If so, however, you should be aware of the number of Ts in Laffite.\n\n8. Milk\n\nNo. of times repeated: 5\n\nAt number eight on our list of the 15 most common counterfeit foods in the US is Milk because you can never tell if water is added to increase the volume of milk which reduces the nutrients present in milk. Mostly, the milk suppliers add dry milk or powdered milk to increase volume and sell it at higher rates. Not just that, some chemicals like hydrogen peroxide are used in milk to prolong its life. Often plant milk for example, almond milk, may be sold as the usual cow milk. The sellers could also repackage the expired milk and sell and consumers would never know.\n\n7. Fruit juice\n\nNo. of times repeated: 6\n\nFruit juices can have artificial flavors and colors added to them, or they might be diluted with water or other less expensive juices. As soon as pomegranate juice gained popularity as the Next Big Superfood, there was a method to imitate it. According to research, pomegranate juice isn't even present in some drinks, and many are enhanced with other liquids.\n\n6. Parmesan cheese\n\nNo. of times repeated: 6\n\nWhen Bloomberg News tested store-bought grated cheeses for cellulose in February 2017, it found that every cheese tested, known as 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese, included the wood pulp-based anti-clumping ingredient. Although cellulose is a safe ingredient, Dean Sommer, a cheese engineer, says that 2% to 4% is an appropriate amount. Since wood pulp is less expensive than pure Parmesan, cheese manufacturers frequently add more of it to their cheeses.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out the 5 Most Common Counterfeit Foods in the US.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Fast Food Chains with the Most Locations in the World 25 Biggest Food Companies in the World by Revenue 20 Foods To Reduce Cancer Risk\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Decoding PEP &amp; KO Post Q1 Earnings: Which Stock Stands Out?",
        "content": "The war between PepsiCo Inc. PEP and The Coca-Cola Company KO for the top spot is endless. While investors are always perplexed about choosing either of these stocks over the other, the two global soft drinks biggies have attracted investors for several reasons, including expansion efforts and shareholder returns.\n\nPEP & KO \u2013 Statistics & Share\n\nThe beverage soft drinks industry has evolved in the recent years, with consumers looking for healthier alternatives, moving away from the initial charm of carbonated drinks. With this, the industry\u2019s two heavyweights \u2014 Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, commanding market caps of $267.1 billion and $241.2 billion, respectively \u2014 have expanded their product portfolios to include juices, bottled water, functional beverages like sports and energy drinks, and coffee and tea.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola has retained its position as a market leader in the global non-alcoholic beverages industry, with more than 40% market share. With a key focus on non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, Coca-Cola has expanded its portfolio over the years, comprising brands like Powerade, SmartWater, Minute Maid, BODYARMOR, Costa, Dasani, dogadan, FUZE TEA and fairlife.\r\n\r\nComing to its arch-rival, PepsiCo has slowly diluted its position in the beverage industry, expanding in the complimentary convenient food segment, including snacking brands like Frito-Lay, Lay\u2019s Chips, Cheetos and a range of Quaker cereals. Then again, the company\u2019s beverage range includes brands like Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana juices, Mountain Dew, 7UP and Mirinda, garnering a market share of around 20% in the soft drinks industry.\r\n\r\nBased on market share and market cap, Coca-Cola commands a lead over its non-alcoholic beverage competitors, generating nearly 50% of the industry\u2019s global sales. However, PepsiCo continues to claim the second place in the industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough both soft drink behemoths are attractive long-term buys, with the first-quarter 2024 results of these companies reported in about two weeks, it is ideal to evaluate these stocks on the earnings ground.\n\nQ1 Earnings Score Card & Outlook\n\nBoth PepsiCo and Coca-Cola posted strong results for first-quarter 2024, notching neck-to-neck earnings per share growth rates of 7.3% and 7%, respectively. These also reflect a positive earnings surprise of 5.9% for PepsiCo and 4.4% for Coca-Cola compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, revenues improved 2.3% year over year for PepsiCo and 3% for Coca-Cola, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth for both beverage behemoths mainly resulted from the recently implemented price increases across all markets.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, both companies have provided positive revenue and earnings outlooks, anticipating continued momentum in their businesses. PepsiCo expects at least 4% year-over-year organic revenue growth for 2024, with core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8%. PEP anticipates 2024 core EPS to increase 7%, indicating continued gains from operational efficiencies.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola plans organic revenue growth of 8-9% for 2024, with comparable currency-neutral earnings per share estimated to increase 11-13% year over year. The company anticipates 2024 comparable earnings per share to improve 4-5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimates\n\nFrom the earnings and outlook perspective, both PEP and KO have scored full marks. Additionally, analysts\u2019 earnings expectations for both companies have moved higher following their results, indicating positive near-term prospects.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo\u2019s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $8.16 per share in the last 30 days. Notably, PEP\u2019s 2024 revenues are projected to grow 3.4% year over year to $94.6 billion and EPS are expected to ascent 7.1% year over year to $8.16.\r\n\r\nThen again, Coca-Cola\u2019s EPS estimates for 2024 moved up by a penny to $2.82 in the past seven days. KO\u2019s 2024 revenues are expected to increase 0.1% year over year to $45.8 billion and EPS is likely to advance 4.8% year over year to $2.82 per share.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can clearly see that PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have seen analysts raising estimates after their earnings releases. However, PepsiCo has higher expected growth rates for sales and earnings for this year. Consequently, PepsiCo currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStock Performance\n\nFollowing the earnings outcomes, we have seen upward share price revision trends for Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Notably, the PepsiCo stock has rallied 2.5% after reporting positive earnings results on Apr 23, 2024. The Coca-Cola stock moved up 0.4% in the last two days after reporting earnings on Apr 30, 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBoth companies have registered growth above the Zacks Beverage \u2013 Soft Drinks industry in the year-to-date period. Notably, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have risen 3.3% and 5.2% year to date, respectively, compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 2.9%.\n\nValuation\n\nIn the valuation chart below, we see that KO and PEP have similar forward price-to-earnings multiples. PepsiCo trades at 20.93X, which is below its 5-year median of 23.65X, and Coca-Cola is trading at 21.54X, also below its 5-year median of 23.88X. A lower trading multiple than its average indicates that these stocks have good scope for an upside. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, the Zacks Beverage \u2013 Soft Drinks industry currently trades at a 20.98X forward price-to-earnings multiple, which is essentially above PepsiCo\u2019s multiple and below Coca-Cola\u2019s. Hence, PepsiCo looks relatively cheaper than the broader industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe earnings season is an exciting time to track and reevaluate the stocks in one\u2019s portfolio. While the long-term fundamentals of both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola look promising, PepsiCo has an edge over Coca-Cola post their first-quarter results based on its positive estimate revisions, the Zacks Rank and cheaper valuation.\r\n\r\nHowever, that does not mean that the KO stock has lost sheen. Looking fundamentally, Coca-Cola stands tall amid its non-alcoholic beverage peers. Ideally, PEP and KO are strong long-term plays, as the non-alcoholic beverage industry continues to enjoy strong consumer demand for on-to-go drinks.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Everybody loves dividends, as they provide a passive income stream, limit drawdowns in other positions, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.\n\nAnd when considering dividend-paying stocks, those with a history of consistent payouts are prime considerations, reflecting their commitment to shareholders.\n\nRecently, three companies \u2013 Aflac AFL, American Water Works AWK, and PepsiCo PEP \u2013 have all announced a boost to their quarterly payouts. For those interested in income, let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\n\nAflac\n\nAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company announced a sizable 19% boost to its quarterly payout, bringing the quarterly total to $0.13 per share.\n\nPerhaps to the surprise of some, AFL shares have tracked the S&P 500 almost to a tee over the last decade, gaining 240%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmerican Water Works\n\nAmerican Water Works provides essential water services to millions of customers. The company recently announced an 8% boost to its quarterly payout, bringing the total to $0.76 per share.\n\nAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board, with the company also recently confirming current-year guidance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo is the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products. The company unveiled a 7% boost to its payout, bringing the quarterly total to $1.35 per share.\n\nInvestors stepped up post-earnings following its latest print, with PEP shares moving higher and adding nearly 4% over the last month compared to the S&P 500\u2019s 3.2% decline. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nTargeting dividend-paying stocks is an excellent strategy that investors can deploy.\n\nDividends soften the blow from drawdowns in other positions, provide more than one way to reap a return from an investment, and allow maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.\n\nAnd all three companies above \u2013 Aflac AFL, American Water Works AWK, and PepsiCo PEP \u2013 have recently boosted their payouts.\n\nFor those seeking a reliable income stream, all three deserve serious consideration.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Macroeconomic headwinds are buffeting consumer confidence and bringing volatility especially to high-growth stocks on Wall Street. Therefore, investors look at sectors outside technology, like these three restaurant stocks to buy. The sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience.\n\nConsumer spending at restaurants surging 5% in 2023, up from 4% in 2022. Regardless of inflation, restrained consumer spending and mounting concerns of potential stagflation, analysts still anticipate sustained demand for dining-out experiences.\n\nSo far in 2024, the S&P 500 Restaurant Sub-Indexhas returned around 1.5%. It trails behind the broader S&P 500, which has advanced over 5%. However, the restaurant sub-index showed a better comparative performance in April when volatility on Wall Street picked up considerably.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThus, now is a good time to identify companies with the potential for long-term growth in the restaurant sector. Let\u2019s delve into three such stocks, especially if their prices decline in May, offering better entry points.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) olive garden (dri) sign on front of building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDarden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) operates a portfolio of popular full-service eateries across the U.S. and Canada. Brands include Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen and Yard House. They cater to a range of dining preferences.\n\nThe restaurant giant announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 in late March. Quarterly revenue came in at $3.0 billion, up 6.8% year-over-year (YOY). Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $2.62, up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Elsewhere, investors noted the authorization of a new $1 billion share repurchase program.\n\nYet, the stock has lost 8% year-to-date (YTD), while the dividend yield is a hefty 3.5%. At present, the shares are changing hands at around 16.5 times forward earnings and 1.5 times sales. And Wall Street remains optimistic for the prospects of the restaurant group. The 12-month median price forecast for DRI stock is $181.50. Such an up move could potentially mean a 20% return for buy-and-hold investors.\n\nDave & Buster\u2019s (PLAY) Dave & Buster's (PLAY) logo on a window\n\nSource: Jeff Bukowski/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe entertainment and dining chain Dave & Buster\u2019s (NASDAQ:PLAY), offers a unique twist on restaurants. The business combines a casual eatery with an arcade experience, appealing to families and groups. Owning and operating locations across North America, Dave & Buster\u2019s boasts a recognizable brand and a growing market for \u201ceatertainment.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, management released Q4 and full year 2023 results in early April. Revenue of $599.1 million was up 6.3% compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted net income was $42.0 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $41.8 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nRecently, Dave & Buster\u2019s, in expanding its global footprint, signed a franchise deal to develop two restaurants in the Dominican Republic. This adds to their existing international presence, with franchise agreements in several countries. Meanwhile, recent company headlines show that management is venturing into social betting. It is partnering with gamification technology company Lucra to create a new revenue stream. So, Dave & Buster\u2019s loyalty members can place small bets on arcade games.\n\nSo far in 2024, PLAY stock has lost about 3%, while the shares are trading at 13 times forward earnings and 1.1 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12 month median price forecast is at $76.00 suggesting an upside potential of\u00a045%.\n\nInvesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (PBJ) ETF Investment index funds concept with letter wooden blocks and lots of different currencies, ETFs to buy. Emerging markets ETFs\n\nSource: Eviart / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe National Restaurant Association anticipates industry growth in 2024. Sales are projected to surpass $1 trillion. Moreover, the workforce poised to increase by an additional 200,000, reaching a total employment of 15.7 million.\n\nTherefore, in looking at restaurant stocks to buy, investors should consider the Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ). This ETF focuses on U.S. companies with robust fundamentals. It evaluates factors like quality, value, price and earnings momentum as well as management action.\n\nCurrently, PBJ holds 32 stocks across the food and beverage spectrum. Top holdings include Kroger (NYSE:KR), DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The top ten names account for 46% of its portfolio.\n\nLaunched June 2005, the fund has a market value of approximately $130 million. Since January, PBJ has returned close to 4% and currently offers a 1.5% dividend yield. Meanwhile, the trailing P/E and price-to-book (P/B) ratios stand at 22.24x and 2.13x, respectively. A decline toward the $45 level could offer a better risk/return profile for potential PBJ investors. Finally, investors should note the expense ratio of 0.57%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.16 per share, indicating a change of +3.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.16 points to a change of +7.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.81 indicates a change of +8% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $94.56 billion and $99.11 billion estimates indicate +3.4% and +4.8% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $18.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.61 for the same period compares with $1.50 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.14 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was +5.92%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 ETFs to Buy When the Market Gets Crazy",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds can be your best friend during times of volatility, which brings us to ETFs to buy. Primarily, the casting of a wide net enables you to cover much more ground than you can hope for selecting individual securities.\n\nSecond, the very nature of ETFs help mitigate downside risk. If one idea within the basket tanks, other more compelling names could help pick up the slack. Also, these funds enable you to acquire exposure across multiple industries. This way, you can face market uncertainty with a greater degree of confidence.\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky world out there. Give yourself an advantage with these ETFs to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) The word \"dividends\" written over a blue graph line being drawn by a business person's hand\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Jirsak\n\nWhen faced with uncertainty, it\u2019s a good idea to target companies that provide passive income. Generally, these enterprises tend to be the most stable. After all, those dividends must come from somewhere. Nevertheless, it can still be quite a challenge to decipher which names will win out. With the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEARCA:VIG), the fund takes much of the guesswork out of the equation.\n\nNotably, technology stalwart Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents the top holding of the VIG ETF. To be fair, it\u2019s not the most generous enterprise, with a forward yield of 0.74%. However, the company has been increasing its payout over the last 22 years. Rounding out the top three are fellow tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).\n\nAnother factor that makes the VIG one of the best ETFs to buy is diversification. Technology holds the top weighting at 22.35%. However, the financial and healthcare sectors aren\u2019t too far behind at 20.15% and 16.34%, respectively. Combined with a lowly expense ratio of 0.06%, this Vanguard fund should be on your radar.\n\nUtilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) Miniature house and symbols of public utilities.\n\nSource: Andrii Yalanskyi / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the key reasons why investors ought to consider the utilities sector during market turbulence is the natural monopoly. Technically speaking, nothing prevents a would-be rival from competing against a utility provider. However, high barriers to entry exist, including regulatory frameworks. As such, most don\u2019t even bother, leaving the utility giants entrenched.\n\nStill, it\u2019s difficult to know for sure which utility to buy. So, that\u2019s where the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU) enters front and center stage. The XLU\u2019s top holding is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), a powerhouse in the green and renewable energy space. Rounding out the top three holdings are Southern Company (NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK).\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, there\u2019s not a whole lot of diversification in the XLU \u2013 it\u2019s 100% utilities. However, what\u2019s great about the fund is the geographic diversity. For example, Duke covers the Carolinas, which has seen an influx of millennials. Southern covers, as its name implies, the Southern states.\n\nWith the utility firms providing an excellent source for high dividends, XLU is one of the top ETFs to buy.\n\niShares US Consumer Staples ETF (IYK) A store shelf stocked with various consumer staples.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nConsumer staples represent everyday products that people need (or want). Thus, the sector provides ample protection from volatility. To be sure, if the market decides to tank, the red ink could end up taking everything down. Still, consumer staple specialists tend to be resilient in large part because of the underlying revenue predictability. Sure enough, the iShares US Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK) makes for an intriguing idea for ETFs to buy.\n\nNot surprisingly, the IYK\u2019s top holding is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Fundamentally, P&G offers assurances for investors thanks to its relevant products and longstanding brand awareness. Coming in as number two and three are the beverage giants PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Both should benefit from the trade-down effect as cheap providers of caffeinated products.\n\nWhile the vast majority of the IYK is tied to the consumer defensive space specifically (87.94%), the fund includes modest exposure to healthcare (9.61%) and basic materials (1.78%). It\u2019s not an exciting fund per say. However, it should keep your portfolio upright.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Inflationary pressures are fizzing out, says Coca Cola (KO) CEO James Quincey.\n\n\"Our pricing levels and the input inflation cost levels are normalizing as we see through the year,\" he told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday, after the company posted Q1 earnings.\n\nCoca Cola reported $11.3 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street estimates of $10.96 billion, while its earnings per share of $0.72 also topped expectations of $0.70.\n\nBut it only clocked unit case volume growth of 1% year over year, as prices increased 13% across its segments.\n\nThe company updated its organic revenue growth outlook to 8% to 9%, partially due to anticipated good performance, and partially due to \"intense inflation\" in a select number of countries such as Argentina and Nigeria.\n\n\"There are a set of countries that account for a relatively small percentage of the business in volume terms, that because of the elevated levels of inflation, they drive up both the currency and neutral revenue,\" Quincey explained.\n\nBeyond that, Coca Cola is seeing inflation decelerate, including commodity costs like corn syrup, sugar, and aluminum cans.\n\nCoke's stock is down 3% in the past year, while rival PepsiCo's (PEP) shares have dropped more than 9%.\n\nWhile goods are still much more expensive than pre-pandemic, most consumers have been able to cope with the costs.\n\n\"The US consumers are doing better in the sense that wages are rising relative to inflation and purchasing power is kind of stabilizing out,\" Quincey said. \"The lower income consumers are under a little more pressure, looking looking more clearly for value.\"\n\nPer J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira, the lower income consumer makes up about 20% of Coca Cola's U.S. volumes.\n\nAmericans are still willing to spend on experiences, such as going out to dinner, movies, and theaters, though some are shifting slightly to entertaining at home.\n\nThe pull back is \"partly from...lower income consumers,\" but it's not as big of a discrepancy as seen during COVID, said Quincey.\n\nProduct innovation in its namesake Coca-Cola brand helped drive growth, including having different package sizes like mini cans in the US.

        "content": "By Helen Reid\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Norway's sovereign wealth fund plans to back a shareholder proposal demanding PepsiCo conduct a biodiversity risk assessment to gauge how vulnerable the soft drink and snacks giant's operations are to biodiversity loss.\n\nThe decision by PepsiCo's seventh-largest shareholder adds to signs that biodiversity-related risks to businesses are rising up the agenda for investors.\n\nIt also challenges the PepsiCo board's recommendation to shareholders that they reject the proposal at the annual general meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"The board should account for material sustainability risks facing the company, and the broader environmental and social consequences of its operations and products,\" the fund, which pools revenues from the Norwegian state's oil and gas production, said ahead of the meeting.\n\nPepsiCo's board said a biodiversity assessment is unnecessary and not in the best interests of PepsiCo or its shareholders, pointing to the company's existing reporting and initiatives to support sustainability.\n\nThe $242 billion maker of Pepsi soda, Doritos and Lay's crisps and Quaker oats has a goal of spreading regenerative farming practices - meant to prioritise soil health and protect biodiversity - across 7 million acres by 2030.\n\nThe proposal by Green Century Capital Management says that while PepsiCo has taken \"commendable\" initiatives on sustainability, it may be exposed to unnecessary risks if it doesn't fully assess its dependency on natural systems and seek to limit impacts on the business.\n\n\"PepsiCo must assess and mitigate activities leading to biodiversity loss in its supply chain or risk becoming uninvestable,\" the shareholder said.\n\nGerman asset manager Allianz Global Investors also last week said it would back the biodiversity proposal.\n\nIn its published voting intentions, Norway's sovereign wealth fund also said it would vote against the compensation of PepsiCo's named executive officers.\n\nThe fund has voiced concerns about what it sees as excessive CEO pay at U.S. companies, and voted against PepsiCo executive compensation last year too.\n\nThe fund will also vote against the reelection of PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta, as it believes the roles of chairperson and CEO should be separated.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Ros Russell)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?",
        "content": "Investors might want to bet on PepsiCo (PEP), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for PepsiCo basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor PepsiCo, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for PepsiCo\n\nThis food and beverage company is expected to earn $8.16 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 7.1%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PepsiCo. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.7%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of PepsiCo to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Are Consumer Staples Stocks Lagging  PepsiCo (PEP) This Year?",
        "content": "The Consumer Staples group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers. PepsiCo (PEP) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? A quick glance at the company's year-to-date performance in comparison to the rest of the Consumer Staples sector should help us answer this question.\n\nPepsiCo is a member of the Consumer Staples sector. This group includes 191 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #13. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.\n\nThe Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks. This system has a long record of success, and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months. PepsiCo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nWithin the past quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP's full-year earnings has moved 0.7% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\n\nBased on the most recent data, PEP has returned 3.4% so far this year. In comparison, Consumer Staples companies have returned an average of 1.7%. This shows that PepsiCo is outperforming its peers so far this year.\n\nAnother stock in the Consumer Staples sector, Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 29.3%.\n\nIn Pilgrim's Pride's case, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year increased 21.4% over the past three months. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nLooking more specifically, PepsiCo belongs to the Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which includes 15 individual stocks and currently sits at #81 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, stocks in this group have gained 2.6% this year, meaning that PEP is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\n\nPilgrim's Pride, however, belongs to the Food - Meat Products industry. Currently, this 5-stock industry is ranked #21. The industry has moved +13.6% so far this year.\n\nGoing forward, investors interested in Consumer Staples stocks should continue to pay close attention to PepsiCo and Pilgrim's Pride as they could maintain their solid performance.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About PepsiCo (PEP): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP).\n\nPepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.89, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.89 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 55.6% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in PEP?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $8.16.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Jessica DiNapoli\n\nNEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Chinese shoppers are spending a little more on diapers and some Colgate toothpastes, according to executives at the makers of these products, even as consumers fret about the country's property crisis and faltering economy.\n\nChina's economic slump after the pandemic has weighed on sales at consumer packaged goods companies, who had targeted the world's second-biggest economy as a major source of growth.\n\nInvestors and analysts are keeping close tabs on when the economy starts to significantly improve, which should be a boost for makers of consumer goods.\n\nSome consumer companies like Tide detergent maker Procter & Gamble, Reckitt, which manufactures Dettol cleaning solutions, and food producer PepsiCo are reporting some small signs of stronger spending in China.\n\n\"The Colgate business had a terrific quarter in China,\" said CEO Noel Wallace, adding that sales of the company's premium products like whitening toothpaste are \"robust.\" About 14% of the company's total sales came from its Asia Pacific region, which includes China, last year.\n\nBut Colgate's overall sales volumes in China are still soft, mostly due to rural consumers cutting back, Wallace said.\n\n\"Clearly that consumer is a bit more challenged in China right now,\" he said.\n\nWallace said the company's Darlie brand toothpaste is well-positioned in the longer term to gain market share with rural Chinese shoppers.\n\nReckitt has begun testing livestream shopping, or live video shopping, of Durex condoms in China. On Wednesday, in its conference call with investors, its CEO said Durex condoms in China are \"really working very well for us,\" thanks to new materials and other enhancements.\n\nBut both L'Oreal and P&G flagged problems selling beauty products and cosmetics in China.\n\nL'Oreal on April 18 gave a cautious outlook about China, the world's No. 2 beauty market, with its CEO noting that he is planning for a \"China that is not doing fantastic.\"\n\nP&G Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said in a call with media on April 19 that Chinese consumer sentiment is improving around the company\u2019s high-end Japanese skincare brand, SK-II, although sales of it were down 30% in the last quarter. China is P&G's second-biggest market after the United States.\n\n\u201cWe reached the bottom of the trend and see sentiment improving,\u201d he said, adding the company would focus its marketing on SK-II\u2019s anti-aging claims. The company has said that Chinese consumers shunned the brand over fears about the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan last August, weighing on P&G\u2019s overall financial results.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven excluding sales of SK-II, however, P&G sales in China were down 3% in the quarter that ended March 31, Schulten said. \u201cWe have pockets of strength,\u201d Schulten said, adding that P&G\u2019s diaper and appliance business grew in the country.\n\nAt PepsiCo, which is in the process of opening factories in China and Vietnam, CEO Ramon Laguarta noted that Chinese consumers are being \"very cautious\" and saving a lot.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss what is an annuity for retirement and 15 dividend stocks to buy instead. You can skip our detailed analysis on the subject, and go directly to read What is an Annuity for Retirement? 5 Dividend Stocks to Buy Instead.\n\nFor many Americans approaching retirement age, one of the most significant and potentially anxiety-inducing questions they face is: what is an annuity for retirement? An annuity is an insurance product that provides regular payments and is often included in retirement plans. They are mainly issued by insurance companies, where individuals typically invest a lump sum of money in exchange for a guaranteed income stream for the duration of their life, just like a pension or Social Security benefits. Annuities play an important role in financial planning, considering many Americans are not satisfied with the state of their retirement resources. In fact, a survey conducted by BlackRock revealed that 60% of employees expressed their concern about the possibility of outliving their retirement savings.\n\nDue to high-interest rates and fluctuating market conditions, more and more people are investing in annuities for a reliable source of income during retirement and to mitigate the risk of outliving one\u2019s savings. According to an estimate by an insurance industry group, LIMRA, sales of annuities reached their all-time record high of $385 billion in 2023, showing a remarkable increase of 23% compared to the preceding year. The report further mentioned that the sales set a new record in the fourth quarter of 2023, totaling approximately $115.3 billion. This shows that fixed annuities are a bedrock of retirement planning for millions of Americans, accounting for a significant portion of the nation\u2019s retirement savings. According to a report by Bloomberg, these fixed annuities represent over $3 trillion of the country\u2019s retirement funds.\n\nWhile annuities have remained the top priority of retiree investors, one should keep track of how fast the insurance industry is evolving, with private insurance companies taking over the sector gradually. For this reason, analysts advise investing in stocks and bonds, especially in periods of high-interest rates. Aaron Brown,\u00a0 a former head of financial market research at AQR Capital Management, wrote an article for Bloomberg in 2023 advocating stocks and bonds in retirement planning. He said that diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds have historically delivered a yield of around 4% over the long term, keeping pace with inflation. These portfolios typically have low or no fees and offer high liquidity and flexibility. Over time, they tend to increase in value, even after accounting for inflation, allowing beneficiaries to pass on the legacy to their heirs. Here is what he wrote further:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cInflation-adjusted life annuities have to offer higher rates than 4% for most investors to consider paying the often-high fees, while accepting the loss of liquidity and flexibility (as well as the complexities) of many contracts, and the loss of assets that can be passed along to their heirs.\u201d\n\nWithin investing, dividend growth stocks are known for their reliability, particularly among retirees, as these companies consistently provide investors with steady streams of income. Retirees worried about what is an annuity for retirement should consider investing in dividend growth stocks. We have previously covered strong dividend payers for investors nearing their retirement age in Early Retirement Portfolio: 16 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited. In another article on the subject, we reported how dividend growers have delivered strong returns over the years while providing a hedge against market downturns. The report mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has outperformed the S&P 500 69.34% of the time during down months and around 43.6% of the time during up months.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend growers to consider for retirement as these companies hold decades-long dividend growth streaks and have strong balance sheets. In this article, we will further take a look at some dividend stocks to buy instead of annuities.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI have really hated this earnings season, and it has just begun.\n\nThere have been a few bright spots, no doubt.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta told me it will be a spring and summer of innovation. Think more power-packed Gatorade powders and tablets for workout freaks like yours truly. Let's do this!\n\nSpeaking of workouts, Chipotle (CMG) CFO Jack Hartung told Yahoo Finance that he's OK with the chain being the go-to post fat-burning sessions. He was responding to a new WSJ article that suggested workout buffs are supporting the chain's higher prices.\n\nThen Snowflake's (SNOW) new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, squeezed in an AI product drop ahead of its earnings. He promised that the cloud computing company would be picking up the pace on artificial intelligence innovations this year, aiming to satisfy the Street's appetite for newness.\n\nRamaswamy also called Yahoo Finance \"iconic.\"\n\nWe appreciate that, Sridhar \u2014 and we certainly agree!\n\nBut all in all, I have hated this earnings season.\n\nWhy? Because of all the bad news that is piling up and catching investors off guard.\n\nSurprises have been all over the place.\n\nFor instance, one of the early themes this season is higher-than-expected costs for businesses. And it\u2019s not just UPS (UPS) calling out rising gas prices and the return of fuel surcharges or PepsiCo saying inflation is still in their pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s Chipotle seeing higher tech costs to support new restaurant software. Investments like this (and wage increases) held back profits in the first quarter.\n\nIt\u2019s Meta (META) materially lifting its full-year capital expenditures guidance and hinting at even bigger spending in 2025 \u2014 all because of unknown AI projects. This surprised shareholders and Mark Zuckerberg fans alike.\n\nIt\u2019s Ford (F) losing lots of money on EVs because of higher-than-expected costs.\n\nThen there is the weakness emanating from forward-looking sectors such as truckers and railroads.\n\nTrucker J.B. Hunt (JBHT) had this to say on the economic backdrop: \"We continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure.\" Brutal acknowledgment. The stock was hammered.\n\nOld Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) stated that the last two years have \"felt\" like the 2009 recession.\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC) had this to say this week: \"We expect continued mixed impacts from higher international empty shipments as geopolitical tensions remain elevated, but a weak truck market continues to drive stubbornly low truck rates, which will dampen domestic non-premium Intermodal pricing.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, IBM (IBM) CFO Jim Kavanaugh struck a more cautious note when I asked him about soft sales at its lucrative consulting business.\n\n\"We still see very good demand out in the marketplace around large transformational deals, digital transformation,\" Kavanaugh said. \"We had our largest first quarter in consulting signings in many years. So the demand profile is out there. Our AI bookings for consulting in the first quarter doubled all of 2023.\"\n\n\"But what we're seeing, just given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, is ... a tightening of discretionary spending, no different than Accenture and all the other consulting companies that are impacting the short-term revenue realization.\u201d\n\nMarkets have responded in kind to the dose of badness.\n\n\"I really think this is actually a dip buying opportunity. It's never fun to live through it, but these are normal pullbacks,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\n\nThought I would leave you on a happy note.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy.\n\nAs the latter part of 2022 unfolded, artificial intelligence stocks emerged as a beacon of hope for the market amid rapid and substantial interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, coupled with an inflationary spike triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, with the first quarter of 2024 past us, major stock indexes have surged to unprecedented heights, setting new records. Earlier this March, all three major stock indexes witnessed surges, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a substantial increase of 401.37 points, closing at a notable 39,512.13. Likewise, the S&P 500 surpassed the significant threshold of 5,200 for the first time, recording a rise of 0.89%, while the Nasdaq Composite experienced a notable surge of 1.25%, concluding at an impressive 16,369.41.\n\nA Federal Reserve survey released on April 17 revealed a slight expansion in U.S. economic activity from late February through early April. The survey's findings were disclosed a day after Fed Chair Jerome Powell shifted from previous guidance regarding potential cuts to the benchmark interest rate. Powell emphasized the necessity of maintaining restrictive monetary policy for a prolonged period due to consistently robust inflation readings surpassing expectations. Until recently, Fed policymakers had been encouraged by data indicating a decline in inflation, which had previously surged to a 40-year peak. Despite vigorous economic growth and a low unemployment rate, inflation had been trending towards the Fed's 2% target rate. However, this trend has stalled and reversed, casting doubt on the Fed's ability to enact rate cuts as initially planned. Investors now anticipate the first rate cut to occur in September, with diminishing prospects for a subsequent cut, with the Fed maintaining its policy rate within the current 5.25%-5.50% range following its April 30-May 1 policy meeting, consistent with its stance since July last year.\n\nOf course, many investors and firms still believe this to be nothing more than a minor setback. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) in its recent Weekly Commentary report stated that it anticipates a shift in earnings growth beyond the tech sector, particularly towards industrials and materials. Despite concerns about Middle East tensions affecting crude oil prices and inflation, the firm asserts that the overall performance of the U.S. economy remains robust, citing indicators such as GDP growth, employment numbers, and consumer spending.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee Also: 13 Best Low Volatility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.\n\nIn addition, on a global scale, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its growth forecasts upward by 0.3% from October levels. The IMF now expects global growth to reach 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, similar to the levels experienced in 2023. It foresees \"stronger activity\" from the U.S., China, and other major emerging markets, while weaker activity is predicted in the Euro area. Additionally, the IMF forecasts median inflation to decrease to 2.8% by the end of 2024 and 2.4% in 2025, compared to 4% at the end of 2023.\n\nLow Risk Investing\n\nThe historical outperformance of low risk stocks challenges a fundamental principle of finance theory, which suggests that higher risk is typically associated with higher returns. Surprisingly, academic research has consistently shown that low-volatility stocks have outperformed the market over much of the past century. Unlike conventional wisdom, studies indicate that less volatile stocks tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, partly by minimizing losses during market downturns. With lower exposure to market fluctuations, these stocks may not experience the same highs during bull markets, but they also endure fewer losses during market crashes. Consequently, these \"Steady Eddies\" tend to accumulate more of their gains over the entirety of a market cycle. The report further states that:\n\n\u201cSince 1973, the least volatile quintile of global stocks delivered returns that were one-third higher than the market, 20% less volatility. This performance generated a more than 50% higher Sharpe ratio\u2014or absolute return relative to risk.\u201d\n\nAnother avenue to capitalize on low risk investments involves investing in low volatility ETFs, which function as strategic investment instruments with long-term asset allocation strategies, enabling investors to effectively mitigate risk. Historically, minimum volatility indexes have demonstrated reduced volatility compared to broader market indices. In January of this year, Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar, recommended that young investors focus on constructing diversified portfolios using low cost mutual funds and ETFs instead of individual stocks to minimize risks:\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a single investment type where there is a lot of data to support that, where you\u2019ll have a good outcome, it\u2019s using broad market index funds.\u201d\n\nWith global geopolitical conditions contributing to market volatility, investors would do well to seek refuge in proven safe stocks to protect their investments. In that regard, some of the best low risk stocks to invest include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), among others listed below. 10 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo identify the best long term low risk stocks, we sought stocks with a beta value below 1.0, robust fundamentals, favorable analyst ratings, and positive analyst price targets as of April 17. Further refining our criteria, we excluded stocks with market caps less than $10 billion, and those with unstable dividend payouts. The remaining stocks underwent evaluation using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of elite hedge funds from the fourth quarter of 2023. Our list comprises the top 10 stocks ranked by hedge fund sentiment, arranged in ascending order of hedge fund shareholders.\n\nHedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nBeta Value: 0.77\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates a global network of membership warehouses, known primarily under the \"Costco Wholesale\" brand. These warehouses offer high-quality, brand-name products at significantly lower prices compared to traditional wholesale or retail outlets.\n\nIn its quarterly report ending February 18, 2024, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) announced a non-GAAP EPS of $3.71, surpassing market expectations by $0.07. However, the reported revenue of $58.44 billion fell short of Wall Street estimates by $690 million.\n\nInsider Monkey's fourth-quarter database revealed bullish sentiments from 57 hedge funds towards Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), a decrease from 65 funds in the previous quarter. Fisher Asset Management, led by Ken Fisher, holds the largest position in the company, with 2.8 million shares valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor\u00a0letter:\n\n\u201cCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported solid holiday results and announced a special dividend of $15 per share. Earnings were better than expected driven by better gross margin. Same store sales were 3.9% with solid traffic. Costco also noted better discretionary trends and solid seasonal sales.\u201d\n\nMuch like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) ranks as one of the best long term stocks to invest in.\n\n9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nBeta Value: 0.59\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is widely acknowledged as one of the premier low-risk investments, renowned for its production of the iconic beverage, Coca-Cola. Apart from its flagship product, the company actively engages in the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of a diverse array of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and notably, alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry.\n\nOn March 7, investment advisory firm Argus reaffirmed a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and adjusted the price target to $70 from $67.\n\nAs of December 2023, Insider Monkey's tracking identified 62 hedge funds with stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), an increase from 58 in the prior quarter. The total value of these stakes amounted to nearly $27 billion.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its\u00a0third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n8. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nBeta Value: 0.54\n\nBased in Purchase, Harrison, New York, PepsiCo, Inc.

CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67\n\nBeta Value: 0.55\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a prominent player in the healthcare sector, boasting a vast network of retail pharmacies and clinics nationwide.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy if Inflation Continues to Reign in 2024",
        "content": "Before considering which stocks to buy if inflation continues, it\u2019s good to remember the relationship between\u00a0inflation and interest rates. The latest reading on CPI and PPI shows that the declining inflation rate may be ramping back up.\n\nThe takeaway is that the Fed is less likely to lower interest rates, which puts pressure on equities. But while some stocks will struggle, others are built to shine during rising inflation. These are the companies that deliver the products and services that consumers need to have regardless of what\u2019s happening in the economy.\n\nA common trait of these companies is that they are mature companies with a consistent track record of generating positive revenue and earnings. When these companies\u2019 stock outperforms the market, the companies can pass along that growth to shareholders.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nInvestors seem to have a lot of reasons to talk down PepsiCo\u2019s (NASDAQ:PEP) stock. Until recently, the stock had been lagging behind the broader market due to concerns about declining volume. There was concern over weight-loss drugs eating into the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nBut inflation is a great equalizer. While it\u2019s true that Pepsi has missed on revenue in its last two quarters, earnings are still higher than estimates for the quarter and on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThat speaks to pricing power, which investors should be looking for right now. Consumers may be pulling back, but Pepsi products are still getting its share of the consumer wallet. And when you buy PEP stock, you\u2019re buying a dividend king with a dividend yield of 2.85% and an annual payout of $4 per share.\n\nMany investors could put Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) instead of Pepsi. Both stocks are dividend kings that show no sign of putting their respective streaks in danger. However, PEP stock has outperformed KO stock over the last five years by about 43%.\n\nKenvue (KVUE) Kenvue (KVUE) logo displayed on smartphone with company website in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nKenvue (NYSE:KVUE) is the consumer products spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). When looking at inflation-beating stocks, JNJ would be a solid choice, but Kenvue merits strong consideration.\n\nThe company inherited Johnson & Johnson\u2019s popular consumer brands, including Tylenol, Listerine, and Band-Aid. Yes, Kenvue also has its parent company\u2019s baby powder. Still, it carries none of the settlement costs from the lawsuit settlement after Johnson & Johnson indemnified Kenvue from any of the talc-related liabilities.\n\nIn its first three quarters of reporting as an independent company, Kenvue has posted solid but not spectacular results. However, with many investors having an appetite for tech stocks as opposed to consumer discretionary stocks, KVUE stock is down 11% in its first year since going public.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut stickier inflation allows the company to remind investors why it\u2019s a viable safe-haven stock. And it\u2019s association with Johnson & Johnson also grafts the company onto the list of dividend kings. And KVUE stock already has a yield of over 4%.\n\nKimberly-Clark (KMB) Kimberly Clark (KMB) sign, positioned outside the world headquarters\u2019 main entrance.\n\nSource: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com\n\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) is next up on this list of stocks to buy if inflation continues. And no surprise, the company is another dividend king. The streak is 53 years, counting for Kimberly-Clark, and the dividend has an attractive yield of 3.56%.\n\nLike many consumer products companies, the company has had its ups and downs since 2020, and so has KMB stock. This isn\u2019t a high flyer by any means. The stock is up just over 9% in the last five years. But times of high inflation are a boon to defensive stocks. In the month ending April 24, 2024, KMB stock is up 9.2%, pushing the stock higher for the year.\n\nInflation is also suitable for income investors. Yes, the company is guilty of \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d which has boosted its bottom line. As a consumer, you hate it. As an investor, you like what higher earnings means for the company\u2019s future dividend growth.\n\nCMS Energy (CMS) A 3D illustration of hydrogen molecules.\n\nUtilities are a good place to look for stocks to buy if inflation continues. And a quality stock to consider is CMS Energy (NYSE:CMS) or Consumers Energy. The company operates primarily as a regulated electric and gas utility in Michigan. The company also has a renewable energy business that just announced a partnership with\u00a0Walmart (NYSE:WMT). Consumers Energy will provide clean energy to power 44 Walmart locations in Michigan.\n\nThe company has come to light on the top line in the last four quarters compared with analyst expectations. However, it\u2019s made up for it on the bottom line where it has come in higher year-over-year in each quarter. In the company\u2019s first quarter of 2024, the earnings report raised its guidance for the coming year.\n\nStrong earnings are one reason that CMS stock is a favorite of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha owns company shares through his Berkshire-Hathaway (NSYE:BRK.B) hedge fund.\n\nAltria Group (MO) Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThey may not be right for every portfolio, but sin stocks make great defensive stocks. Altria (NYSE:MO) is one of the world\u2019s leading cigarette manufacturers, and the company has been increasingly moving into smokeless products (e.g., vapes). No matter your personal feelings about these products, there\u2019s no denying that Altria has a significant market share that will only grow.\n\nHowever, a more compelling reason to buy MO stock while inflation is still firmly entrenched is the company\u2019s dividend, which currently has a 9% yield. Like many stocks on this list, Altria is a dividend king that has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years.\n\nAfter a rough 2023, investors may get the message on MO stock. The stock is up more than 7% as of April 25, 2024. And with the stock still down 5% in the last 12 months, there\u2019s plenty of stock price appreciation to go along with that dividend.\n\nAlbertson\u2019s (ACI) ACI stock: the Albertsons logo on the side of a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nIf you don\u2019t do the grocery shopping in your home, you may not appreciate what a savvy Albertson\u2019s (NYSE:ACI) may be. With inflation exacting a stiff price on grocery bills, retail grocery chains have to give consumers a reason beyond price to visit their stores.\n\nThe company instituted a loyalty program that is showing strong YOY growth. It\u2019s also making advancements in its digital marketing program including online ordering with both home delivery and curbside pickup options.\n\nThese programs have allowed Albertson\u2019s to have a consistent top line. However, as is the case with many stocks on this list, the real story is robust bottom line growth. And while Albertson\u2019s is not a dividend king, it does pay a respectable dividend with a yield of 2.41%.\n\nACI stock is down 13% in 2024, some of which is because the regulators still decide if they\u2019ll allow the company\u2019s proposed merger with Kroger (NYSE:KR). More will be known in August, but that would also be a catalyst for the stock.\n\nGenuine Parts Company (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are two solid cases for making Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) one of your stocks to buy if inflation continues. On its earnings call in April, the company acknowledged that it continues to be affected by inflation and higher interest rates.\n\nBut inflation cuts both ways. Many consumers are being priced out of newer vehicles. Or, in some cases, they find that dealers lack the models (i.e., traditional ICE vehicles) they may prefer.\n\nThis creates a situation where consumers try to keep their existing vehicles around for as long as possible. And the latest reading of the CPI showed that auto parts were one area where inflation was the stickiest.\n\nThe second reason is that Genuine Parts is yet another dividend king on this list. The company recently made it 69 consecutive years of increasing dividends. The yield of 2.51% is fairly average. However, the payout ratio of 44% easily supports future growth, particularly when analysts forecast high single-digit earnings growth in the next 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Steady Returns in Any Market",
        "content": "Dividend stocks can be a great way to build wealth. If you are a long-term investor and believe in dividend reinvesting, you could generate above-average returns over a few years. However, the trick is to choose companies that have a steady cash flow and those that believe in rewarding shareholders, no matter how the market moves. If a stock market crash is predicted for the near future, invest in these seven dividend stocks for steady returns, you will continue to generate income while you wait for the market to improve.\n\nThese companies have steady earnings growth and enough liquidity to keep paying dividends. Whether you are investing for your retirement, to leave a legacy, or to cover your monthly expenses, these dividend stocks will ensure you enjoy a considerable amount of cash each year. With that in mind, let\u2019s\u00a0take a\u00a0look at the dividend stocks for steady returns. All of these companies enjoy a yield higher than 2%.\n\nDividend Stocks For Steady Returns: 3M (MMM)\n\nDividend yield-6.61%\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) is ready for a comeback after the healthcare spinoff. The management has made several decisions to ensure that the finances are in place and has\u00a0managed to see\u00a0an improvement in the free cash flow. The company reported a revenue of $8 billion for the fourth quarter and an operating cash flow of $2 billion. It is set to report first-quarter results on April 30.\n\n3M is making significant investments in the\u00a0hydrogen industry to enhance the manufacturing of its electrolyzers and this move could help with future growth. MMM stock is trading for $91 today and it enjoys a dividend yield of 6.61%. It is hard to find a company with a dividend yield as high as 6% in the current market environment.\n\nThe company has paid uninterrupted dividends for over 100 years and there is little doubt that it will stop or reduce them. 3M has seen many market ups and downs and has the potential to thrive through them all.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG)\n\nDividend yield-2.48% Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother dividend stock with over 100 years of dividend payments, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a highly steady and reliable stock to own in market uncertainty. The company holds a strong market share in the industry and\u00a0is known for a range of products that will never go out of demand.\n\nSince it offers products suitable for everyday use, the demand is not impacted by market ups and downs. The company started paying dividends in 1890 and has raised the payout to $1.0065 per share this year. It has hiked dividends for 68 years and enjoys a yield of 2.48%. Trading at $162, the stock is nearing the 52-week high but it is worth your money.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company recently announced the\u00a0quarterly results with\u00a0net sales of $20.2 billion and a 3% rise in organic sales. It returned $3.3 billion in cash to shareholders\u00a0in the form of\u00a0dividends and repurchases. Procter & Gamble has a dividend payout ratio of 56%\u00a0which is\u00a0higher than the sector average.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP)\n\nDividend yield- 2.86% Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nGlobal giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has become a household name today and the company owns a wide range of brands which helps ensure diversification. In the first-quarter results, the company beat earnings, driven by higher prices and growing international sales.\n\nIt saw a higher volume and sales growth in the international markets which led to a 2.3% rise in sales to hit $18.25 billion. The management reiterated the guidance for the year and is expecting the organic revenue to increase by 4%.\n\nTrading at $176, PEP stock is up 2% year-to-date and enjoys a dividend yield of 2.86%. The company has increased dividends for over 50 years and announced that it will increase the annual dividend by 7% starting June. With Pepsi, there is low risk and high return potential.\n\nBarclays analyst has a price target of $185 for the stock with an overweight rating while Jefferies analyst has a buy rating with a price target of $209.\n\nPfizer (PFE)\n\nDividend yield- 6.65% blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been struggling over the past year due to the massive drop in the sales of coronavirus vaccine. However, investors need to\u00a0keep in mind\u00a0that Pfizer is not limited to the vaccine and it was a successful business even before the pandemic hit us. The pharma company might be down today but there is\u00a0a lot\u00a0to look forward to.\n\nCurrently, Pfizer has 34 programs in phase 2 trials and 31 programs in phase 3 trials. It is also spending a\u00a0huge amount\u00a0of money on the research and development of cancer drugs which could be a game-changer for the business. The management thinks that in the next six years, they will have eight blockbuster drugs.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be impressed with the company if you looked at its finances now. Do not expect an immediate improvement in the top or bottom line but if you want to make passive income, PFE stock has a dividend yield of 6.65%. Trading at $25 today, the stock is a solid buy and the eventual progress on the clinical trials will take it higher but you will have to remain patient. Take home a steady income while you wait for big rewards.\n\nDividend Stocks For Steady Returns: Chevron (CVX)\n\nDividend yield-3.94% Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper building\n\nSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith soaring oil prices, Chevron (NYSE:CVX)\u00a0looks like a no-brainer buy now. The oil and gas giant is a cash flow machine with a strong upstream and downstream business. Due to its exposure to oil in the upstream production segment, Chevron is directly impacted by the soaring prices which leads to a higher revenue and margin.\n\nEven if the market crashes, Chevron can survive. However, oil prices will continue to remain strong due to the Middle East turmoil. In the\u00a0fourth-quarter results, the company saw a revenue of\u00a0$47.18 billion and the EPS stood at $3.45. The company returned $26.3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2023.\n\nChevron expects the production to increase 4% to 7% this year which will boost the revenue. Trading at $165 today, the stock is on an upward rally. The upcoming results could boost the stock higher. With a dividend yield of 3.94% and a dividend payout ratio of 57%, there is room for growth.\u00a0Analysts are bullish on the stock before the earnings.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nDividend yield-3.08% Engineers in yellow jackets and hard hats looking at a laptop in a workshop\n\nOne of the largest energy companies in the world, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is a blend of two businesses-a utility business and a renewable energy business. The company is steadily expanding its market share and is an industry leader. A dividend aristocrat, NextEra Energy recently reported results and maintained a dividend hike of 10% for 2024.\n\nIt has a strong reputation for rewarding shareholders and its future looks bright. NEE managed to add 2,765 megawatts of new renewables and storage capacity to the portfolio in the quarter. Its net income stood at $1.10 per share and the management maintained the annual guidance.\n\nNextEra Energy also expects to grow the dividends at 10% annually through at least 2026. As the demand for renewable energy soars, NextEra could be in a stronger position and we may\u00a0be able to\u00a0see higher dividend payouts. Trading at $66 today, NEE stock has a dividend yield of 3.08%. It is one of the best dividend stocks for steady returns to buy this year. Several analysts raised the price target of the stock after the quarterly results.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD)\n\nDividend yield-2.42% McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nFast food giant McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) is a strong blue-chip stock to add to your portfolio.\u00a0No matter\u00a0the market situation, MCD continues to report impressive numbers due to its franchise business model. It aims to\u00a0take the number of\u00a0McDonald\u2019s franchises from 41,000 to 50,000 by 2027. Fundamentally, the company is in a strong position with a 37% rise in net income in 2023 and a 10% increase in sales.\n\nSince it does not own all the restaurants\u00a0across the globe, it manages to keep the operating costs down while ensuring steady returns through fees and royalties. However, the stock has been under pressure lately due to the high prices. The company is working on making changes to bring back the customers.\n\nAny dip in MCD stock is a chance to buy. The dividend aristocrat has a yield of 2.42%. Trading at $275 today, the stock is down 7% YTD but I think this slump will not last long and the upcoming results could lead the stock to rally.\n\nMCD is a highly defensive stock to buy and hold\u00a0for the long term. As consumer spending improves, we could see the restaurant stock soar to new highs.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Is It Time To Buy These Beaten Down Dividend Stocks?\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAmid the growing volatility in the stock market, as the macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical tensions pile on, investors are increasingly being drawn towards high-paying dividend stocks. These stocks often emerge as an attractive option for those seeking a balance of income and potential appreciation.\n\nHowever, as investors focus on mega-cap tech companies following their stellar first-quarter earnings report this earnings season, industry stalwarts and well-respected dividend stocks have taken a back seat. With Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumping to nearly 25% so far this year, these beaten-down dividend stocks might be some of the safest bets right now.\n\nPepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has carved a name for itself in the global beverage industry and is long regarded as one of the safest investment bets. Nonetheless, in the era of artificial intelligence, the stalwart has failed to garner adequate investor attention, as evidenced by PEP shares\u2019 7.4% decline over the past year.\n\nThe company currently pays $5.06 in dividends annually, yielding 2.86% on its current share price. PepsiCo is a Dividend Aristocrat as well, having raised its payouts for 51 consecutive years. Interestingly, PepsiCo\u2019s annual dividends have risen at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% over the past five years.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s diversified portfolio might cushion the blow amid increased headwinds, as its snacks segment, including brands like Lay\u2019s and Doritos, remain budget-friendly household favorites. With a history of consistent dividends, PepsiCo might be a sweet spot for those eyeing long-term stability.\n\nAnalysts forecast PepsiCo\u2019s share price to recover in the near term as well, as Jefferies has a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on PEP stock with a price target of $209, indicating a potential upside of nearly 20%. Wedbush also has an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on PEP with a price target of $195, indicating a potential upside of over 10%.\n\nCheck out:The New Pepsi Challenge: A Dividend Stock Showdown Between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo\n\nBCE\n\nDown over 31% over the past year, shares of BCE Inc. (NYSE:BCE), Canada\u2019s largest telecom company, is certainly not doing well.\n\nHowever, the telecom giant\u2019s dividend profile is highly enticing, as it pays $2.91 in dividends annually, yielding a whopping 8.83% on its current share price.\n\nWhile the telecom industry faces regulatory pressures and technological disruptions, BCE\u2019s position as a leading Canadian telecommunications company is hard to ignore. Its robust infrastructure and steady cash flows from essential services like the Internet and mobile make it an attractive option for income-seeking investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a staggering compounded annual growth rate of 10.9% per annum over the past five years, BCE\u2019s robust dividend policy may entice investors seeking income stability.\n\nUnited Parcel Service\n\nThe Atlanta-based global shipping giant United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has faced several challenges over the past year, leading its shares to plummet by over 18% over this period.\n\nNevertheless, its dividend metrics are turning heads. United Parcel Service maintains an annual dividend payout of $6.52 per share per annum, translating to a dividend yield of 4.42% on its current share price.\n\nAs e-commerce continues to thrive, UPS\u2019s essential role in the supply chain positions it as a potential long-term investment opportunity. Analysts are currently bullish on UPS, as both Deutsche Bank and HSBC have a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock. Deutsche Bank has a price target of $179 on UPS, indicating a potential upside of nearly 22%. HSBC, on the other hand, maintains its price target on UPS stock at $170, reflecting a nearly 15% potential upside.\n\nHigh Yield, Hold the Volatility\n\nWhile these stocks offer the potential for significant upside, the fact that they\u2019re beaten down in the first place demonstrates the risks associated with investing in dividend stocks for passive income.\n\nIf you're intrigued by the idea of generating reliable passive income but want to explore opportunities beyond the stock market, consider these two alternative investment platforms:\n\nArrived Homes: This platform allows you to invest in rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for steady rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With an average annualized dividend yield of 4.2% and the backing of notable investors like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes is worth exploring. Click here to explore available properties on the platform.\n\nCityfunds Yield Fund: The Cityfunds Yield fund offers investors a target annualized yield of 8% (with a guaranteed floor of 7%) by investing in a diversified pool of collateralized real estate loans.

        "title": "Understanding PepsiCo (PEP) Reliance on International Revenue",
        "content": "Did you analyze how PepsiCo (PEP) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending March 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this food and beverage company, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n\nThe global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\n\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n\nUpon examining PEP's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $18.25 billion, marking an increase of 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. We will next turn our attention to dissecting PEP's international revenue to get a clearer picture of how significant its operations are outside its main base.\n\nA Closer Look at PEP's Revenue Streams Abroad\n\nOf the total revenue, $1.94 billion came from Africa, Middle East and South Asia during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 10.6%. This represented a surprise of +2.29% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $1.89 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $1.62 billion, or 5.8%, and $2.01 billion, or 11.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n\nDuring the quarter, Latin America contributed $3.97 billion in revenue, making up 21.7% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $3.85 billion, this meant a surprise of +2.94%. Looking back, Latin America contributed $3.06 billion, or 11%, in the previous quarter, and $3.37 billion, or 18.9%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAsia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region generated $1.45 billion in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 8.0% of the total. This represented a surprise of -5.17% compared to the $1.53 billion projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region accounted for $1.22 billion (4.4%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $1.48 billion (8.3%) to the total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nEurope accounted for 23.1% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $4.22 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -2.23%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.31 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe contributed $3.7 billion (13.3%) and $4.26 billion (23.9%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets\n\nIt is projected by analysts on Wall Street that PepsiCo will post revenues of $22.75 billion for the ongoing fiscal quarter, an increase of 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. The expected contributions from Africa, Middle East and South Asia, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region and Europe to this revenue are 6.7%, 13.6%, 5% and 15.5%, translating into $1.52 billion, $3.09 billion, $1.13 billion and $3.51 billion, respectively.\n\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $94.59 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 3.4% from the year before. The revenues from Africa, Middle East and South Asia, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region and Europe are expected to make up 6.5%, 13.5%, 5.2% and 14.7% of this total, corresponding to $6.17 billion, $12.76 billion, $4.9 billion and $13.91 billion respectively.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe dependency of PepsiCo on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\n\nIn a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.\n\nAt Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\n\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\n\nAt the moment, PepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying that its performance may align with the overall market trend in the upcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nA Look at PepsiCo's Recent Stock Price Performance\n\nThe stock has witnessed an increase of 1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's a decrease of 3.2%. In the same interval, the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, to which PepsiCo belongs, has registered a decrease of 0.2%. Over the past three months, the company's shares saw an increase of 2.9%, while the S&P 500 increased by 3.5%.

        "title": "The New Pepsi Challenge: A Dividend Stock Showdown Between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo",
        "content": "The New Pepsi Challenge: A Dividend Stock Showdown Between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nRemember the Pepsi Challenge? The iconic marketing campaign where people were invited to participate in a blind taste test, choosing their favorite between Coca-Cola and Pepsi? Well, we\u2019re bringing that concept back, but with a twist. Instead of comparing the taste of these two beverage giants, we\u2019re putting their stocks to the test as dividend investments.\n\nWe\u2019ll call them \u201cBeverage Stock A\u201d and \u201cBeverage Stock B\u201d to keep things impartial. Let\u2019s see how Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) stack up against each other in terms of historical performance, dividend growth, current yield, dividend safety and analyst price targets.\n\nHistorical Performance\n\nOver the past 10 years, Beverage Stock A has seen a price increase of 50.96%, while Beverage Stock B has more than doubled that with a 107.99% rise. When it comes to total return, which includes dividends, Stock A has delivered a respectable 107.7%, but Stock B has blown it out of the water with a 176.7% return.\n\nWinner: Beverage Stock B\n\nCurrent Yield\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the highest current income, Stock A has a slight edge with a 3.15% dividend yield, compared to Stock B\u2019s 2.85%.\n\nWinner: Beverage Stock A\n\nDividend Growth\n\nBoth stocks have a solid track record of increasing their dividends, but one has been more generous than the other. Stock A has a 10-year dividend growth rate (CAGR) of 5%, while Stock B has been growing its payout at an impressive 8.35% annually over the same period.\n\nWinner: Beverage Stock B\n\nDividend Safety\n\nTo assess the safety of these dividends, we can look at the cash dividend payout ratio (TTM). Stock A is paying out 81.58% of its earnings as dividends, while Stock B has a payout ratio of 94.46%. While both ratios are on the high side, Stock A appears to have a bit more breathing room.\n\nWinner: Beverage Stock A\n\nAnalyst Price Targets\n\nNow, let\u2019s see what the experts think about these two stocks. The latest analyst ratings for Stock A come from JP Morgan, Barclays, and Argus Research, with an average price target implying a 9.92% upside. Stock B\u2019s most recent ratings are from Barclays, JP Morgan, and Wedbush, with an average price target suggesting a 6.49% upside.\n\nWinner: Beverage Stock A\n\nThe Big Reveal\n\nSo, which of these iconic beverage companies do you think is the best dividend stock? Stock A or Stock B? Scroll down to leave a comment with your guess before reading on.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nAlright, time to reveal the truth. Beverage Stock A is none other than the iconic Coca-Cola, while Beverage Stock B is its longtime rival, PepsiCo.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola has always been the more popular soft drink, and it\u2019s also been the more popular dividend stock, partly thanks to its status as one of Warren Buffett\u2019s top holdings. In fact, Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway owns a staggering 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, worth over $23.5 billion and generating $776 million in annual dividends.\n\nThis popularity is reflected in the trading volume as well. Coca-Cola\u2019s 30-day average daily volume is 14.2 million shares, more than double PepsiCo\u2019s 6.07 million.\n\nBut as the Pepsi Challenge has shown time and time again, popularity doesn\u2019t always equate to preference. PepsiCo has outperformed Coca-Cola in terms of price appreciation, total return, and dividend growth over the past decade.\n\nSo, which stock is the winner for you? Just like in the Pepsi Challenge, the answer is a matter of personal preference. Some investors might prioritize current yield and dividend safety, favoring Coca-Cola. Others might be swayed by PepsiCo\u2019s superior growth and total return.\n\nIn the end, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are solid dividend stocks with strong brands and loyal customer bases. The key is to choose the one that best aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time for the real challenge: deciding whether to buy a Coke or a Pepsi to enjoy while you ponder your next investment decision.\n\nLooking for the Ultimate High Yield Investments?\n\nIf you\u2019re intrigued by the idea of generating reliable passive income but want to explore opportunities beyond the stock market, consider these two alternative investment platforms:\n\nArrived Homes: This platform allows you to invest in rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for steady rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nPepsiCo to hold its Annual General Meeting on 1st of May Total pay for CEO Ramon Laguarta includes US$1.69m salary The total compensation is 143% higher than the average for the industry PepsiCo's total shareholder return over the past three years was 33% while its EPS grew by 7.2% over the past three years\n\nCEO Ramon Laguarta has done a decent job of delivering relatively good performance at PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) recently. This is something shareholders will keep in mind as they cast their votes on company resolutions such as executive remuneration in the upcoming AGM on 1st of May. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.\n\nView our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nHow Does Total Compensation For Ramon Laguarta Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?\n\nOur data indicates that PepsiCo, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$243b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$34m for the year to December 2023. That's a notable increase of 19% on last year. We think total compensation is more important but our data shows that the CEO salary is lower, at US$1.7m.\n\nOn comparing similar companies in the American Beverage industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, we found that the median total CEO compensation was US$14m. Hence, we can conclude that Ramon Laguarta is remunerated higher than the industry median. What's more, Ramon Laguarta holds US$33m worth of shares in the company in their own name, indicating that they have a lot of skin in the game.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$1.7m US$1.6m 5% Other US$32m US$27m 95% Total Compensation US$34m US$28m 100%\n\nSpeaking on an industry level, nearly 13% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 87% is other remuneration. PepsiCo has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance. ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at PepsiCo, Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nOver the past three years, PepsiCo, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 7.2% per year. Its revenue is up 4.4% over the last year.\n\nWe'd prefer higher revenue growth, but we're happy with the modest EPS growth. So there are some positives here, but not enough to earn high praise. Looking ahead, you might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for the company's future earnings..\n\nHas PepsiCo, Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nMost shareholders would probably be pleased with PepsiCo, Inc. for providing a total return of 33% over three years. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo Conclude...\n\nPepsiCo primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. However, if the board proposes to increase the compensation, some shareholders might have questions given that the CEO is already being paid higher than the industry.\n\nCEO compensation is a crucial aspect to keep your eyes on but investors also need to keep their eyes open for other issues related to business performance. That's why we did some digging and identified 3 warning signs for PepsiCo that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this freelist of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "content": "Pepsi Tops Estimates Despite A Weakened Domestic Market\n\nOn Tuesday, Pepsi Co Inc (NASDAQ: PEP) showed it managed to navigate\u00a0weaker U.S. demand\u00a0that was the result of\u00a0Quaker Oats recalls and backlash to higher prices for its drinks and snacks.\u00a0But despite delivering better than expected earnings and revenue for its first quarter, Pepsi shares dipped about 2% upon the report as Wall Street watched at other things, such as a struggling domestic market.\n\nFirst quarter highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on March 23rd, Pepsi reported that revenue grew\u00a02.3% to $18.25 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$18.07 billion.\u00a0When\u00a0acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange\u00a0are put aside, organic revenue rose\u00a02.7%.\n\nPepsi earned a\u00a0net income attributable to the company of $2.04 billion\u00a0while adjusted earnings per share of\u00a0$1.61\u00a0also surpassed LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$1.52.\n\nVolume is still under pressure.\n\nStripping\u00a0out pricing and currency changes to\u00a0truly\u00a0reflect demand,\u00a0the beverage segment\u00a0reported flat volume\u00a0while food division\u00a0saw its volume decrease 0.5%. Besides higher prices pressuring volume,\u00a0recalls of\u00a0Quaker Foods cereals and bars only worsened\u00a0the problem by denting the organic volume by about 1%. The recall due to potential salmonella contamination was first issued in December, and then it got further widened in January. The production at the plant tied to recalls has already ceased but Pepsi will\u00a0close\u00a0it in\u00a0June. As a result, the North American Quaker Food division\u2019s\u00a0volume\u00a0plummeted\u00a022%.\n\nThe domestic market is struggling the most.\n\nNorth American divisions\u00a0reported declines across unit. The\u00a0beverage unit\u00a0contracted\u00a05%, followed by\u00a0Frito-Lay\u2019s 2% decline. But, the situation seems brighter outside the U.S.\u00a0Asia-Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and China region reported\u00a0snacks volume grew\u00a012%, while Europe reported\u00a0beverage volumes\u00a0increased 7%, followed by a 2% rise in snack volumes.\n\nPepsi reiterated its full year outlook.\n\nFor 2024, Pepsi guided for\u00a0organic revenue\u00a0growth of at least\u00a04%\u00a0along with a rise of at least 8% of\u00a0core constant currency earnings per share.\n\nPepsi continues to fight for market share, along with its rivals like The Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO). On Tuesday, Coca Cola unveiled it entered into\u00a0five-year strategic partnership\u00a0with no other than Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Together, Coca Cola and Microsoft will work to accelerate cloud and generative AI development. Under the agreement, Coca Cola committed\u00a0$1.1 billion. Coca Cola will take advantage of the\u00a0Copilot\u00a0that\u00a0Microsoft 365\u00a0developed to boost workplace productivity. More importantly, Coca Cola gained the opportunity to use AI solutions that Microsoft is heavily betting on in order to boost innovation across all of its business areas, so Pepsi should watch its back as the famous taste battle is about to expand to new fronts and across new\u00a0dimensions.\n\nStory continues\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Will Keep Going Up During the Next Downturn",
        "content": "The next economic downturn might be closer than you think. So, it\u2019s a good idea to, at least, look at stocks for the next downturn. For one, the recent inflation report came in hotter than expected, with core inflation stubbornly refusing to cool down despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s best efforts to tame it. Of course, one or two hot inflation prints do not necessarily make a trend, as the central bank would have you believe. But if we keep seeing inflation stick around, it could spell trouble for the markets.\n\nThe Fed had penciled in three rate cuts for 2024, but many\u00a0now\u00a0doubt that will happen. Still, with this being an election year, I expect at least one rate cut. Regardless,\u00a0the combination of\u00a0persistent inflation and the recent selloff in red-hot AI stocks could be the perfect recipe for a market downturn.\n\nIf you\u2019re bracing for choppy waters ahead, it\u2019s time to batten down the hatches and add some ballast to your portfolio. Here are seven stocks for the next downturn.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nTJX (NYSE:TJX) is an American retail behemoth that operates a chain of off-price department stores. Their secret sauce?\u00a0Offering high-quality, fashionable, brand-name, and designer merchandise at prices\u00a0that are\u00a0typically 20% to 60% below what full-price retailers charge.\u00a0This business model is a recession-proof goldmine.\n\nWhen the economy hits the skids, consumers tend to tighten their belts and cut back on discretionary spending. But let\u2019s be\u00a0real\u00a0\u2013 we all need a little retail therapy now and then. That\u2019s where TJX comes in, providing a guilt-free indulgence for bargain hunters. As other retailers struggle, TJX\u2019s doors stay open, welcoming frugal fashionistas with open arms.\n\nThe company\u2019s recent performance speaks volumes. Despite the volatile macroeconomic landscape, TJX has been firing on all cylinders, with the stock up\u00a0a cool\u00a020% over the past year. That\u2019s not too shabby for an apparel play. Analysts are projecting EPS growth of around 10% annually through 2030, with mid-single-digit sales growth to boot. TJX has\u00a0also been outperforming\u00a0expectations recently.\u00a0With a 1.6% dividend yield to sweeten the deal, this stock is\u00a0a\u00a0compelling\u00a0buy.\n\nWaste Management (WM) person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR\n\nWaste Management (NYSE:WM) is a name that\u00a0pretty much\u00a0says it all.\u00a0This company is in the business of, well,\u00a0managing waste. It is a sector that\u2019s about as recession-proof as they come.\u00a0After all, trash doesn\u2019t take a break\u00a0just\u00a0because the economy hits a rough patch.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite its unglamorous line of work, WM has been an unlikely outperformer, with the stock up a solid 26% over the past year. Even better, there\u2019s plenty of upside potential on the horizon, thanks to the infrastructure boom and the company\u2019s pricing power. Throw in a 1.44% dividend yield, and\u00a0you\u2019ve got\u00a0a recipe for steady returns, even in turbulent times.\n\nBut WM isn\u2019t just resting on its laurels. The company\u00a0is investing\u00a0heavily in growth initiatives like recycling and renewable\u00a0energy. It\u2019s also returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend increases. Analysts are forecasting a rise in earnings per share from $7 to $12.8 by 2030, with revenue growth averaging well above 6% annually over the same period. For a \u201cboring\u201d company, those are solid\u00a0numbers that\u2019ll keep the stock compounding for years to come.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH) Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is a leading\u00a0provider of\u00a0consulting, analysis, and engineering\u00a0services\u00a0to both public and private sector organizations.\u00a0What sets BAH apart is its focus on cutting-edge technologies like AI, quantum computing, 5G, and digital twins. All are areas where the company is delivering impactful solutions for the U.S. government and industry heavyweights.\n\nThis isn\u2019t your typical tech stock. BAH generates\u00a0a whopping\u00a095% of its revenue from the government. This is a revenue stream that\u2019s about as sticky as they come. And with the government doubling down on AI, data platforms, and other emerging technologies, that tap shows no signs of running dry anytime soon. These government contracts are a veritable goldmine of recurring revenue, making BAH one of the most recession-resistant stocks.\n\nThe stock\u2019s performance speaks for itself: BAH is up\u00a051.3% over the past year,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u2019s even\u00a0throwing in a 1.4% dividend yield for good measure.\u00a0In Q4 2023, revenue growth clocked in at a robust 12.9% year-over-year, and analysts are projecting 15% year-over-year sales growth for the full year 2024.\n\nMarsh & McLennan (MMC) man in suit holding a tablet with graphic above showing oversold stocks to buy\n\nSource: undefined undefined / Getty Images\n\nMarsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) is a global professional services juggernaut specializing in risk, strategy, and people solutions. With its four main businesses \u2013 Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Mercer, and Oliver Wyman. MMC provides a comprehensive suite of services, from risk management and insurance to strategic advisory and human capital solutions. This diversified business model is a recipe for resilience in any economic climate.\n\nThe insurance industry is often touted as recession-proof, and MMC is no exception. While no company is entirely immune to economic headwinds, this stock represents a low-risk investment that\u2019s poised to weather any storm. Even in the depths of a downturn, organizations will continue to seek MMC\u2019s expertise in mitigating risks and navigating turbulent waters.\n\nThe stock has delivered a staggering 115% return over the past five years, handily outpacing even the tech-heavy Nasdaq. And the best may be yet to come, with analysts projecting annual EPS growth of around 10% and mid-single-digit sales growth on the horizon.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) needs no introduction. This beverage and snack behemoth is a must-have for any portfolio seeking ballast against market volatility. Sure, PepsiCo\u2019s products may be classified as \u201cdiscretionary\u201d on paper, but when was the last time you went to the grocery store and didn\u2019t spot a Pepsi, Lay\u2019s, or Gatorade product in your cart?\n\nWhile PepsiCo\u2019s stock may dip during a recession (as all stocks tend to do), it\u2019s virtually guaranteed to bounce back with a vengeance. This company is too entrenched in our daily lives, too ubiquitous on store shelves, to be derailed for long. And with a juicy 3% dividend yield backed by 52 consecutive years of payout hikes, PepsiCo is the ultimate \u201cbuy and forget\u201d play.\n\nThe recent underperformance only adds to the allure, making these shares a bargain for long-term investors. I see little downside risk from here \u2013 just a steady compounder that will keep chugging along, recession or not. It is thus one of the most recession-resistant stocks.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the largest publicly traded electricity company in the U.S. by market cap. I see the recent slide as a buying opportunity.\n\nNextEra is poised to be a prime beneficiary of the clean energy transition, using low-cost renewables. With a strategy built on cost and efficiency improvements, NextEra is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing green energy revolution, even as tax credits begin to fade.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not overlook that juicy dividend yield, which currently sits well above NextEra\u2019s historical average \u2013 usually a telltale sign of undervaluation. Combine that with the company\u2019s financial strength and stability relative to its peers, and you\u2019ve got a premium stock trading at a discount.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS) General Mills Cereal, GIS stock\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS) is a quintessential \u201cboring\u201d stock that\u2019s perfect for long-term compounders. As a leading manufacturer of beloved consumer brands like Cheerios, Betty Crocker, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs, General Mills is about as recession-proof as they come.\n\nThe stock has had its fair share of corrections and volatility (as all stocks do), but its recent 20% pullback from the highs presents a compelling entry point. Well-established, profitable businesses like GIS have a knack for bouncing back, and I see little reason for this tried-and-true name to buck that trend.\n\nWith a forward dividend yield of 3.33% and a dividend buyback ratio in the top 9% of its peers, General Mills offers a compelling income stream and safety.

GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with PEP.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Can you provide some perspective on PepsiCo's strong international performance over the last few quarters and its sustainability moving forward? A: Ramon Luis Laguarta, Chairman & CEO of PepsiCo, highlighted the company's satisfaction with its international performance, attributing it to strategic investments in both snacks and beverages across various markets. He emphasized ongoing efforts to scale businesses in populous and profitable growth markets, leveraging strong innovation and local market understanding. Laguarta expressed confidence in the continued growth and profitability of PepsiCo's international segment, which is already a significant part of the company's future growth strategy.\n\nQ: What are the key factors affecting Frito-Lay's operating margins, and what are the expectations for margin expansion? A: James T. Caulfield, Executive VP & CFO, explained that Frito-Lay's Q1 profit was impacted by high growth in the previous year and investment timing. He indicated a gradual improvement in margins is expected, emphasizing the importance of reinvesting in the business to sustain growth. CEO Ramon Laguarta added that the strategic goal for Frito-Lay is to grow the salty savory category and increase market share, which would positively impact overall PepsiCo margins.\n\nQ: How are Gatorade and Mountain Dew performing, especially with the observed volume weaknesses? A: CEO Ramon Laguarta addressed concerns about Gatorade and Mountain Dew, noting that both brands gained market share in their categories during Q1. He mentioned weather impacts on Gatorade but reassured that strategic investments and operational improvements are expected to stabilize and enhance performance. The successful launch of Baja Blast as a permanent flavor has also positively impacted Mountain Dew by attracting new consumers.\n\nQ: Can you discuss the strategic adjustments being made in the PBNA segment to improve profitability? A: Ramon Laguarta explained that PBNA is focusing on deemphasizing less profitable product and package combinations and enhancing revenue management to deliver a more precise consumer value proposition.

A: CEO Ramon Laguarta described the global consumer as resilient, supported by low unemployment and rising wages. He noted particular caution among Chinese consumers and budget-conscious behavior among lower-income U.S. consumers. CFO James T. Caulfield added that PepsiCo's commodity outlook remains stable due to diversified sourcing and forward purchasing strategies, which help manage inflation effectively.\n\nQ: Could you provide an update on the CELSIUS agreement and PepsiCo's broader energy drink strategy? A: Ramon Laguarta confirmed the strength of the partnership with CELSIUS, emphasizing its strategic alignment and benefits for both companies. He highlighted the role of the partnership in enhancing PepsiCo's distribution scale, particularly in channels requiring higher volumes, and reiterated the company's commitment to growing within the profitable energy drink category.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

The company\u2019s results have been mainly aided by improvements in its international business, which delivered significant volume growth and organic revenue growth of 9%.\r\n\r\nPEP noted that each of its international businesses recorded at least high-single-digit organic revenue growth, along with organic volume growth across most units. Within the international business, organic revenues increased 9% for the convenient food business and 10% for the beverages category.\r\n\r\nThe results also reflect gains from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends.\r\n\r\nShares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 6.6% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 2.6% growth.

In constant currency, core earnings improved 7% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The company\u2019s reported EPS of $1.48 rose 6% year over year in the quarter. The impact of currency rates on the quarter\u2019s EPS was neutral.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $18,250 million rose 2.3% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18,155 million. Revenues gained from an improved price/mix in the reported quarter, offset by a unit volume decline of 0.5% for the convenient food business and a flat unit volume for the beverage business. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 0.5%.\r\n\r\nOn an organic basis, revenues grew 2.7% year over year, driven by growth across categories and geographies, except for QFNA. The consolidated organic volume was down 2%, while effective net pricing improved 5% in the first quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments, except for QFNA and AMESA.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted year-over-year organic revenue growth of 3.7% for the first quarter, with an 8.1% gain from price/mix and a 4.4% decline in volume.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc.

The reported gross margin contracted 43 basis points (bps), whereas the core gross margin expanded 37 bps.\r\n\r\nWe anticipated the core gross margin to be flat at 55.3% in the first quarter. In dollar terms, core gross profit was expected to increase 1.9% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe company reported an operating income of $2,717 million rose 3.3% year over year. The core operating income grew 4.9% year over year to $2,939 million and the core constant-currency operating income improved 10%. The reported operating margin expanded 16 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 40 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted core SG&A expenses of $7.3 billion, which indicated year-over-year growth of 2.7%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses were anticipated at 39.9%, suggesting a 30-bps rise from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expected a core operating margin of 15.4%, implying a 30-bps decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\n\nStory continues\n\nSegmental Details\n\nThe company witnessed reported and organic revenue growth across all operating segments, except for QFNA. Revenues in the QFNA segment were impacted by certain product recalls and tough revenue growth comparison with the prior year.\r\n\r\nRevenues, on a reported basis, improved 2% each year over year in the FLNA and AMESA segments. Also, reported revenues rose 16% in Latin America, 1% in PBNA, 3% in Europe and 6% in the APAC segment. Organic revenues increased 2% for FLNA, 1% for PBNA, 8% for Latin America, 10% for Europe, 7% for AMESA and 11% for the APAC segment. However, revenues declined 24% for the QFNA segment on both reported and organic basis.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe company ended first-quarter 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $8,047 million, long-term debt of $37,707 million, and shareholders\u2019 equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $19,190 million.\r\n\r\nNet cash used in operating activities was $1,041 million as of Mar 23, 2024, compared with $392 million used as of Mar 25, 2023.\n\nOutlook\n\nPepsiCo has retained its view for 2024. The company expects organic revenue growth of at least 4% for 2024. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nPEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and the core EPS by 1 percentage point in 2024, based on the current rates. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2024.\r\n\r\nBased on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects a core EPS of at least $8.15 for 2024. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $7.62 reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return a value worth $8.2 billion in 2024, including $7.2 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1 billion in 2024.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss These Better-Ranked Stocks\n\nWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, Vita Coco Company COCO and Diageo DEO.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola FEMSA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

        "title": "Pre-Markets Up, Q1 Earnings Beats for GM, UPS, Pepsi",
        "content": "Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024\r\n\r\nAs Q1 earnings season rolls along, market outlooks seem sunnier. For one thing, we\u2019re not seeing many bleak, bad misses from companies yet reported; if anything, we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by results from big Wall Street banks, major manufacturers, etc. We\u2019re just starting to see companies in Tech reporting for calendar Q1, but even there we are \u201cso far, so good.\u201d The Dow is +110 points at this hour, the S&P 500 is +20 and the Nasdaq +75 points. This follows a solid day in the green across the board.\r\n\r\nEconomic prints are coming in slowly this week. After today\u2019s open, we\u2019ll see S&P flash PMI results on both Services and Manufacturing for the month of April. Expectations for both are currently 52.0 \u2014 a slight uptick from the previous 51.7 in Services and 51.9 in Manufacturing a month ago. And importantly, these figures remain north of the 50 threshold, which is the tipping point between gains and losses. Elsewhere, we\u2019ll get New Home Sales for March: expected at 669K from 662K the prior month.\r\n\r\nThe big economic report for the week comes out Friday. This will be the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for March, which is expected to come in-line with the previous month, slightly up year over year, and slightly down on core year over year. When the Fed talks about not being satisfied that inflation metrics are suitably driven from our economy as of now, it\u2019s the PCE they are most clearly referencing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself name-drops PCE data during his Q&A periods following Fed meetings.\r\n\r\nAhead of today\u2019s open, General Motors GM is out with Q1 results. The \u201cBig 3\u201d automaker posted a +26% earnings beat \u2014 $2.62 per share versus $2.08 expected (and $2.21 in the year-ago quarter) \u2014 on a +4.2% top-line outperformance, to $43.01 billion (nicely ahead of the $39.99 billion a year ago). Further, the maker of Chevrolets, Cadillacs and Buicks, etc. has upgraded forward guidance, citing a mixed outlook for its EV offerings. Shares are up +4% on the release, adding to the +20% year to date. For more on GM\u2019s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nDelivery and logistics giant United Parcel Service UPS posted mixed results for its Q1 this morning. The company estimates by a solid dime on earnings to $1.43 per share, while coming up a tad short on the top line: $21.71 billion versus $21.91 billion in the Zacks consensus. It laid off 12K workers in the quarter as business has softened; competitor FedEx had posted similar results in its most recent earnings report. Even though UPS only has one earnings miss in the past five years, shares are down -1.2%, adding to the -8% year to date.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo PEP, another read on consumer appetite, posted strength on both top and bottom lines before today\u2019s opening bell. Earnings of $1.61 per share outpaced the $1.52 expected (and the $1.50 per share reported a year ago) for a +5.9% beat, while revenues of $18.25 billion narrowly improved over the Zacks consensus by +0.62%. It\u2019s the fourth straight earnings beat, and third revenue beat in the past four quarters in sales. Yet shares are down -0.3% in today\u2019s pre-market, despite its China business improving. For more on PEP\u2019s earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nSpotify SPOT surpassed estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of $1.05 per ADR (Spotify is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden) easily trounced the 63 cents expected, and is finally turning a profit after years of negative earnings. This amounts to a +66.67% positive surprise, on $3.95 billion in sales, +2.05% from the Zacks consensus and notably improved from $3.26 billion reported a year ago. The stock is ramping up another +7% in the pre-market, +45% year to date and +107% over the past year. For more on SPOT's earnings, click here.\r\n\r\nAfter today\u2019s close, Tesla TSLA comes out with Q1 earnings. Market participants are bracing for one of the worst quarters from the EV leader in recent memory, and the stock continues to carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a Value-Growth-Momentum score of F. We\u2019ll also hear from Visa V and Texas Instruments TXN on earnings after the bell sounds this afternoon.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc. posted stronger-than-expected sales growth thanks to robust demand in its international divisions, while volumes dropped in North America.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRay Dalio\u2019s Famous Trade Is Sputtering, Investors Bailing Apple\u2019s China iPhone Sales Dive 19% in Worst Quarter Since 2020 Trump Has Only $6.8 Million for Legal Fees With Trial Underway Zimbabwe\u2019s ZiG Wipes Out 330% Stocks Rally Elon Musk\u2019s Robotaxi Dreams Plunge Tesla Into Chaos\n\nThe owner of Mountain Dew sodas and Frito-Lay chips said that net revenue in the first quarter rose 2.7%, beating the average analyst estimate of 2.3%.\n\nSales in Pepsi\u2019s international business, which represented nearly 40% of total net revenue last year, were up 9%. Emerging markets such as Mexico, Brazil and China delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, as did Australia, while sales in Britain were up by the high single digits.\n\nAfter a period of the highest inflation in four decades, makers of branded consumer goods have suffered declining volumes as shoppers, especially in the US, switch to supermarket own-brands. Pepsi\u2019s North American food and drinks divisions sold fewer goods by volume compared with a year earlier. Drinks volumes were down 5% in the region.\n\nChief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said on a call with analysts that globally the consumer is very resilient, supported by low unemployment and growing wages. But there is a weak spot in the US: \u201cThe lower-income consumer in the US is stretched, is strategizing a lot to make their budgets get to the end of the month,\u201d he said, adding that PepsiCo is making an effort to keep those poorer Americans buying its products.\n\nNorth American revenue from Quaker Foods, the oats brand, fell 24% after the company expanded a recall to include more cereals, bars and snacks due to a risk of salmonella. The company said it has restarted limited production of some of the affected products.\n\nPepsiCo shares fell as much as 2.9% in New York trading Tuesday, the most since February. The stock was up 3.9% this year through Monday, trailing the 5.1% rise of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nThe company confirmed its 2024 outlook of organic sales growth of at least 4%, with North America lagging the rest of the business.\n\nCompared with a year earlier, Pepsi won savory-snack market share in China, India, Brazil, Australia and Pakistan. For drinks, it picked up share in Brazil, Turkey, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan.\n\n--With assistance from Brett Pulley.\n\n(Updates with CEO comments in fifth paragraph, shares in seventh paragraph, market share in final paragraph.)\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets A Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender China\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires Big Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner What Really Happens When You Trade In an iPhone at the Apple Store\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For the quarter ended March 2024, PepsiCo (PEP) reported revenue of $18.25 billion, up 2.3% over the same period last year. EPS came in at $1.61, compared to $1.50 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.62% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.14 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $1.52, the EPS surprise was +5.92%.\n\nWhile investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.\n\nSince these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.\n\nHere is how PepsiCo performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nNet revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region: $1.06 billion versus $989.41 million estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +5.8% change. Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America: $5.68 billion versus $5.79 billion estimated by three analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +1.7% change. Net revenue- Quaker Foods North America: $593 million compared to the $650.19 million average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of -23.7% year over year. Net revenue- Africa, Middle East and South Asia: $1.04 billion compared to the $970.20 million average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of +2.1% year over year. Net revenue- PepsiCo Beverages North America: $5.87 billion compared to the $5.83 billion average estimate based on three analysts. The reported number represents a change of +1.3% year over year. Net revenue- Europe: $1.94 billion versus the three-analyst average estimate of $1.93 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +2.7%. Net revenue- Latin America: $2.07 billion versus the three-analyst average estimate of $1.98 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +16.3%. Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region: $233 million versus $223.90 million estimated by three analysts on average. Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Frito-Lay North America: $1.58 billion versus the three-analyst average estimate of $1.64 billion. Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Latin America: $490 million compared to the $436.28 million average estimate based on three analysts.

        "content": "Renowned for their steadiness, blue-chip stocks are favored by investors seeking stability. I certainly include myself in this group. Companies with blue-chip status tend to weather market volatility well, and boast enduring growth track records. This makes these companies valuable portfolio assets for longer-term investors who don\u2019t want to try to trade around headline news.\n\nThe sort of set-it-and-forget-it model is one I\u2019ve tried to build over time. These three companies are among my top picks in this regard.\n\nNo matter what happens with inflation, monetary policy, and other macro factors, these companies should continue to perform well in any environment. Here\u2019s why I think these three blue-chip stocks are worth putting in any portfolio with a time horizon of a decade or longer right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett, the so-called Oracle of Ohama, is one of the most closely-watched investors by many stock analysts and business people alike. This is largely due to Buffett\u2019s long-term mindset and investing strategy. That\u2019s not going to change anytime soon, and his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) will continue to remain in high demand for this reason alone.\n\nOf course, with the nonagenarian getting older by the year, a succession strategy has been put in place, with the company in very solid hands. Buffett has built a world-class team around him, with other investors who share his long-term outlook that can carry the torch after his passing. Last year\u2019s unfortunate passing of his long-term business partner Charlie Munger certainly caught many by surprise, but that\u2019s the reality investors are facing with this company right now.\n\nIn 2010, Berkshire issued stock for BNSF acquisition, a rare dilution event. However, the company has continued to buy back billions of stock each year, with about $9 billion repurchased last year. More repurchases are expected, and that\u2019s core to the reason why many investors hold this stock long-term.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway stands out as a secure haven for investors during market turbulence. It remains resilient with diversified interests spanning railroads, restaurants, insurers, and retailers and a substantial $167.6 billion cash reserve. Additionally, its Class B stock surged 24% over the past year. In Q1, Buffett signaled confidence in BRK-B\u2019s value as it has been consistently repurchasing stocks.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s obvious the company has enduring value, and investors should take note of this. Compared to other so-called blue-chip stocks, Berkshire Hathaway is among the most defensive long-term conglomerates worth holding, particularly for those worried about a potential market crash on the horizon.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) New McDonalds Being Built in 2020, Close Up of Main McD Sign\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough global challenges remain, among companies in the fast food sector, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) continues to be the stalwart most investors look to for stability. MCD stock has been among the most resilient companies in the market, particularly during previous crises. And with a long-term track record like few companies on the S&P 500, there\u2019s a reason why investors continue to hold this stock in their portfolios.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s growth profile has been hit somewhat by inflation in recent years. The company\u2019s ability to keep prices low has been limited, leading many to suggest other players in the fast food space could make up market share. To a certain degree, this is true.\n\nAll of McDonald\u2019s franchisees still pay their franchise fees, rent, and royalties, and this has become a stream of passive yet strong income for the company. This is what sets McDonald\u2019s apart from its rivals. Franchisees must commit to 20-year rental agreements, making this revenue stream resilient and potentially advantageous. Typically, franchisees opt to renew contracts, highlighting the reliability of real estate income for McDonald\u2019s. Last year, McDonald\u2019s rent revenue spiked a 9% increase, evidencing consistent growth.\n\nWith a 48-year track record of dividend increases, it\u2019s no wonder MCD stock is a must-have blue chip stock for substantial gains. Moreover, analysts predict a positive outlook for the company over the next two years. I think this stock\u2019s upside could be even better than what the analysts suggest, if the company is able to really focus on its pricing and menu strategy moving forward.\n\nPepsi (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) commands a solid position in the consumer-packaged goods sector, offering its iconic cola and diverse snack lineup. Despite market challenges, PEP stock has declined only 14% from its 2023 peak. And at current levels, I think this stock presents a soliddefensive play with a dividend yield hovering around 3%.\n\nTrading at 27-times trailing earnings, its recent downgrade by Argus has raised growth concerns amidst industry pressures. However, investments in automation promise long-term margin improvements for Pepsi.\n\nThe company\u2019s North America business include distinct beverage, snacking, and food businesses, yet international markets combine these under regional categories. Notably, net revenue surged in Latin America by 68%, Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand by 39%, and Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia by 34%.\n\nEfficiencies in international markets have boosted PepsiCo\u2019s profits. Operating profit from the aforementioned regions surged from $2.2 billion in 2020 to nearly $3.8 billion in 2023. With continued efficient scaling, PepsiCo could surpass earnings expectations. Coupled with its high-yield dividend, investors are likely to continue to enjoy market-beating returns for some time to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald\u2019s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.92%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of $1.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of 3.49%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nPepsiCo , which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, posted revenues of $18.25 billion for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.62%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $17.85 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPepsiCo shares have added about 3.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for PepsiCo?\n\nWhile PepsiCo has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.22 on $22.78 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.15 on $94.64 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Beverages - Soft drinks is currently in the top 30% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Coca-Cola (KO), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2024. The results are expected to be released on April 30.\n\nThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nCoca-Cola's revenues are expected to be $10.95 billion, down 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "PepsiCo reported better-than-expected revenue in the first quarter on strong international demand for its snacks and beverages.\n\nThe Purchase, New York-based company said revenue rose 2% to $18.3 billion for the January-April period. That was higher than the $18 billion Wall Street forecast, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nIn North America revenue rose 2%. Sales were hurt by a recall early in the quarter of Quaker Oats cereal, bars and snacks because of potential contamination with salmonella. Quaker Foods sales dropped 24% during the quarter.\n\nBut the company saw 11% sales growth in Asia Pacific and 10% sales growth in Europe.\n\nSales in Europe grew despite fewer products on grocery shelves in some countries. Carrefour, one of Europe\u2019s largest supermarket chains, announced in January that it was pulling PepsiCo products from store shelves in France, Belgium, Spain and Italy due to unacceptable price increases. The two companies resolved their pricing dispute and Carrefour began restocking PepsiCo products in early April.\n\nPepsiCo has leaned heavily into price increases over the past two years to combat higher ingredient costs. The fourth quarter of 2023 was the company\u2019s eighth straight quarter of double-digit percentage price increases.\n\nBut those increases moderated in the first quarter. PepsiCo said net pricing was up 5% globally during the quarter, while volumes fell 2%.\n\nPepsiCo said its net earnings rose 5.6% to $2 billion in the first quarter. Excluding special items, the company earned $1.61 per share. That beat Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $1.52.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Posts Q1 Sales In Line With Estimates\n\nFood and beverage company PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) reported results in line with analysts' expectations in Q1 CY2024, with revenue up 2.3% year on year to $18.25 billion. It made a non-GAAP profit of $1.61 per share, improving from its profit of $1.50 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy PepsiCo? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $18.25 billion vs analyst estimates of $18.11 billion (small beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $1.61 vs analyst estimates of $1.52 (6% beat) Full year guidance maintained from previous, full year EPS (non-GAAP) guidance in line with Consensus Gross Margin (GAAP): 54.8%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$1.66 billion, down from $2.90 billion in the previous quarter Organic Revenue was up 2.7% year on year Sales Volumes were down 2% year on year Market Capitalization: $242.5 billion\n\nWith a history that goes back more than a century, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a household name in food and beverages today and best known for its flagship soda.\n\nBeverages and Alcohol\n\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\n\nSales Growth\n\nPepsiCo is one of the most widely recognized consumer staples companies in the world. Its influence over consumers gives it extremely high negotiating leverage with distributors, enabling it to pick and choose where it sells its products (a luxury many don't have).\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 8.8% over the last three years was decent despite consumers buying less of its products. We'll explore what this means in the \"Volume Growth\" section. PepsiCo Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, PepsiCo grew its revenue by 2.3% year on year, and its $18.25 billion in revenue was in line with Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.9% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI. Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\nVolume Growth\n\nRevenue growth can be broken down into changes in price and volume (the number of units sold). While both are important, volume is the lifeblood of a successful staples business as there\u2019s a ceiling to what consumers will pay for everyday goods; they can always trade down to non-branded products if the branded versions are too expensive.\n\nTo analyze whether PepsiCo generated its growth from changes in price or volume, we can compare its volume growth to its organic revenue growth, which excludes non-fundamental impacts on company financials like mergers and currency fluctuations.\n\nOver the last two years, PepsiCo's average quarterly sales volumes have shrunk by 1.9%. This decrease isn't ideal as the quantity demanded for consumer staples products is typically stable. Luckily, PepsiCo was able to offset fewer customers purchasing its products by charging higher prices, enabling it to generate 10.9% average organic revenue growth. We hope the company can grow its volumes soon, however, as consistent price increases (on top of inflation) aren't sustainable over the long term unless the business is really really special. PepsiCo Year-On-Year Volume Growth\n\nIn PepsiCo's Q1 2024, sales volumes dropped 2% year on year. This result was a further deceleration from the 2% year-on-year decline it posted 12 months ago, showing the business is struggling to push its products.\n\nKey Takeaways from PepsiCo's Q1 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly PepsiCo blew past analysts' organic revenue growth expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EPS narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its operating margin missed analysts' expectations and its gross margin missed Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, guidance was maintained from previous, and specifically, the company's full year EPS guidance was in line with guidance. Zooming out, we think this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing that the company is staying on track. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $175.11 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in PepsiCo right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Ananya Mariam Rajesh\n\n(Reuters) -PepsiCo beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday as demand for its sodas and snacks like Cheetos and Doritos in international markets drove growth even as it witnessed a slowdown in the United States.\n\nConsumers across Europe, Asia Pacific and China shelled out money for PepsiCo's pricey sodas and chips, while customers in the U.S. cut back on the products due to strained budgets.\n\n\"We've had three years of ... massive consumer inflation and that has to be absorbed and I think the cumulative impact of that put a bit of strain on the consumer. But we expect that to abate as time goes on,\" PepsiCo CFO Jamie Caulfield said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPepsiCo's average prices jumped 5% in the first quarter. Its organic volume slipped 2%, compared to a 4% drop seen in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe company's international business accounted for about 40% of its total fiscal 2023 revenue, while its North America businesses accounted for the remaining.\n\nThe company also maintained its fiscal 2024 forecasts of organic sales growth of 4% and core profit of $8.15 per share.\n\nFirst-quarter sales at PepsiCo's largest business, its North America beverage unit, rose 1%, while organic volume fell 5%.\n\nTotal sales at its Quaker Foods North America unit fell 24% following Quaker product recalls first made in December in the U.S. due to a potential salmonella contamination.\n\nPepsiCo executives said they expect the company's North America businesses to gradually improve as impacts associated with product recalls moderate.\n\nThe company's first-quarter net revenue rose 2.3% to $18.25 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $18.07 billion. PepsiCo's core profit of $1.61 per share topped expectations of $1.52.\n\n\"This is going to be another year of price-led revenue growth even though pricing has come down,\" Wedbush analyst Gerald Pascarelli said.\n\nPepsiCo's shares were down marginally at $176.21 in premarket trading.\n\n(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "content": "(Adds details on results and forecast in paragraphs 6,8-9)\n\nApril 23 (Reuters) - PepsiCo beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter revenue on Tuesday as demand held steady for the soda and snacks giant's Tropicana juices and Cheetos in its international markets.\n\nConsumers have remained resilient and shelled out money for PepsiCo's Lays chips and 7UP products across the company's international markets, helping offset a slowdown witnessed in its major market United States.\n\nSeveral rounds of price hikes in the U.S. have led consumers in the region to push back on the company's sodas and juices as sticky inflation makes customers cautious with their spending.\n\nThe company's international business accounted for about 40% of its total fiscal 2023 revenue.\n\nPepsiCo's average prices jumped 5% for the quarter ended March 23, while organic volume slipped 2%. That compared with an average price increase of 9% in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSales at the company's North America beverage unit, PepsiCo's largest business, rose 1% in the first quarter, while organic volumes fell 5%.\n\nThe company's net revenue rose to $18.25 billion in the quarter from $17.85 billion a year earlier, while analysts had estimated $18.07 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nPepsiCo maintained its annual organic sales and core profit forecasts.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.61 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.52 per share. (Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and PepsiCo Inc. PEP may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.\n\nThat is because PepsiCois seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PEP in this report.\n\nIn fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PEP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.50% heading into earnings season.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price and Consensus PepsiCo, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nWhy is this Important?\n\nA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).\n\nGiven that PEP has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nClearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for PepsiCo and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Are These 4 Beverage Stocks Poised to Hit Q1 Earnings Targets?",
        "content": "The first-quarter reports of companies in the Beverage industry, mainly comprising the alcohol and soft drink variants, are likely to reflect their abilities to navigate through the changing consumer preferences, global economic shifts and supply-chain challenges. Notably, the beverage industry participants have made strides to keep up with the changing consumer choices by optimizing their portfolios, focusing on core brands, investments in innovation and expansion into adjacent categories.\r\n\r\nConsumers have been becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Within the soft drink space, the plant-based and functional beverage categories have gained significant traction, as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Then again, alcohol companies have been witnessing increased demand for premium and high-end products, as well as a shift toward craft spirits with low or no alcohol content.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we believe that the earnings reports of beverage companies will reflect the success of their investments in bringing relevant and innovative products to market.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, beverage companies are expected to have reaped the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding direct-to-consumer channels, loyalty programs and personalized marketing strategies to stay competitive in the digital landscape. We expect the gains from investments in e-commerce and online platforms to get reflected in the top lines of the beverage companies in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, players in the beverage space have been witnessing continued cost pressures from the inflationary environment, particularly higher transportation expenses and elevated commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs. Fluctuating prices of raw materials, such as grains and fruits, have been key deterrents. Additionally, the companies have been seeing increased packaging costs due to the rise in steel and aluminum costs. Also, higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&A costs, have been pulling down the margins of beverage companies. Nonetheless, beverage players\u2019 focus on cost-saving and efficient pricing actions are expected to have helped cushion margin pressures in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nIn all, we have mixed views about the earnings outcomes of companies in the beverage industry, which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Staples sector. Notably, the sector is currently ranked among the bottom 25% of the 16 Zacks sectors.\r\n\r\nPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trends, the Consumer Staples sector\u2019s first-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to decline 2.2% year over year, with revenues advancing 2.6%.\r\n\r\nThat said, let us take a look at four Beverage stocks, which are scheduled to report results this week. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo Inc. PEP has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified beverage and convenient food portfolios, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. PEP\u2019s first-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives.\r\n\r\nHowever, PepsiCo\u2019s first-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.50% at present. (Read More: Here's Why PepsiCo Looks Poised for Earnings Beat in Q1)\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nThe Boston Beer Company Inc. SAM has been witnessing positive trends, driven by the progress of its Beyond Beer strategy, the premiumization of the beer industry and robust trends for its twisted tea brand. The company\u2019s continued focus on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand development is likely to have boosted its operational performance and position in the market.\r\n\r\nOn the operational front, Boston Beer has been benefiting from strong price realization and procurement savings, which more than offset increased inflationary costs. This has been a boon to the gross margin. Additionally, a decline in advertising, promotional and selling expenses on lower freight to distributors due to reduced rates and volumes is likely to have boosted the bottom line in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nHowever, declines in shipments and depletions, as well as continued challenges in the hard seltzer category, have been weighing on the company\u2019s top-line performance. Boston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends have been partly hurting the company\u2019s depletions. Soft performances of Truly Hard Seltzer, Angry Orchard, Samuel Adams and Hard Mountain Dew have been hurting shipments.\r\n\r\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boston Beer this time around. The company has a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +66.45%. (Read More: Can Boston Beer Beat on Q1 Earnings Despite Cost Woes?)\n\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Quote\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper Inc. KDP focuses on continued brand strength, significant pricing actions, solid performance in its cold beverages and strong market share gains are likely to have aided its first-quarter performance. In recent quarters, most of Keurig\u2019s sales growth across categories and improvement in organic sales have been pricing-driven. The company has also been confident about delivering sustained organic growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nKDP has been gaining traction in the Refreshment Beverage segment for quite some time now. Higher net price realization and a rise in volume/mix have been the key contributors to the segment\u2019s growth. However, pressures related to input cost inflation, rising transportation costs and supply-chain disruptions are likely to have dented the quarterly performance. This, along with the adverse impacts of higher marketing investment, is expected to have marred the performance. The company has also been witnessing sluggishness in its Coffee segment for a while now.\r\n\r\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keurig this time around. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.30%.

The company\u2019s efforts to expand in the U.S. specialized distribution segment bode well. FMX's digital initiatives, business expansion endeavors and continued strength in OXXO Mexico and OXXO Gas are also expected to have boosted its top line in first-quarter 2024. Moreover, it has been displaying solid financial flexibility.\r\n\r\nHowever, FEMSA has been witnessing weak operating margins for a while now, driven by margin contractions at the Coca-Cola FEMSA, Proximity Americas and Health divisions. The continuation of these trends is likely to have hurt FEMSA\u2019s operating margins in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nFomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best dividend leaders to buy according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Analysts.\n\nIncome generation has always been a primary goal for investors when making investment decisions. Therefore, it is no surprise that investors often favor dividend stocks, which are mainly known for providing steady streams of income. They particularly gravitate toward quality dividend stocks that not only offer consistent payouts but also demonstrate a history of increasing dividends over time and maintaining stable yields. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividend income has accounted for 34% of the market\u2019s overall return on average from 1940 to 2023.\n\nIn addition to their significant contribution to the market\u2019s overall returns, investing in dividend stocks offers investors a means to reduce risks associated with fluctuating market conditions. DWS Group reported that in the last 20 years, the monthly volatility of dividend returns stands at 0.10% as compared to 3.75% observed for price returns. The report also mentioned that despite market fluctuations, the overall return during this period has remained positive for investors. While the riskier elements contributed significantly to this return, it is the dividend stream that emerged as a reliable, comparatively safer option amid the stock market\u2019s uncertainties.\n\nDividend stocks fell behind the curve in 2023 thanks to the boom in tech stocks. However, this did not shatter investors\u2019 confidence as they held on steadily to their dividend investments. One of the main reasons for this advocacy was that dividends paid by the S&P 500 companies have increased consistently over the years, as we reported in one of our articles. Moreover, analysts have given a positive stance on dividend payments for 2024 as well. Janus Henderson\u2019s head of global equity income, Ben Lofthouse, mentioned in a report that pessimism regarding the global economy in 2023 had been proven baseless. He added that despite the certain outlook for the economy, dividends appeared to be well supported. Lofthouse further said that the resilience of the global economy would probably result in another year of dividend growth in 2024, projecting global payouts to increase to $1.72 trillion.\n\nWhile dividend stocks did not have a rosy 2023, many sectors captivated investors\u2019 interest by announcing increases in their dividends. According to a report by Janus Henderson, eight out of ten sectors of the economy experienced growth in their dividend payouts in 2023. Among these industries, consumer discretionary companies led the pack with a notable year-over-year increase of 26.1%. In addition to this, banks, which are known for their dividend payments, played a crucial role in driving half of the overall dividend payout growth, marking a significant rebound from 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend leaders in the market as these companies have been offering growing dividends for decades now. Moreover, their strong balance sheets and solid cash generation indicate the likelihood of potential dividend growth in the coming years. In this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend leaders according to analysts. 10 Best Dividend Leaders to Buy According to Analysts\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned holdings of First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (FDL), which tracks the performance of the 100 highest-yielding stocks with consistent growth in dividends and can maintain their dividends in the future. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets, as of April 4. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 funds as of Q4 2023. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nNote: Financial stocks are popular among analysts because of their reasonable valuations, strong asset quality, and consistent loan growth. So, most of the stocks in our list belong to the financial sector.\n\n10. First Horizon Corporation (NYSE:FHN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 50\n\nUpside Potential as of April 4: 10.62%\n\nFirst Horizon Corporation (NYSE:FHN) is a Tennessee-based bank holding and financial services company that offers various related services to its consumers. Currently, the company's quarterly dividend stands at $0.15 per share for a dividend yield of 4.07%, as of April 4. It is one of the best dividend leaders to buy according to analysts.\n\nAs per Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2023, 50 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database held stakes in First Horizon Corporation (NYSE:FHN), up from 48 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $1.36 billion.\n\n9. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 36\n\nUpside Potential as of April 4: 11.4%\n\nU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a diversified bank holding company that offers a wide range of banking, mortgage, investment, and related services. On March 12, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $0.49 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. Overall, it maintains a 13-year streak of consistent dividend growth, which makes USB one of the dividend leaders on our list. As of April 4, the stock offers a dividend yield of 4.57%.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was a part of 36 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q4 2023, growing from 29 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a total value of over $1.08 billion. With nearly 10 million shares, Viking Global was the company's largest stakeholder in Q4.\n\nArtisan Partners mentioned U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n\u201cBanks were well represented among our top Q4 performers as the Treasury market rally drove big gains in the bank stocks. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America\u2014the three banks we hold in the portfolio\u2014were each among our top five contributors to return. When bank stocks sold off in Q1 due to fears of contagion following Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s failure, we took advantage of the market dislocation by purchasing top-10 US banks USB and PNC at what were, in our view, cheap prices. USB and PNC are banks we have known for years. They are well managed and well capitalized. As large banks, they were less impacted by the turmoil that affected smaller institutions as depositors sought the safest places to store their money. The recent rebound is an example of how our approach of investing in out-of-favor businesses can lead to alpha. USB and PNC are not immune from industry-wide headwinds from higher deposit costs, pressured net interest margins and fleeing deposits. However, we did not see these banks having a similar level of risk, with respect to uninsured deposits and unrealized losses, which contributed in varying degrees to the collapses of other banks in March 2023. As investors, we cannot avoid risk. However, we are willing to take risk if we are being compensated appropriately.\u201d\n\n8. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 39\n\nUpside Potential as of April 4: 12.46%\n\nComerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is a Texas-based financial services company that offers a wide range of financial products and related services to its consumers.

Though the company does not hold any dividend growth track record, it has an over 30-year run of paying regular dividends to shareholders. The stock's dividend yield on April 4 came in at 5.38%.\n\nAs of the end of the December quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), compared with 42 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $755 million.\n\n7. M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\n\nUpside Potential as of April 4: 13.13%\n\nM&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) is an American bank holding company, headquartered in New York.

The company's current quarterly dividend comes in at $1.30 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.77%, as recorded on April 4.

        "title": "Will IBM Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2030?",
        "content": "Technology powerhouse International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) used to be an industry giant. Big Blue's market cap peaked at $239 billion in the summer of 1999, sparking speculation about perhaps forming the world's first trillion-dollar company.\n\nBut the dot-com bubble popped, and IBM changed gears. The market cap reached $230 billion again in 2012, ending an era where other tech giants were copying IBM's one-stop IT shop business model.\n\nBut that year also marked a sharp strategy shift under newly appointed CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM stiff-armed the hardware side of its operations, apart from the unique mainframe systems segment. When Rometty handed off the reins to current CEO Arvind Krishna in the spring of 2020, IBM was refocused on hybrid cloud computing, data security, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAnd its market cap had dropped to just $106 billion.\n\nThe company has enjoyed another renaissance since then, joining the AI boom just a bit later than many peers. Currently perched at a total market value of $167 billion, is the reformed Big Blue finally destined for trillion-dollar greatness before the end of this decade?\n\nLet's set some realistic targets for IBM\n\nA starting point of $167 billion is pretty impressive. Only 45 of the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's household names can boast a larger market cap than IBM's today.\n\nOne-trillion is still a long way away, though. I'm talking about a sixfold jump, and share prices would rise even faster thanks to IBM's unstoppable habit of buying back shares by the boatload.\n\nSo if IBM has a chance of reaching $1 trillion at all, it won't be a quick and easy romp.\n\nThat's a sixfold gain in five years and change. Most stocks wouldn't even dream of it. And honestly, IBM faces some long odds here. Super Micro Computers(NASDAQ: SMCI) and Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) have posted the strongest gains on the stock market over the last five years.\n\nSupermicro soared on the wings of unique AI systems; Celsius was a literal penny stock five years ago, and its health-conscious energy drink had no distribution system or marketing to speak of. It's a lot easier to multiply those modest starting values than it is to list IBM from a $167 billion platform.\n\nAnd even then, Celsius barely reached the sixfold market cap multiplication target. Supermicro only made it halfway. CELH Market Cap Chart\n\nWhy I don't mind IBM missing the trillion-dollar mark\n\nSo the trillion-dollar goal looks nearly unreachable from IBM's current starting point, given only five or six years of AI-driven growth. That's alright. I still think IBM is one of the best AI buys in today's market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company can pull its weight with much milder price gains. It doesn't have to meet some arbitrary market-cap goal in five years. Remember, only one stock actually achieved a similar gain over the last five-year period, and that was from an optimal starting point. IBM isn't reinventing energy drinks here or on the verge of signing a global distribution deal with PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). That's what it took to lift Celsius Holdings' stock sixfold in half a decade.\n\nBut the company is nibbling on explosive growth opportunities in the massive market for business-grade AI services. Its Watson AI engine and the related Watsonx generative AI platform were built for enterprise customers, and the long-term contracts are starting to drop in.\n\nMeanwhile, Big Blue's stock trades at just 22 times earnings and 12 times free cash flows. That's a bargain-basement deal next to AI-driven market darlings like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Supermicro. IBM's stock could triple and still look affordable next to these recent Wall Street rockets.\n\nSo yes, IBM offers a tempting blend of low share prices and exciting growth opportunity in the AI market. You should look away from that hard-to-reach trillion-dollar goal and embrace IBM for what it is -- an undervalued tech titan. You should pick up a few low-priced IBM shares while you can before the market really catches on to the company's valuable position in the enterprise AI industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and International Business Machines wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Tesla Semi trucks in short supply for PepsiCo as its rivals use competing EV big rigs",
        "content": "By Jessica DiNapoli\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Key Tesla customer PepsiCo made initial payments for 100 Tesla Semis in 2017, intending to use the electric-truck fleet to haul its Cheetos, Lays potato chips and Pepsi soda pop to retailers.\n\nBut according to the food-and-drinks maker and one of its executives with knowledge of the deal, PepsiCo was using only 36 of Teslas promised 100 electric trucks as of this month.\n\nThe shortfall, which hasn't been previously disclosed, lays bare the challenges for Tesla as it seeks to become a high-volume player in the truck-manufacturing business. Other would-be Tesla customers including food distributor Sysco, UPS and Walmart Canada continue to wait for Tesla Semi trucks and are turning to rival electric-truck makers.\n\nThe struggles of shipping enough Semis come at a bad time for Tesla, which has seen growth for its consumer electric vehicles slow, forcing it to cut prices and hurt margins. In addition, Reuters reported this month that Tesla had decided to cancel its long-promised inexpensive car that investors had hoped would drive further growth.\n\nDiesel-powered 18-wheelers are a major source of pollution. As companies pledge to slash their greenhouse gas emissions, the proposition for Tesla is clear.\n\n\"People might wonder why build a semi truck?\" Musk said at the carmaker's gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, in late 2022, when Tesla delivered the Semis to PepsiCo. \"It's 20% of U.S. vehicle emissions.\"\n\nUnder the Biden administration, companies using electric trucks qualify for large subsidies to offset their purchases. PepsiCo secured over $20 million in government grants to cover the cost of 32 of the Semis, plus federal subsidies of $40,000 per vehicle.\n\nTesla, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday, did not return a request for comment.\n\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said in a statement that the company's plans for the Semis can shift when technology and the need to establish infrastructure is involved.\n\nThe soda and snack producer was the first of Corporate America to take delivery of any of Tesla's highly-anticipated Semi trucks. \"The 100 (Tesla Semis) we have a deposit on, we\u2019ll get those out in \u201823 for sure,\" Mike O\u2019Connell, PepsiCo\u2019s vice president of supply chain, told Reuters at the time.\n\nBut, as of this month, PepsiCo was \"focused on best leveraging the 36 (Tesla Semi) vehicles that are currently in our fleet,\" a spokesperson told Reuters in early April. That\u2019s the same number PepsiCo first started with when it began using the trucks to transport goods from its Modesto food manufacturing plant and Sacramento bottling site, PepsiCo executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has been looking to build a truck-making business for years.\n\nTesla had said it would have the Semi in production by 2019. In October 2022, Musk told investors that his goal was to make 50,000 Semis in 2024. Tesla finally unveiled the Tesla Semi truck in late 2022.\n\nBut in June 2023, Musk said at an energy conference that \"there just weren't enough batteries\" for Tesla to reach \"volume production\" of the truck, without quantifying how many Semis that would be. He said Tesla would reach volume production in 2024 \"as the battery problem gets solved.\"\n\nSvein Sollie, the transportation director at ASKO Norway, the logistical arm of Norway's largest food retailer NorgesGruppen, used his personal credit card to put down an initial deposit on 10 of the Tesla Semis in 2017 but has not received any.\n\n\"We are not happy with the situation at Tesla,\" Sollie said. \"(It's) almost seven years now, it's a long time to wait.\u201d\n\nUPS reserved 125 Tesla Semi tucks in 2017, one of Tesla's biggest orders at the time. A spokesperson for the package delivery company told Reuters on April 16 that it is \"working closely with Tesla to determine a date for us to take delivery of the trucks,\" but declined to provide additional details.\n\nMeanwhile, UPS, Walmart Canada, Sysco and Schneider National, a transportation company that works for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay, said they are turning to Daimler Truck, maker of the Freightliner eCascadia. All four companies said they had begun to put dozens of eCascadia electric big rigs on the road.\n\nThe eCascadia's range is around 230 miles, while the Tesla Semi can go about 500 miles. Schneider said it uses nearly 100 eCascadia trucks to haul goods including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay products.\n\nDaimler Truck North America said the eCascadia is used in more than 55 separate companies' fleets.\n\nTo be sure, Tesla has its own fleet of close to 100 Semi trucks that are traveling between its factories in Fremont, California and Sparks, Tesla executive Lars Moravy said on reality show Jay Leno's Garage in December.\n\nIn addition, logistics provider Martin Brower has said on its website that it used two Tesla Semis to make deliveries to its restaurant customers earlier this year, as part of a pilot. It did not respond to additional requests for comment.\n\nIn Tesla's quarterly earnings call on Jan. 24 Andrew Baglino, an executive who has since left the company, said Tesla recently began expanding its plant in Nevada to manufacture the Semi. Musk said in March that it would \"make sense to also build the Semi in Europe\" at the company's factory outside of Berlin, according to local news reports.\n\nPepsi Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew said in a recent interview with Reuters that PepsiCo was working on building out the infrastructure to support an electric fleet, including employees who can service the vehicles and power grids strong enough to charge them.\n\n\"You're talking about a system,\" Andrew said. \"All of those things have to happen before we can electrify the fleet.\"\n\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said the company would be deploying more electric vehicles from a range of manufactures as they are available.\n\nPepsiCo investor Green Century Capital Management has reservations about the company's time table for rolling out the Semis.\n\n\"The fact they're running behind schedule is concerning,\" said Andrea Ranger, a shareholder advocate at Green Century. The investment firm has followed PepsiCo's use of electric vehicles and is pushing the company to consider its impacts on biodiversity at its annual meeting in May.\n\nIn Europe, ASKO Norway is using electric semis from Scania and Volvo while it waits for Tesla, according to Sollie. He said Tesla told him that Tesla is prioritizing Semi deliveries to Pepsi and other U.S. customers.\n\n(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York; additional reporting by Nick Carey in London and Hyun Joo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n\nView comments",

PepsiCo secured over $20 million in government grants to cover the cost of 32 of the Semis, plus federal subsidies of $40,000 per vehicle.\n\nTesla, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday, did not return a request for comment.\n\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said in a statement that the company's plans for the Semis can shift when technology and the need to establish infrastructure is involved.\n\nThe soda and snack producer was the first of Corporate America to take delivery of any of Tesla's highly-anticipated Semi trucks. \"The 100 (Tesla Semis) we have a deposit on, we\u2019ll get those out in \u201823 for sure,\" Mike O\u2019Connell, PepsiCo\u2019s vice president of supply chain, told Reuters at the time.\n\nBut, as of this month, PepsiCo was \"focused on best leveraging the 36 (Tesla Semi) vehicles that are currently in our fleet,\" a spokesperson told Reuters in early April. That\u2019s the same number PepsiCo first started with when it began using the trucks to transport goods from its Modesto food manufacturing plant and Sacramento bottling site, PepsiCo executives said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla has been looking to build a truck-making business for years.\n\nTesla had said it would have the Semi in production by 2019. In October 2022, Musk told investors that his goal was to make 50,000 Semis in 2024. Tesla finally unveiled the Tesla Semi truck in late 2022.\n\nBut in June 2023, Musk said at an energy conference that \"there just weren't enough batteries\" for Tesla to reach \"volume production\" of the truck, without quantifying how many Semis that would be. He said Tesla would reach volume production in 2024 \"as the battery problem gets solved.\"\n\nSvein Sollie, the transportation director at ASKO Norway, the logistical arm of Norway's largest food retailer NorgesGruppen, used his personal credit card to put down an initial deposit on 10 of the Tesla Semis in 2017 but has not received any.\n\n\"We are not happy with the situation at Tesla,\" Sollie said. \"(It's) almost seven years now, it's a long time to wait.\u201d\n\nUPS reserved 125 Tesla Semi tucks in 2017, one of Tesla's biggest orders at the time. A spokesperson for the package delivery company told Reuters on April 16 that it is \"working closely with Tesla to determine a date for us to take delivery of the trucks,\" but declined to provide additional details.\n\nMeanwhile, UPS, Walmart Canada, Sysco and Schneider National , a transportation company that works for PepsiCo's Frito-Lay, said they are turning to Daimler Truck, maker of the Freightliner eCascadia. All four companies said they had begun to put dozens of eCascadia electric big rigs on the road.\n\nThe eCascadia's range is around 230 miles, while the Tesla Semi can go about 500 miles. Schneider said it uses nearly 100 eCascadia trucks to haul goods including PepsiCo's Frito-Lay products.\n\nDaimler Truck North America said the eCascadia is used in more than 55 separate companies' fleets.\n\nTo be sure, Tesla has its own fleet of close to 100 Semi trucks that are traveling between its factories in Fremont, California and Sparks, Tesla executive Lars Moravy said on reality show Jay Leno's Garage in December.\n\nIn addition, logistics provider Martin Brower has said on its website that it used two Tesla Semis to make deliveries to its restaurant customers earlier this year, as part of a pilot. It did not respond to additional requests for comment.\n\nIn Tesla's quarterly earnings call on Jan. 24 Andrew Baglino, an executive who has since left the company, said Tesla recently began expanding its plant in Nevada to manufacture the Semi. Musk said in March that it would \"make sense to also build the Semi in Europe\" at the company's factory outside of Berlin, according to local news reports.\n\nPepsi Chief Sustainability Officer Jim Andrew said in a recent interview with Reuters that PepsiCo was working on building out the infrastructure to support an electric fleet, including employees who can service the vehicles and power grids strong enough to charge them.\n\n\"You're talking about a system,\" Andrew said. \"All of those things have to happen before we can electrify the fleet.\"\n\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said the company would be deploying more electric vehicles from a range of manufactures as they are available.\n\nPepsiCo investor Green Century Capital Management has reservations about the company's time table for rolling out the Semis.\n\n\"The fact they're running behind schedule is concerning,\" said Andrea Ranger, a shareholder advocate at Green Century. The investment firm has followed PepsiCo's use of electric vehicles and is pushing the company to consider its impacts on biodiversity at its annual meeting in May.\n\nIn Europe, ASKO Norway is using electric semis from Scania and Volvo while it waits for Tesla, according to Sollie. He said Tesla told him that Tesla is prioritizing Semi deliveries to Pepsi and other U.S. customers.

        "content": "Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are the first names that most investors think of when it comes to non-alcoholic beverage stocks.\n\nThe competition between Coke and Pepsi is intense and cutthroat. Pepsi recently announced that it had wrestled the Subway account away from Coca-Cola.\n\n\u201cFor nearly twenty years, The Coca-Cola Company has proudly served Subway restaurants in the U.S,\u201d Coca-Cola told Fortune in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to serving Subway through the end of this year and will remain focused on delivering value for Subway, their Franchisee Partners, and consumers.\u201d\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn addition to getting the beverage account from Subway, it already supplies it with Frit0-Lay chips.\n\nYou can invest in KO and PEP stock. However, that comes with the usual shots across each other\u2019s bow in pursuit of market share.\n\nOr, you can invest in a beverage stock and gain new ground in an intensely competitive industry.\n\nHere are three of my favorites other than Coke and Pepsi.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is the largest of the three, with a market capitalization of over $18 billion. It\u2019s also a backdoor way to gain exposure to Pepsi, which owns 8.5% of the energy drink maker. It invested in Celsius as part of its August 2022 U.S. distribution deal.\n\nAt the end of March, Celsius announced expanding its distribution into Australia and New Zealand. On April 4, it announced it was expanding into France through Suntory Beverage & Food France. This follows on its January announcement of its distribution agreement with Suntory for the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nCELH has lost ground in recent weeks due to a change to its Pepsi distribution deal that gives the drinks giant more financial incentives to focus on Celsius products that could affect future margins as a result. However, it\u2019s also possible that the increased focus will add revenue growth, more than offsetting any margin reduction.\n\nI first recommended CELH stock in October 2021. It\u2019s up 166% in the 30 months since.\n\nBellRing Brands (BRBR) A photo of the brands Bell ring (BRBR) logo on a Building\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nBellRing Brands (NYSE:BRBR) is the second-largest of the three, with a market cap of over $7 billion. I recommended its shares in September 2021 as part of a \u201cBrands\u201d portfolio.\n\nBellRing\u2019s major brands include Premier Protein drinks and Dymatize. It was first spun off in October 2019 by Post Holdings (NYSE:POST), with the former parent company selling $500 million in BellRing stock. On March 10, 2022, it distributed the remaining 80.1% of BellRing stock it owned to its shareholders. Post shareholders received 1.267788 BellRing shares for each held in the parent.\n\nStory continues\n\nBellRing\u2019s Q1 2024 results in February included an 18.7% increase in sales and a 27.6% increase in net earnings. During this quarter, Premier Protein and Dymatize had an 18.9% and 20.9% revenue increase, respectively. It got out of the North American PowerBar business over the past year.\n\nIn 2024, it expects revenues of at least $1.87 billion, up from its previous guidance of $1.83 billion, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $375 million, $15 million higher than its previous guidance.\n\n13 of 17 analysts rate its stock a buy.\n\nFevertree Drinks (FQVTF) A close-up shot of glass Fevertree Drinks (FQVTY) bottles including soda water, ginger beer, tonic water, and cola.\n\nSource: IZWAN IS / Shutterstock.com\n\nFevertree Drinks (OTCMKTS:FQVTF) is the smallest of the three, with a market cap of $1.6 billion.\n\nI\u2019ve always liked the business because it makes premium carbonated cocktail mixes such as ginger beer and tonic water. However, its stock has not done well in the past five years, down 65% compared to a 75% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nIt is the value play of the three.\n\nIn January, it cut its 2024 revenue outlook from 10% sales growth to 8%. In fiscal 2023, the company forecast annual sales as high as 390 million British pounds ($485.63 million), but ultimately came in at 364 million British pounds ($463 million).\n\nInflation is partially to blame for its retreating shares. Consumers are opting for cheaper cocktail mixes or abstaining altogether to save money.\n\nOn the bright side, it expects its gross margin to improve by 600 basis points in 2024 to 38.1%, 360 basis points higher than fiscal 2022.\n\nIt has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.55, considerably less than its five-year average of 6.10.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc (KDP) Reports Next Week: What You Should Expect",
        "content": "Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc (KDP) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $3.43 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Keurig Dr Pepper?\n\nFor Keurig Dr Pepper, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.30%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Keurig Dr Pepper will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Keurig Dr Pepper would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.55, delivering a surprise of +1.85%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nPepsiCo (PEP), another stock in the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.52 for the quarter ended March 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $18.16 billion, up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for PepsiCo has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.50%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that PepsiCo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Q1 Earnings on the Horizon: Analysts' Insights on Key Performance Measures",
        "content": "In its upcoming report, PepsiCo (PEP) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share, reflecting an increase of 1.3% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $18.16 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 1.7%.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged. This demonstrates the covering analysts' collective reassessment of their initial projections during this period.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings release, it is of utmost importance to factor in any revisions made to the earnings projections. These revisions serve as a critical gauge for predicting potential investor behaviors with respect to the stock. Empirical studies consistently reveal a strong link between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nThat said, let's delve into the average estimates of some PepsiCo metrics that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' to reach $989.41 million. The estimate points to a change of -1.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America' will reach $5.79 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +3.7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net revenue- Quaker Foods North America' should arrive at $657.96 million. The estimate points to a change of -15.3% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Net revenue- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' to come in at $970.20 million. The estimate suggests a change of -4.8% year over year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net revenue- PepsiCo Beverages North America' will reach $5.83 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +0.5% year over year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Net revenue- Europe' will reach $1.93 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Net revenue- Latin America' stands at $1.98 billion. The estimate points to a change of +11.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Frito-Lay North America' will likely reach $1.64 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $1.61 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Latin America' should come in at $436.28 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $369 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' reaching $160.96 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $160 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Europe' at $156.12 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $160 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Quaker Foods North America' of $100.94 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $188 million in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for PepsiCo here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of PepsiCo have returned -1.4% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change.

        "title": "Here's Why PepsiCo (PEP) Looks Poised for Earnings Beat in Q1",
        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports first-quarter 2024 numbers on Apr 23, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $18.2 billion, implying 1.7% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\r\n\r\nFor quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.52, suggesting 1.3% growth from the $1.50 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings beat of 3.5%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nPepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nPEP\u2019s first-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is anticipated to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.\r\n\r\nWe expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 3.7% for the first quarter, driven by an 8.1% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 4.4% decline in volume.\r\n\r\nMarket share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay\u2019s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.\r\n\r\nHowever, PepsiCo\u2019s first-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.\r\n\r\nIncreased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the adjusted gross margin to be flat year over year to 55.3% in the first quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&A expenses of $7.3 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 2.7%. Driven by the flat gross margin and higher SG&A expenses, our model suggests a 30-bps operating margin decline to 15.4% in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.50%.\n\nOther Stocks to Consider\n\nHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:\r\n\r\nColgate-Palmolive CL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CL\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $5 billion, which suggests growth of 3.7% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s quarterly earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days at 82 cents per share. The estimate suggests 12.3% growth from the year-ago reported quarter. CL has delivered an earnings surprise of 4.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nVital Farms VITL currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.75% and a Zacks Rank #2. VITL is anticipated to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter 2024 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms\u2019 quarterly revenues is pegged at $137 million, indicating growth of 15% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms\u2019 earnings has moved down by a penny in the past seven days to 22 cents per share. The consensus estimate suggests 37.5% growth from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.

        "content": "GiL, an aspiring artist from Puerto Rico, named winner of the \"Rockstar Energy Presents: Mic Check con Myke Towers\" contest; will perform at a Towers concert in 2024\n\nPURCHASE, N.Y., April 17, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Rockstar Energy Drink and Myke Towers, a globally renowned Puerto Rican rapper and songwriter, today announced GiL as the official winner of \"Rockstar Energy Presents: Mic Check con Myke Towers,\" a national campaign launched in December of 2023 to discover the next generation of aspiring Latin urban music stars. Myke Towers surprises GiL with a personal visit to celebrate her win of the \u201cRockstar Energy Presents: Mic Check con Myke Towers\u201d contest.\n\nThe national music contest, which drew nearly a thousand submissions from talented individuals across the United States and Puerto Rico, evaluated contestants on three key criteria: talent, originality, and showmanship. A panel of respected industry experts carefully reviewed each submission, narrowing the pool to the top three finalists for Myke Towers to personally review. From the top three finalists, Towers hand selected GiL as the next big act in Latin urban music for her vibrant energy and cool sound that blends Trap, R&B and Urbano genres.

Her dedication and talent eventually earned GiL a scholarship from the Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation, allowing her to pursue further studies in music at the esteemed Berklee College of Music in Boston. When GiL heard about the contest, she felt like it was destiny calling, and submitted her original song without hesitation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I remember watching Myke perform at the Motherland Festival in Puerto Rico and thinking that I wanted to be like him,\" recalls GiL. \"To be here now and get the chance to perform on the same stage as Myke is such a full circle moment and a dream come true.

MNST, Keurig Dr Pepper KDP and Vita Coco Co. COCO.\n\nIndustry: Soft Drinks\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2255804/5-soft-drink-stocks-set-to-sway-in-a-prospering-industry\n\nThe Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry participants are well-placed for market share growth over the long term through innovation, adaptability and a focus on consumer well-being. Accelerating digital investments toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels bode well. Health-consciousness, sustainability and innovation are key trends driving the industry.\n\nThe industry participants are expected to gain from the expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (\u201cRTD\u201d) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Monster Beverage Corp., Keurig Dr Pepper and Vita Coco Co. are poised for growth on these actions.\n\nHowever, players in the industry have been witnessing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. Industry players\u2019 actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, look promising to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio.\n\nThe companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?\n\nInnovation & Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is witnessing increased assortments of flavors and formats, driven by a desire for unique and exotic taste experiences. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolios, and focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe players have been committed to product launches and innovation. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping.\n\nCompanies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. These investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.\n\nEvolving Trends: One of the notable trends in the U.S. beverage soft drinks industry is the increasing demand for healthier options. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages have gained significant traction as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Plant-based ingredients, such as botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are becoming popular choices for those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices.\n\nAdditionally, functional beverages that offer specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters and mood enhancers, are carving out a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.\n\nRaw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has been troubled by higher costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods.\n\nThe industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies, and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have led to higher sales and operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly increased sales in recent quarters.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects PepsiCo (PEP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis food and beverage company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.3%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $18.16 billion, up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PepsiCo?\n\nFor PepsiCo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.50%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that PepsiCo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that PepsiCo would post earnings of $1.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.78, delivering a surprise of +3.49%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nPepsiCo appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Soft Drink Stocks Set to Sway in a Prospering Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry participants are well-placed for market share growth over the long term through innovation, adaptability and a focus on consumer well-being. Accelerating digital investments toward e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels bode well. Health-consciousness, sustainability and innovation are key trends driving the industry. The industry participants are expected to gain from the expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (\u201cRTD\u201d) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST, Keurig Dr Pepper KDP and Vita Coco Company COCO are poised for growth on these actions.\r\n\r\nHowever, players in the industry have been witnessing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. Industry players\u2019 actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, look promising to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.\n\nWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?\n\nInnovation & Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is witnessing increased assortments of flavors and formats, driven by a desire for unique and exotic taste experiences. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolios, and focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players have been committed to product launches and innovation. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. These investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.\r\n\r\nEvolving Trends: One of the notable trends in the U.S. beverage soft drinks industry is the increasing demand for healthier options. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages have gained significant traction as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Plant-based ingredients, such as botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are becoming popular choices for those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that offer specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters and mood enhancers, are carving out a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.\r\n\r\nRaw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has been troubled by higher costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies, and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have led to higher sales and operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly increased sales in recent quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the beverage industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nA recent report by the Commerce Department highlighted a significant increase in consumer spending last month, indicating the economy\u2019s strength. Despite facing higher borrowing costs, the US continues to surpass other countries globally, largely due to its strong labor market. Matt Shay, the president of the National Retail Federation (NRF), said that the future direction of interest rates and inflation remains uncertain. However, he emphasized that a robust job market and rising real wages are still playing a crucial role in supporting spending. If we look at individual sectors through data provided by CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor, we see that sales of food and beverages increased by 1% month-over-month and showed a 5.3% rise compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe food and beverage industry has experienced significant growth over time. From embracing sustainable methods to integrating technology in operations, the industry is well-positioned for future expansion and growth. According to the Food and Beverages Global Market Report 2023, the global food and beverage industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.3% by 2027.\n\nWithin the beverage industry, the spirits segment maintained its lead in the market share over beer and wine for the second consecutive year in 2023. The US spirits revenue increased by 0.2%, reaching $37.7 billion, according to the annual economic report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the US (DISCUS). Even with modest revenue growth, the spirits industry outperformed beer and wine sales by 0.4% and 26.1%, respectively. The report also mentioned that the pre-mixed cocktails saw the most rapid growth among spirits categories last year, experiencing a 26.7% increase in revenue to reach $2.8 billion.\u00a0 Chris Swonger, president and CEO of DISCUS, spoke with CNBC about the performance of the beverage alcohol industry. He said that the spirits sector exhibited resilience, successfully sustaining its lead in the total beverage alcohol market. He further mentioned that the spirits market is now undergoing a period of adjustment.\n\nThe market witnessed the rise of tech stocks last year, which overshadowed nearly every other industry. While food and beverage stocks did not perform exceptionally, the S&P Food & Beverage Select Industry Index still managed to yield a modest return of 2.5%. The index tracks the performance of companies belonging to various food and beverage sub-industries. It is up by 3.12% this year, as of April 9. Due to the tech sector\u2019s strong performance last year and investors\u2019 consistent inclination toward the innovation it brings to the table, one would assume that these equities have consistently delivered strong returns over the years. While that could be true to some extent, the spotlight is now on Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\u2019s long-term returns. From 1994 to April 8, 2024, the stock has surged by an astounding 185,400%, making headlines for its remarkable growth. The California-based beverage company mainly specializes in energy drinks, alcohol, teas, and coffees.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a noticeable shift toward sustainability within the food and beverage industry. According to a survey conducted by Deloitte among food and beverage executives, products are expected to emphasize sustainable properties in 52% of cases, organic qualities in 36%, and healthy aspects in 35%. These attributes are closely associated with clean labeling and the avoidance of ultra-processed food. Moreover, three-quarters of companies support front-of-package nutritional labeling.\n\nWithin the beverage industry, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are some of the best stocks that also pay dividends to shareholders.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best dividend stocks with high upside potential. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their past performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks with High Upside Potential.\n\nThe current state of the US economy is uncertain with many analysts gravitating toward the idea of a recession occurring this year. Citi\u2019s chief US economist, Andrew Hollenhorst, highlighted significant challenges in his interview with CNBC, indicating that the country might fall into recession in the middle of 2024. He said that various factors like consumer weakness, high credit-card delinquency rates, and a weak labor market are indicators of deep-rooted issues within the economic landscape. In times like these, investors mainly focus on increasing their income-generating investments to ensure they have enough cash flow to sustain themselves. Dividend stocks offer reliability in this regard as these equities have proved their mettle in uncertain market conditions over the years.\n\nOne instance of the outperformance of dividend stocks occurred recently in 2022 when the S&P 500 declined by over 18% and dividend stocks experienced a relatively minor drop. The companies in the S&P 500 that paid dividends fell by 11.1% in 2022, while non-dividend payers plummeted by 38.7%. If we analyze historical data, we find that dividend stocks have maintained a stable performance over the long term as well. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited data from Hartford Funds, which reviewed the returns of dividend stocks from 1973 to 2023. The report mentioned that dividend-paying companies achieved an annual average return of 9.17% during this period, compared with a 4.27% annual average return of those that did not pay dividends. The report also mentioned that companies that maintained their dividends during this timeframe fared better than non-dividend payers but underperformed dividend payers, returning 6.74%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks that have been growing their dividends for years.\n\nAs mentioned above, income generation has always remained a top priority for investors, especially during certain market conditions. previous inflationary periods have brought dividend stocks into the limelight as these securities performed much better than their non-dividend counterparts. Hartford Funds did a detailed review of this performance and highlighted that in eight inflationary periods between 1970 and 2022, returns of dividend stocks have surpassed those of non-dividend stocks. The report further mentioned that the 1970s were a time of high inflation in the US, mainly due to rising oil prices. Dividends played an important role during this period, making up for nearly 73% of the S&P 500\u2019s overall returns. In addition to this, dividend stocks have also outpaced inflation over the past 150 years. According to our research from BlackRock, dividends from US companies have delivered an annual average growth rate of 3.7%, surpassing the average annual inflation rate of 2%.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks didn\u2019t perform as well as they did the year before, but analysts are still hopeful about their performance this year. This optimism comes from the fact that companies in the US distributed record amounts in dividends last year. According to a Dividend Forecast report by S&P Global, the US will contribute the most significant increase in annual dividends for the third consecutive year. The firm projects that an additional $28 billion will be distributed in 2024 across all 20 sectors, with an average growth rate of 6% in regular base dividends. This growth will partially be driven by companies that reinstated their dividends in 2023 following pandemic-related cuts. Considering analysts\u2019 positive dividend forecast, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks with huge upside potential. 12 Best Dividend Stocks with High-Upside Potential\n\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we first used a stock screener to identify dividend stocks with stable dividend yields and steady dividend histories.

In 2023, it used free cash flow to return $1.3 billion to shareholders, including repurchasing 9.1 million shares at an average price of $76.92 and $60o million in dividends from an annual payout of $2.60.\n\nWhile it could have done a better job buying back its shares, investors can be sure it\u2019s shareholder-friendly.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments in 2024 is the announcement that its Principal Alternative Credit business, which lends between $25 million and $200 million per transaction to middle market companies earning at least $5 million EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), reached $2 billion in borrower commitment.\n\nWith Clark set to earn significant amounts from her WNBA contract and non-playing endorsements, she\u2019d be the perfect Iowan to represent the company nationwide.\n\nStory continues\n\nCasey\u2019s General Stores (CASY) Image of Casey's General Store logo on side of a store\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nCasey\u2019s General Stores (NASDAQ:CASY) is based in Ankeny, Iowa, a suburb north of Des Moines.\n\nCasey\u2019s operates over 2,600 convenience stores and gas stations in 17 Midwestern states. Known for opening locations in smaller towns, 50% of its stores are in towns of 5,000 or less. Yet, it generated $3.33 billion in revenue in Q3 2024 with $114.5 million in pre-tax income. In the nine months ended Jan. 31, the company opened 118 net new stores, bringing its total to 2,639.\n\nAs the company points out in its Q3 2024 presentation, the convenience store industry remains fragmented, providing ongoing roll-up opportunities. In the past three years, Casey\u2019s has acquired 259 stores. With approximately 63% of the convenience stores in the U.S. owned by operators with between one and 10 locations, there\u2019s plenty of work left for it to do when it comes to consolidation.\n\nCasey\u2019s continues to grow its food business. In Q4 2024, its Prepared Food & Dispensed Beverage business increased by 11.4% to $349.1 million due to a 7.5% increase in same-store sales and a 3.9% increase related to store growth.\n\nI could see the company leveraging its excellent private label business to launch CC\u2019s, Caitlin Clark\u2019s favorite products she takes with her on the road to WNBA games.\n\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\nWorkiva (WK) An image of a laptop, tablet, and phone with various software and tech imagery on their screens\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWorkiva (NYSE:WK) is based in Ames, Iowa, the home of Clark\u2019s biggest rival, the Iowa State Cyclones.\n\n\u201cWorkiva offers the only unified SaaS platform that brings customers\u2019 financial reporting, Environmental, Social, and Governance, and Governance, Risk, and Compliance together in a controlled, secure, audit-ready platform,\u201d states its investor relations website.\n\nAlthough the B2B business might be less exciting than Nike\u2019s, its platform is something most businesses could use.\n\nInterestingly, all three companies I\u2019ve mentioned have good businesses, but their stocks have underperformed over the past five years. Workiva\u2019s stock is up 50.0%, about 24 percentage points less than the S&P 500. All three of them could use a little boost from Caitlin Clark\u2019s well-earned reputation as a leader.\n\nWorkiva\u2019s Q4 2023 presentation says its total addressable market is $12 billion in North America and $25 billion worldwide. Its revenue in 2023 was $630 million, or about 2.5% of its TAM, so it has plenty of room to grow.\n\nIn 2024, it expects to grow revenue to $720 million (14%) at the midpoint of its guidance. It won\u2019t make money on a GAAP basis this year\u2014it will lose $1.25 a share with a non-GAAP profit of $0.60\u2014but if it keeps adding customers as it did in 2023 (it had 311 customers who spent more than $300,000, 32% higher over 2022), it will get to GAAP profitability soon enough.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Collects $2.1 Billion in Dividends Every Year From These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "It\u2019s no secret Warren Buffett loves companies that pay dividends. While he refuses to allow Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) to pay any to shareholders, he enjoys collecting those checks from the businesses he owns.\n\nBuffett believes he can deliver superior returns for his shareholders if he allows them to make decisions for themselves. He\u2019s probably right. Since becoming chairman of Berkshire Hathaway in 1964, he has generated overall returns of 4,384,748% by the end of 2023. In contrast, the S&P 500 achieved over 31,000% returns. That means Buffett\u2019s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% beat the benchmark index by nearly two-to-one. Most investors will have a tough time doing that in one year. Buffett\u2019s done it for 60 years!\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha collected around $6 billion in dividends last year. That\u2019s without doing anything but holding onto the shares of companies he already owns. But that\u2019s only from his publicly traded stocks. In Buffett\u2019s 2020 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter, he revealed that his wholly owned railroad, BNSF, paid him $41.8 billion in dividends since it was acquired in 2010.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, which are Buffett\u2019s best dividend stocks? Based on the amount collected, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) will generate nearly $1 billion in dividends this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will deliver another $860 million. Yet I\u2019m looking for the top stocks, so I wanted dividends that yielded at least twice the average yield of the S&P 500\u2019s 1.4% yield. BAC stock just missed the cut at 2.7%, while AAPL pays a miserly 0.5%.\n\nThe following three Warren Buffett dividend stocks yield over 3% each and, in return, will mail Oracle $2.1 billion in checks this year.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPackaged food stock Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) is the seventh largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett owns 325.6 million shares worth $11.8 billion. With a yield of 4.4%, it is the highest-yielding stock in the portfolio, which is set to deliver $520.5 million in dividends.\n\nThat\u2019s not too shabby for a stock Buffett to consider a mistake. His holdings are the result of Buffett helping private equity firm 3G Capital Management to take control of H.J. Heinz in 2013 and then helping engineer the ketchup maker\u2019s acquisition of Kraft Foods two years later. While Buffett believes the Heinz deal was good, he feels he \u201coverpaid\u201d for Kraft.\n\nSince acquiring Heinz, Buffett\u2019s total return on the stock has been less than 18% compared to a 344% return by the S&P 500. The company owns a portfolio of top name brands like Kraft and Heinz and Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Maxwell House coffee. Half a million dollars a year in dividends can soften the blow of paltry returns and Buffett says he will never sell KHC stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nIt\u2019s likely no surprise Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is on the list since it\u2019s been known for years as a cash-producing machine. Buffett famously bought the beverage giant\u2019s stock after Coca-Cola sent him a can of Cherry Coke in the 1980s. He ended up selling out of his Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) holdings and today owns 400 million shares of Coke worth $23.5 billion. That\u2019s a 9.3% share of the company, accounting for over 6% of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nKO stock yields 3.3%, so Buffett will receive dividend checks this year amounting to $775.6 million from the soda king. Of course, Coca-Cola is much more than just a soda jerk today; it has a broad swath of the beverage market, including water, tea, juices and energy drinks.\n\nAlthough Buffett doesn\u2019t really buy and sell the company\u2019s shares anymore, preferring to just hold for the long term, Coke tends to be an all-weather stock. Cans of soda and other beverages are indulgences consumers will enjoy regardless of economic conditions. This is why it continues to thrive, and Buffett will likely never sell his holdings.\n\nChevron (CVX) Here's Why Investors Should be Bullish on Chevron Stock at Current Levels\n\nSource: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe brightest dividend star in Berkshire Hathaway has to be oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Buffett owns over 126 million shares valued at $20.5 billion. That puts the oil stock fifth in the portfolio.\n\nBuffett was selling shares of the energy company last year as he scooped up more shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) because of its position in the Permian basin. But in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, he became a buyer again. Chevron is also a giant in the oil-rich Permian and its pending acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES) will give it access to the lucrative Guyana market (that is, if Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) doesn\u2019t muck it up).\n\nWith CVX stock yielding 4% a year, Buffett stands to receive $822 million in dividends this year. This will be an income stream that goes on for years and years as fossil fuel demand continues to grow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in KO, XOM and CVX stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years.

        "title": "Will Strategies Help Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) Beat on Q3 Earnings?",
        "content": "The Procter & Gamble Company PG is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Apr 18, before the opening bell. The company is expected to have witnessed sales and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s fiscal third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.42 per share, indicating a 3.7% increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For fiscal third-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.5 billion, suggesting a 2.1% rise from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nIn the last reported quarter, the company recorded an earnings surprise of 8.2%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 5.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nProcter & Gamble has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. The company\u2019s focus on productivity and cost-saving plans positions it to drive margins in the near term. Continued business investments also bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company has been demonstrating its dominance in the global market by strategically leveraging its brand strength to drive organic sales growth. As a manufacturer of products catering to the daily needs of consumers worldwide, P&G's success in the preceding quarters can be attributed to its robust brand portfolio and effective business strategies. The persistence of these trends is expected to get reflected in the company\u2019s organic sales for the fiscal third quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expect organic sales to increase 4.4% in the to-be-reported quarter. Organic sales are expected to rise 3% for Beauty, 8% for Grooming, 6% for Health Care, and 4% each for the Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments.\r\n\r\nP&G has been diligently pursuing cost-saving and productivity measures to drive margins and reinforce its competitive advantage. The company's commitment to enhancing productivity, while mitigating macro cost headwinds has been integral to maintaining a balanced top and bottom-line growth. Its focus on productivity and cost-saving plans are likely to have boosted margins in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expect P&G's core gross margin for the fiscal third quarter to have been influenced by significant productivity savings. Our model predicts a core gross margin expansion of 80 bps for the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n \r\nHowever, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have partly weighed on the fiscal third-quarter performance. Additionally, Procter & Gamble has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses due to higher supply-chain costs, rising inflation and elevated transportation expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the last reported quarter\u2019s earnings call, management expected ongoing supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation to continue to impact consumer confidence throughout fiscal 2024. The persistence of these headwinds is likely to get reflected in the company\u2019s bottom-line results to some extent.\r\n\r\nOur estimate indicates a 2% impact from currency headwinds in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, our estimate for core SG&A expenses of $5.8 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 6.2%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses are estimated to reflect a 90-bps increase from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure. Consequently, our model suggests a 10-bps operating margin decline to 21.1% for the fiscal third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter & Gamble this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nProcter & Gamble has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +0.28%.\n\nStocks With Favorable Combination\n\nHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around.\r\n\r\nColgate-Palmolive CL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.42% and a Zacks Rank #2. CL is anticipated to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter 2024 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.95 billion, indicating an increase of 3.7% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate\u2019s bottom line has been unchanged in the past 30 days at 82 cents per share. The consensus estimate for earnings suggests a rise of 12.3% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure. CL has delivered an earnings beat of 4.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nCoty COTY currently has an Earnings ESP of +12.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COTY\u2019s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.37 billion, which suggests an increase of 6.4% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for COTY\u2019s quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 6 cents in the past 30 days, suggesting a 68.4% decline from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported number. COTY has delivered an earnings beat of 115.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo PEP has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports first-quarter 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $18.2 billion, which suggests growth of 1.7% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo\u2019s quarterly earnings has been unchanged in the past 30 days at $1.52 per share. The consensus estimate for earnings suggests an improvement of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights PepsiCo, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, MercadoLibre, Lululemon Athletica, and Manulife Financial",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 15, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. CP, MercadoLibre, Inc. MELI, Lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, and Manulife Financial Corp. MFC.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Stock Reports for PepsiCo, Canadian Pacific Kansas City and MercadoLibre\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including PepsiCo, Inc., Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. and MercadoLibre, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of PepsiCo have underperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (-6.0% vs. -3.9%). The company witnessed soft volume trends across both businesses, which impacted reported revenues in the fourth quarter. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, PepsiCo banks on strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. These factors along with robust pricing aided PepsiCo\u2019s earnings and organic revenues in the fourth-quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nThe company witnessed organic revenue growth across the global beverage and convenient food businesses. Additionally, the company\u2019s productivity and cost-management initiatives bode well. For 2024, PEP expects to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 4%.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here >>>)\r\n\r\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the year-to-date period (+9.4% vs. +3.3%). Following the approval of the merger with Kansas City Southern, the company is known as Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited. The deal is anticipated to draw synergies (annually) of $1 billion within three years.\r\n\r\nThe merged entity has started to offer a daily premium intermodal service between the U.S. Midwest and Mexico. The Zacks analyst is impressed with Canadian Pacific Kansas City's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the flip side, high operating expenses continue to weigh on the company's bottom line. Elevated fuel costs are leading to increased operating expenses.\r\n\r\nEven though fuel prices have come down from the highs witnessed earlier, the same remains at an elevated level. High debt levels are worrisome as well. Canadian Pacific Kansas City does not have enough cash to meet its current debt levels.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Canadian Pacific Kansas City here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of MercadoLibre have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date basis (-4.3% vs. +14.1%).

        "title": "Cheetos\u00ae Debuts 'Other Hand' Campaign, an Official Celebration of Fans who Reserve their Dominant Hand for Enjoying Cheetos",
        "content": "NBA superstar Jamal Murray joins Cheetos to spotlight the mischievous mishaps that happen in real life when snackers' dominant hands are covered in Cheetle dust\n\nPLANO, Texas, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ninety-nine percent of people eat Cheetos\u00ae with their dominant hand, which means they need to live their life using their Other Hand... even if things get a little messy. Now, Cheetos officially celebrates those Cheetos lovers who have committed their dominant hand to solely eating their favorite snack with the launch of the Other Hand campaign. Through a series of new digital spots, advertising stunts and a partnership with 2023 NBA Champion and Cheetos fan Jamal Murray, the brand shows the antics that happen when snackers attempt to use their non-dominant hand because they don't want to stop eating Cheetos.\n\n\"Cheetos fans everywhere know the feeling when they need to get things done but their fingers are covered in that beloved orange Cheetle dust,\" said Tina Mahal, senior vice president of marketing, PepsiCo Foods North America. \"Instead of putting the Cheetos bag down, they try out their Other Hand, and things often go hilariously 'wrong.' From missing high-fives to daily task mishaps, this campaign is an ode to the fans who will do anything for their favorite snack. We're showing the world that it's okay to use your Other Hand and embrace the mess.\"\n\nTo kick off the campaign, Cheetos teamed up with Denver Nuggets point guard Jamal Murray to put his Other Hand to the test. Murray, like many other Cheetos enthusiasts, often needs to use his Other Hand while his dominant hand helps him enjoy that cheesy goodness. In fact, fans may have noticed that his recent high-fives have been a little\u2026 off. From slight misses to huge whiffs, Murray's recurring high-five mishaps during games are part of his playful dedication to the Other Hand lifestyle. Fans can watch here how Murray's constant use of his non-dominant hand off the court landed him in some amusing situations on the court.\n\n\"It's no secret that I'm a Cheetos fan,\" said Murray. \"Using my Other Hand often leads to some funny, often messy, things happening, like missing high-fives. I'm excited to team up with the brand to embrace the mischief and celebrate those moments that Cheetos fans like me know all too well.\"\n\nThe missed high-five is just one of many examples that showcase what happens while people enjoy life with Cheetle-covered fingers. Fans can also see this come to life in Cheetos' new digital advertisements launching today here. The advertising campaign features five spots, each showcasing the over-the-top fails people experience when they simply can't let go of Cheetos: a baker botching a birthday cake, an artist creating a distorted forensic sketch, sports fans giving missing celebratory high-fives, a plastic surgeon mishap and a football player unable to make a decent pass.\n\nStory continues\n\nCheetos took the mischief to the streets with various out-of-home advertisements across the country, spotlighting everyday people \u2013 from copywriters to drivers \u2013 giving up precision to keep their Cheetos-eating hand focused on snacking. These stunts included a less-than-perfect parking job in New York City and a New York Times ad riddled with grammatical errors to further highlight the sacrifices made for snack satisfaction.\n\nFans are invited to join in on the fun by sharing their own Other Hand-induced escapades on social media platforms using the hashtag #CheetosOtherHand.

        "content": "Friday, April 12, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP), Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (CP) and MercadoLibre, Inc. (MELI). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nShares of PepsiCo have underperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (-6.0% vs. -3.9%). The company witnessed soft volume trends across both businesses, which impacted reported revenues in the fourth quarter. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, PepsiCo banks on strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. These factors along with robust pricing aided PepsiCo\u2019s earnings and organic revenues fourth-quarter 2023.\r\n\r\nThe company witnessed organic revenue growth across the global beverage and convenient food businesses. Additionally, the company\u2019s productivity and cost-management initiatives bode well. For 2024, PEP expects to deliver organic revenues revenue growth of at least 4%.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here >>>)\r\n\r\nCanadian Pacific Kansas City shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry over the year-to-date period (+9.4% vs. +3.3%). Following the approval of the merger with Kansas City Southern, the company is known as Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited. The deal is anticipated to draw synergies (annually) of $1 billion within three years.\r\n\r\nThe merged entity has started to offer a daily premium intermodal service between the U.S. Midwest and Mexico. The Zacks analyst is impressed with Canadian Pacific Kansas City's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the flip side, high operating expenses continue to weigh on the company's bottom line. Elevated fuel costs are leading to increased operating expenses.\r\n\r\nEven though fuel prices have come down from the highs witnessed earlier, the same remains at an elevated level. High debt levels are worrisome as well. Canadian Pacific Kansas City does not have enough cash to meet its current debt levels.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Canadian Pacific Kansas City here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of MercadoLibre have underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date basis (-4.3% vs. +14.1%). The company\u2019s mounting expenses related to warehousing and mPOS discounts is a major headwind. Rising e-commerce competition from players like Amazon & Rakuten remains a concern.\r\n\r\nNevertheles, MercadoLibre is benefiting from accelerating commerce and fintech revenues. Rising gross merchandise volume (GMV) is acting as a key catalyst. Strong momentum across the company's advertising services is a major positive. Strengthening shipment growth is also contributing well to its top-line growth.\r\n\r\nIncreasing total payment volume (TPV), courtesy of the robust Mercado Pago, is another positive. Growing momentum across the MELI+ loyalty program and its expanding credit card offerings are acting as tailwinds. Solid uptake of online-to-offline offerings is a plus.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on MercadoLibre here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hess Corporation (HES), Lululemon Athletica Inc.

        "title": "Why Investors Need to Take Advantage of These 2 Consumer Staples Stocks Now",
        "content": "Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\n\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\n\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Hershey (HSY) earns a Zacks Rank #3 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 3, 2024, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.78 a share.\n\nHSY has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.01%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.78 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72.\n\nHSY is part of a big group of Consumer Staples stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at PepsiCo (PEP) as well.\n\nPepsiCo, which is readying to report earnings on April 23, 2024, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.52 a share, and PEP is 11 days out from its next earnings report.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo is $1.52, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HSY and PEP could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\n\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\n\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

        "content": "With stocks running into a bit of a speed bump this week, with the S&P 500 falling below the 5,200 mark again, some tech-heavy investors may wonder if now\u2019s a good time to play some defense. Just because the broader markets are feeling weighed down doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t individual stocks that can shrug off the volatility and find the means to move higher.\n\nThe consumer-packaged foods scene holds some overlooked and potentially undervalued stocks that may have what it takes to fare better as red-hot CPI (consumer price index) data puts this year\u2019s expected rate hikes on ice.\n\nThough it\u2019s comforting to know that the Federal Reserve\u2019s next move will probably be a cut, there\u2019s some risk that market participants\u2019 rate cut expectations may be too high. For some overheated areas in the tech sector, fewer cuts may set the stage for tougher sledding for the rest of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe good news is some of the improving consumer-packaged goods plays seem insulated (and cheap) enough to make it through a potential rough patch without getting battered. Let\u2019s check out three affordable consumer staples that may have what it takes to gain, even if the rest of the market is in for some consolidation.\n\nMondelez (MDLZ) The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glass\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a top sweets play that could add a bit of sweetness to your portfolio as the hot start to 2024 begins to cool off, along with the scorching tech sector. After retreating nearly 14% from their early February peak, shares of the $89.7 billion confectionary firm look like they\u2019re headed for a roundtrip right back to the lows of October 2023.\n\nIndeed, there are notable headwinds (soaring cocoa prices and the sweets-curbing effects of Ozempic and Wegovy) to keep on one\u2019s radar. However, many are already baked into the stock right here at $66 and change. Moving ahead, effective cost controls and product innovation are key as the firm looks to maintain demand even as it raises prices by a high single-digit percentage in 2024.\n\nSure, consumers are fed up with inflation, but either higher prices in response to scorching cocoa prices or margins could take a considerable hit. The good news is Mondelez\u2019s chocolate peers will be feeling the same pinch, so those with chocolate cravings will need to pay up either way.\n\nGoing for 18.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), with a decent 2.51% dividend yield, Mondelez stands out as a neglected consumer-packaged goods play that\u2019s rich, not just with calories but value.\n\nPepsi (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) is a heavyweight champ in the consumer-packaged goods space, with its flagship cola and a robust portfolio of salty and savory snacks. Like most other inflation-rattled consumer staple stocks, PEP stock is in a rut, now down 14% from its May 2023 high. With an even sweeter dividend yield of 2.97%, the $232.2 billion behemoth is definitely worth consideration for those looking to play defense in spite of the pressures hitting the industry.\n\nCompared to Mondelez and many other quality packaged-goods plays, you\u2019ll pay a lofty price for admission. Today, the stock trades at 25.8 times trailing P/E. Not a cheap multiple for a company that\u2019s experiencing a drastic stall in sales growth. Last week, PEP stock got slapped with a downgrade from Argus over growth concerns. A number of concerns, like inflation and weight-loss drugs, contributed to the major downgrade.\n\nOn the plus side, beverage makers have been investing in automation efforts. Such investments should lead to sustained long-term margin enhancement and give lift to PEP stock over the longer term.\n\nKellanova (K) Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in Mississauga\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nKellanova (NYSE:K) is the snack-focused arm of Kellogg that stands to do a whole lot better now as it focuses on convenience and great taste following its spin-off from Kellogg. Looking ahead, Kellanova is taking the initiative when it comes to technological innovation.\n\nWith investments in the digital supply chain, data analytics, and even machine learning, Kellanova may sound like more of an AI-driven tech company than a maker of tasty cereal bars. In any case, expect its tech priorities will help it drive margins and sales growth, even amid turbulent macro conditions.\n\nAt writing, K stock is trading for 25.34 times trailing P/E, slightly less than PEP stock. With a similar dividend yield of 3.92% and the potential to grow from recent tech efforts, I\u2019d have to go with Kellanova over Pepsi for those looking to get a jump on the packaged foods scene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PepsiCo's (PEP) Productivity &amp; Cost-Saving Initiatives Bode Well",
        "content": "PepsiCo Inc. PEP has persistently showcased the benefits of stringent cost-saving actions and focus on productivity improvements. These actions have gone a long way in bolstering PEP\u2019s margin performance, along with continued focus on expansion.\r\n\r\nThe company has been focused on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by driving down costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. The company expects to achieve its productivity goals through savings generated from its restructuring actions. These actions are likely to position it to further simplify, synchronize and automate processes; re-engineer the go-to-market and information systems; simplify the organization; and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint.\r\n\r\nSavings from the productivity and restructuring plans should help drive the top line and margins. In 2024, the company anticipates elevating its focus on holistic cost-management initiatives to boost productivity and use these savings to mitigate cost inflation and prioritize investments in its brands, innovation, and channel expansion.\r\n\r\nGains from PepsiCo\u2019s cost-management initiatives were well-reflected by its improved margins in fourth-quarter 2024. On a consolidated basis, the company\u2019s reported gross profit increased 1.2% year over year in the quarter, while core gross profit rose 1.3%. The reported gross margin expanded 91 basis points (bps), whereas the core gross margin expanded 97 bps.\r\n\r\nPEP\u2019s reported operating income rose 106% year over year. The core operating income grew 8.7% year over year and the core constant-currency operating income improved 10%. The reported operating margin expanded 313 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 97 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply-chain and distribution efficiencies, partially offset by ongoing inflationary pressures and planned business investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Factors Driving Growth\n\nPepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends. Additionally, pricing gains, driven by strong realized prices across all segments, have been key drivers.\r\n\r\nNotably, effective net pricing improved 9% year over year in fourth-quarter 2023. Driven by the pricing gains and growth across categories and geographies, organic revenues grew 4.5% year over year in the fourth quarter. PepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter core EPS of $1.78 increased 6.6% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 9% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives.\n\nPeer Comparisons\n\nThe company shares space with The Coca-Cola Company KO, Monster Beverage Corp. MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP in the Beverages \u2013 Soft Drinks industry.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, the leading global beverage giant, is on track with its strategy of becoming a total beverage company, through last year\u2019s streamlining of its portfolio, focusing on the core brands, and investing in its portfolio of brands to meet the evolving needs of consumers. It is focused on diversifying its portfolio to tap into the rapidly growing RTD alcohol beverages category as part of its innovation strategy.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola has been witnessing positive business trends in the past quarters, thanks to strong revenue growth across most of its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and increased concentrate sales.\r\n\r\nMonster Beverage, based in Corona, CA, is a marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages. The company\u2019s continued momentum in the energy drinks category remains a key growth driver. Monster Beverage is witnessing robust margin trends, driven by the easing of supply-chain headwinds, particularly reduced freight costs. Additionally, the company continues to benefit from its pricing actions across various regions to negate the impacts of rising commodity costs and inflation.\r\n\r\nKeurig Dr Pepper is a beverage and coffee company in the United States and Canada, with annual revenues of more than $14 billion. Keurig Dr Pepper has been witnessing continued momentum in the Refreshment Beverages segment, which is aiding the top line. Continued brand strength and significant pricing have also been the key drivers.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) closed at $168.95 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.97% move from the prior day. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.95%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.09%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.84%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 3.69% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.78% in that time.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming release. The company is slated to reveal its earnings on April 23, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.52, up 1.33% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $18.16 billion, up 1.74% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $8.15 per share and a revenue of $94.64 billion, signifying shifts of +6.96% and +3.46%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state. PepsiCo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also note PepsiCo's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 20.92. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 18.66.\n\nWe can also see that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.67. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Beverages - Soft drinks industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.26.\n\nThe Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 38, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Dividend Stocks to Double Up on Right Now",
        "content": "It's comforting for investors to receive regular dividends. Payouts can provide a source of income that appeals to a variety of investors. But it's important to look beyond a stock's dividend yield. That's because a high yield may have been caused by a stock price drop due to a company running into difficulties, and the board of directors may cut the payout.\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) have increased dividends annually for more than half a century. This impressive feat makes them Dividend Kings. While this shows that they prioritize dividends, do they have the wherewithal to continue doing so? It's time to analyze each business to make that determination. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo sells a wide swath of popular foods, snacks, and beverages known to most consumers. These include names like Doritos, Quaker, Pepsi, and Gatorade, which not only have strong brand recognition, but also continue to generate profit growth.\n\nAfter adjusting for certain items, such as foreign exchange translations, earnings per share grew 14% last year. This, in turn, has led to solid free-cash-flow (FCF) generation. PepsiCo's FCF was $7.9 billion last year, and it paid $6.7 billion in dividends.\n\nMore importantly, the board of directors signaled confidence in PepsiCo's prospects when it announced a 7% dividend increase earlier this year to an annualized $5.42. That made it 52 straight years that the board has increased payments. The stock's 3% dividend yield is more than double the S&P 500's 1.4%.\n\nPepsiCo's stock price has lost over 8% in the past year in contrast to the S&P 500's nearly 27% gain. While revenue has grown, product volumes have dropped. As inflationary pressures have dropped, higher volumes should return over time, however.\n\n2. Procter & Gamble\n\nThere's a good chance you've shopped for Procter & Gamble products and have them somewhere in your home. That's because it sells everyday items like shampoo, razors, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and diapers under brands like Head & Shoulders, Gillette, Crest, Tide, and Pampers. It has a high-market share in several product categories.\n\nStory continues\n\nFortunately, these products have stable demand throughout the economic cycle. That's allowed Procter & Gamble to pay dividends for 133 years and increase them for the last 67 years. There aren't many companies that can make that claim.\n\nIt has a 62% payout ratio. While that may seem high, it's perfectly acceptable given the company's stable business. The ratio has hovered around the 60% range for the past three years. The stock's 2.4% dividend yield is 1 percentage point higher than the S&P 500's yield.\n\nAdjusted sales for the fiscal second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023) grew 4%, but earnings increased 16%. Certainly, you can find faster-growing companies, but for dividend-seeking investors, this mature business continues to generate plenty of FCF. During the first half of the year, Procter & Gamble's FCF totaled $8.3 billion, which was more than plenty to pay the $1.7 billion in dividends.\n\nPepsiCo and Procter & Gamble may not be the flashiest stocks. But I think you'll find these reliable cash-flow generators, which continue to increase dividends every year, very satisfying to own.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "2 Large-Cap Stocks to Watch in April 2024",
        "content": "Investing in large-cap stocks is often an ideal investment strategy. Generally, large-cap companies are defined as those with a market cap of more than $10 billion. Due to their massive size, these companies enjoy wide competitive moats, pricing power, and stable cash flows. Hence, the best large-cap stocks have the potential to outpace the broader markets and deliver game-changing returns to shareholders over time. Two large-cap stocks to watch now are Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).\n\nI am bullish on both these companies due to their growing earnings, consistent dividend hikes, and recession-resistant businesses. See how the two companies compare using TipRanks\u2019 comparison tool below.\n\nPepsi Is Well-Diversified\n\nValued at $232.5 billion, Pepsi is among the most recognizable brands in the world. Pepsi owns and operates a diversified business that includes beverages, snacks, and food. It also has operations in several countries, providing investors with regional or geographic diversification.\n\nPepsi owns brands such as Tropicana, Lays, Fritos, and Cheetos. Moreover, the company provides insights into these segments, as it breaks out quarterly numbers for businesses such as Frito-Lay (snacking) and Quaker Oats (food items). In 2023, these two segments accounted for 31% of total revenue and 60% of its operating profit.\n\nPepsi expects its international business to be a key driver of top-line growth in the upcoming decade. In 2023, its international sales surged over $40 billion, allowing Pepsi to benefit from economies of scale and higher margins in these markets.\n\nPepsi\u2019s Dividend Is Growing\n\nPepsi stock has almost tripled in the last decade and yet offers shareholders a tasty dividend yield of nearly 3%. It currently pays shareholders a quarterly dividend of $1.265 per share, and these payouts have risen by almost 11% annually in the last two decades.\n\nPepsi has raised dividends for 52 consecutive years, which is remarkable and showcases the predictable nature of the company\u2019s cash flow. Similar to other fast-moving goods companies, Pepsi is fairly recession-resistant and thrives across business cycles.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsi increased its free cash flow by 39% to $8.1 billion in 2023, and it paid $6.6 billion to shareholders via dividends, indicating a payout ratio of 81.5%. While the payout ratio might seem high, Pepsi still has the flexibility to target accretive acquisitions and strengthen its balance sheet, driving future cash flows and dividends higher.\n\nThe company grew its sales by 10% and earnings by 14% year-over-year in 2023. In 2024, it expects sales to rise by 4% while earnings growth is forecast at 8%. Priced at 20.8x forward earnings, PEP stock trades at a premium, given the valuation for peers is lower at 17.6x. Still, Pepsi\u2019s brand value, widening portfolio of products, and growing earnings base allow it to command a high valuation.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for PEP Stock?\n\nOut of the 17 analyst ratings given to PEP stock, 11 are Buys, six are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average PEP stock price target is $190.65, indicating upside potential of 12.45% from current levels.\n\nStarbucks Has Delivered Strong Returns\n\nAnother global brand, Starbucks, has returned more than 1,000% to shareholders in the last 20 years, easily outpacing the broader market in this period. Despite its outperformance, Starbucks offers shareholders a dividend yield of more than 2.6%, as it trades close to 52-week lows.\n\nStarbucks\u2019 brand proposition gives it an economic moat in terms of pricing power, allowing the coffee giant to offset headwinds such as inflation. In the last five decades, Starbucks has opened close to 39,000 stores. However, its growth story is far from over, as the company plans to open 55,000 stores by the end of this decade.\n\nIts ongoing expansion should help Starbucks boost its earnings and drive dividends higher, something it has done for 13 consecutive years. Starbucks pays shareholders an annual dividend of $2.28 per share, and these payouts have more than tripled in the last nine years.\n\nArmed with a loyal customer base of 34 million members, Starbucks ended the recent quarter with a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 63%. This shows that Starbucks is resourceful in using its capital to expand in the U.S. and other international markets.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for SBUX Stock?\n\nOut of the 25 analyst ratings given to SBUX stock, 10 are Buys, 15 are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average SBUX stock price target is $107.30, indicating upside potential of 23.1% from current levels.\n\nWall Street expects Starbucks to grow its earnings from $3.54 per share in Fiscal 2023 (ended in September) to $4.05 per share in Fiscal 2024 and $4.71 per share in Fiscal 2025. So, SBUX stock is priced at around 22x forward earnings, which might seem expensive given that the industry average is lower at 15.8x. However, SBUX is forecast to grow the bottom line at a far higher pace. Therefore, it warrants a lofty valuation.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nPepsi and Starbucks are both growing at a steady rate and might not deliver market-beating returns each year. However, they should help shareholders outpace inflation and benefit from higher dividends in the upcoming decade, which enhances the yield-at-cost significantly.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Brazil Cocoa Farms Go High-Tech to Upgrade Ailing Market",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Valuable cocoa beans pour from the pipe of what looks like a small train making its way through tropical fruit trees in Brazil, leaving only husks on the ground.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRBC Fires CFO Ahn After Probe Into Personal Relationship Trumpism Is Emptying Churches Saudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neom Turkey Joins NATO Allies in Suspending Europe Arms Treaty Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Wealth Exceeds Elon Musk\u2019s for the First Time Since 2020\n\nThe machine is bringing automation to the husking of ripe cocoa pods \u2014 a significant improvement over the traditional labor-intensive harvesting process of picking fruit from trees and manually cutting through the stalks with a blade.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an effort by agricultural powerhouse Brazil to lead the way to a dramatic modernization of cocoa production methods, helping to spur an industry revival in the country. More broadly, the shift may bring much-needed assistance to global markets facing severe bean shortages from top growers in West Africa.\n\nCocoa prices have more than doubled this year to a record as extreme weather, disease and structural issues have hurt supplies from Ivory Coast and Ghana. Cocoa futures in New York settled at $9,312 per ton on Friday, climbing roughly 3%. Low pay has hampered farmers\u2019 ability to invest in improvements, limiting how much cocoa their trees can yield. That\u2019s bringing more global attention to Brazil, which has plenty of agricultural know-how and farmers with financial resources to invest in new crops.\n\n\u201cThe production model in Africa tends to run out of steam over time, and that creates possibilities for other regions,\u201d said Laerte Moraes, a managing director for Cargill Inc.\u2019s South American food ingredients unit. \u201cBrazil has all the conditions to be a very efficient and effective cocoa producer.\u201d\n\nThe giant trading company is among the groups working with new technology to grow cocoa in atypical areas in Brazil. After a recent agreement with farmers from the savanna region of Cerrado, Cargill is now in talks with chocolate makers, looking to build partnerships with farmers for a next phase in cocoa investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nBrazil produces less than 5% of global cocoa supplies, and is currently a net importer of beans. Once a prominent global supplier, the South American nation lost it all to a tree-killing disease known as witches\u2019 broom that decimated crops in the 1980s.\n\nBrazil, where the main television channel is updating an 1990s telenovela about cocoa farmers, is set on a revival. The country\u2019s cocoa commission Ceplac is seeking to roughly double output to more than 440,000 tons a year by 2030. While still far from top supplier Ivory Coast, that would turn Brazil into one of the top producing countries, likely surpassing Nigeria and Cameroon.\n\nPreviously, Brazil used production methods that confined cocoa to a few small, more humid areas under the shadows of taller native trees. Now, the new machines can operate under bright sunlight and on plain land slots.\n\nCombined with better irrigation and large use of fertilizer and pesticides, as well as the selection of tree seedlings that can resist exposure to sunlight, producers are betting they can make cocoa crops more productive, and more resistant to disease and extreme weather.\n\nSeveral farmers working with the new techniques say productivity can reach about 3,000 kilograms per hectare, much higher than the national average of 491 kilograms per hectare.\n\nWidespread irrigation is allowing cocoa planting in dryer areas \u2014 similar to an expansion with soybeans and corn in the same regions that helped Brazil become a major exporter of those commodities.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who are new to the cocoa industry are starting to explore it,\u201d said agronomist Silvino Kruschewsky Neto, who consults for several farms in the country. \u201cThey have a very well-formed business vision, and a culture that dictates the crop has to be productive and adopt technology.\u201d\n\nFarming group Agr\u00edcola DM4 in the southern part of Bahia state is using the train-like harvesting machine to reduce costs. On a farm that also grows black pepper and coffee, cocoa is expanding faster than initially planned as surging prices mean the crop is becoming more profitable, according to Fernando De Martins, chief executive officer of the group.\n\n\u201cProducers are motivated to plant even more,\u201d De Martins said. \u201cThe cocoa price level has changed, and I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll see low prices for the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nRead More: Why Cocoa Prices Spiked, What It Means for Consumers:\n\nEven PepsiCo Inc. is upbeat about cocoa in Brazil. The company \u2014 which uses cocoa in an instant chocolate drink that\u2019s popular in Brazil \u2014 saw good results after trying cocoa plantations in combination with coconut trees located at some of Brazil\u2019s driest regions.\n\n\u201cThe vitality of cocoa plants surprises even the experts,\u201d said Ricardo Tinoco, an agronomist at the company. Pepsi is considering expansion across 450 hectares (1,112 acres) on one farm it owns, and could also take cocoa to some farms in the region that supply it with coconut water.\n\nSimilar results were seen at Schmidt Agricola, the company that partnered with Cargill two years ago to foster new techniques for cocoa. The crop development has been encouraging, with an \u201cabnormal\u201d amount of fruit already developing in the trees, Cargill\u2019s Moraes said.\n\nWhile it will take time before some of the more recently planted areas start bearing fruit, the new farming methods are starting to get the world\u2019s attention as global markets seek alternative cocoa suppliers.\n\n\u201cBrazil has turned into the talk of the town,\u201d De Martins said.\n\n(Updates with Friday\u2019s cocoa price in fourth paragraph. An earlier version corrected the location of the farm in the 14th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 12 best low-risk investments in April 2024. To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Low-Risk Investments in April 2024.\n\nThe stock market in 2024 presents a stark contrast to the landscape investors encountered at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and in its immediate aftermath. Pre-pandemic, global stocks exhibited robust performance, fueling speculation that America's reign as a global economic powerhouse might be waning, with emerging players like China poised to challenge U.S. dominance. More prevalently, inflation continued to rise in February, maintaining the Federal Reserve's trajectory to delay any interest rate cuts until at least the summer.\n\nIn addition, a string of concerning developments began on March 11 with a New York Federal Reserve survey revealing an acceleration in consumer expectations over the longer term in February, with additional reports showing a 3.2% year-over-year increase in consumer prices. Finally, on March 14, concerns heightened further with the release of data indicating rising pipeline pressures at the wholesale level. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report added to the inflation worries, revealing a 0.6% increase in the producer price index for February, double the Dow Jones estimate.\n\nHowever, given the American economy's continued outperformance compared to global peers, the Federal Reserve has greater flexibility to maintain higher rates. This strategy aims to temper Wall Street's reliance on easy money, a trend that emerged following the 2008 Great Recession and the recent coronavirus pandemic. In February 2024, the flagship Wall Street stock index, comprising the pinnacle of the American stock market, reached a milestone by surpassing 5,000 points for the first time. This marks a significant departure from late 2022 when widespread speculation suggested an impending recession, prompting cautious preparations from investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, committed long-term investors tend not to focus too much on sudden changes like these. Rather than being swayed by rapid changes and uncertainties, they opt to invest in shares of reliable companies known for their consistent performance, assessed over extended periods often spanning years or even decades. While the allure of investing in entirely risk-free stocks may be enticing, the reality is that no stock can guarantee 100% safety. However, it\u2019s worth noting that certain stocks, including names like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), are notably more secure than others, thus making them some of the best low-risk investments out these. Low Risk Stocks to Buy in April 2024\n\nA close-up of a computer monitor displaying real-time financial data on the stock market.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nOur process for shortlisting stocks for April 2024 involved several criteria: we looked for stocks with a beta value of less than 1.0, strong fundamentals, positive analyst ratings, and positive analyst price targets as of March 27. We then narrowed down our selection by excluding midcap or lower companies and stocks lacking stable and resilient dividend payouts. The remaining stocks were evaluated using Insider Monkey's database of elite hedge funds tracked as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The top 12 stocks based on hedge fund sentiment, ranked in ascending order of hedge fund shareholders, have been included on our list.\n\nHedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n12. General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40\n\nBeta Value: 0.14\n\nGeneral Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) is a prominent American multinational company renowned for its production and marketing of branded processed consumer foods, widely distributed through retail channels. The company's origins can be traced back to its establishment near Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, along the Mississippi River, where it initially gained prominence as a significant flour milling operation.\n\nAs of the end of Q4 2023, Insider Monkey's database indicated that 40 hedge fund investors had allocated their investments to General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS). The largest shareholder of General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) was John Overdeck And David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors, holding approximately 3.48 million shares valued at about $226.99 million.\n\nMuch like Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) is one of the best low-risk investments in April 2024.\n\n11. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\n\nBeta Value: 0.41\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a multinational corporation headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, situated on Park Avenue. The company specializes in manufacturing, distributing, and providing a diverse array of household, healthcare, personal care, and veterinary products.\n\nWith a dividend growth streak extending over 61 years, CL stands out as one of the premier low-risk investments in the market. Presently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, boasting a dividend yield of 2.22% as recorded on March 27.\n\nAs of the close of Q4 2023, 54 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $3 billion in total. First Eagle Investment Management owned roughly 11 million CL shares, becoming the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q4.\n\n10. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 57\n\nBeta Value: 0.77\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates a global network of membership warehouses, primarily under the \"Costco Wholesale\" brand, offering high-quality, brand-name products at significantly lower prices compared to traditional wholesale or retail outlets.\n\nAs of March 27, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) offers a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 0.56%. The company has demonstrated a consistent commitment to rewarding shareholders by increasing its dividend for the past 19 years.\n\nAccording to data from Insider Monkey, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was included in 57 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q4 2023, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. The stakes held by these hedge funds have a combined value of over $4 billion.\n\n9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 62\n\nBeta Value: 0.59\n\nWidely recognized as one of the best low-risk investments, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands as a renowned multinational American corporation renowned for its production of the iconic beverage, Coca-Cola. Beyond its flagship product, the company actively participates in the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of a diverse range of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates, syrups, and notably, alcoholic beverages within the beverage industry.\n\nOn December 13, investment advisory firm Citi maintained a Buy rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stock and raised the price target to $67 from $65.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds had stakes in Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO).\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its\u00a0third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n8. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 64\n\nBeta Value: 0.53\n\nHeadquartered in Purchase, Harrison, New York, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stands as a leading American multinational corporation operating in the food, snack, and beverage sector. Renowned for its financial resilience, the beverage giant has maintained a consistent pattern of dividend growth for over 51 years. Presently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, translating to a dividend yield of 2.89% as of March 27.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database of Q4 2023, 64 hedge funds reported holding stakes in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), compared with 65 in the preceding quarter. These stakes have a combined value of nearly $4.55 billion.\n\nAlong with Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a top low-risk investments in April 2024.\n\n7. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67\n\nBeta Value: 0.50\n\nCVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a prominent healthcare entity with an extensive network of retail pharmacies and clinics across the nation.

Renowned for its extensive range of branded consumer packaged goods, the company distributes its products globally across segments that include Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care, and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Presently, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) offers a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share, equating to a yield of 2.32% as of March 27.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q4 2023, 71 hedge funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database reported having stakes in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), compared with 75 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes is roughly $6 billion. With over 10.5 million shares, Fisher Asset Management was the company\u2019s leading stakeholder in Q4.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) joins the ranks of Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) as one of the best low-risk investments in April 2024.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Low-Risk Investments in April 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2024 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks To Buy 11 Best Cruise Stocks To Buy Now\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, PepsiCo (PEP) closed at $169.69, marking a +0.01% move from the previous day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.23%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 1.36%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.4%.\n\nThe food and beverage company's shares have seen an increase of 4.1% over the last month, surpassing the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 3.46% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.61%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of PepsiCo in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on April 23, 2024. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.52, signifying a 1.33% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.16 billion, up 1.74% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $8.15 per share and a revenue of $94.72 billion, indicating changes of +6.96% and +3.55%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed an unchanged state.

        "title": "Analysis-Carrefour-Pepsico dispute sheds light on key role of retailers' ad business",
        "content": "By Helen Reid and Richa Naidu\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Carrefour and PepsiCo's just resolved three-month price dispute has shed light on a new aspect of such negotiations which is changing the relationship between retailers and suppliers.\n\nPepsico said on Thursday the two companies had reached an agreement that will see the food and drink conglomerate's products, which include Pepsi, Doritos chips and Quaker oats, return to Carrefour's shelves in France.\n\nThat agreement has yet to extend to Carrefour stores in Belgium, Italy, Poland and Spain, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe dispute, which started on Jan. 4, was an example of the increasing frictions between consumer goods giants and retailers at a time when they push to sell more advertising makes the two industries more interdependent.\n\nCarrefour and Pepsico, did not disclose the terms of their deal, but their relief was palpable.\n\n\"Delighted that our products are back in Carrefour's aisles,\" PepsiCo France said on X on Thursday, while Carrefour France CEO on Wednesday posted a photo of himself in an aisle of Pepsi bottles with the caption: \"It's great to see friends again that we hadn't seen in a long while.\"\n\nNeither group has given estimates of the three-month-long standoff's impact on their revenues, but when the French retailer pulled Pepsico products off its shelves it was not just risking a hit to its sales.\n\nIt was also irking an important client of its growing business of selling advertising space both in-store and online -referred to jointly as retail media - to consumer goods giants like Pepsico.\n\nThis new business, still in its infancy in Europe compared to the United States, shifts the dynamic in pricing talks as consumer goods firms become both clients suppliers.\n\nWhen retailers pull brands as a negotiation tactic, it hurts their relationship with suppliers and makes brands less willing to spend on their advertising services, said one consumer goods executive, who declined to be named.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat makes advertising budgets an ace up the sleeve of consumer goods giants in price talks, said Laurent Thoumine, Accenture's Europe lead for retail.\n\n\"That's important for most retailers because the net margin you're generating for retail media is much higher than the margin you're generating thanks to your stores,\" he said.\n\nAccording to an eMarketer report from 2023, retail media networks could provide margins of between 40% and 80%, while Alvarez & Marsal forecasts that average retail margins are only 5%.\n\nCarrefour's spat with PepsiCo is one of several recent pricing disputes in Europe.\n\nGerman retailer Edeka is in an ongoing dispute with cereal maker Kellogg over prices, saying the company has refused to supply it since June last year. Edeka also did not sell Mars products for more than 18 months, from mid-2022 until a price dispute was resolved in February this year.\n\nBelgian supermarket chain Colruyt was also at odds with Mars, maker of brands including Maltesers, Orbit chewing gums and Royal Canin pet food, over prices at the start of this year. It also temporarily pulled some AB InBev and Unilever brands from stores late last year before coming to agreements with the companies.\n\nIn pricing talks with suppliers, spending on advertising space on the retailer's website and in stores can be a factor, a Colruyt spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nConsulting firm McKinsey estimates that retail media will generate about $100 billion in advertising spending by companies by 2026.\n\nFor companies, such as Pepsico, Unilever, Nestle, and Danone, retailers' websites and apps offer an ideal space to target specific consumers, while providing valuable shopper data to measure how successful ads are in driving purchases.\n\nIn its annual report, PepsiCo listed the \"increasing power of retailers\" as a key risk to its business. It said retailers have impacted and may continue to impact its ability to compete by demanding lower prices, removing its products, or reducing their shelf space.\n\nPepsico, which according to its annual report generates 15% of its revenue in Europe, said its beverage revenues in France declined at a high-single-digit percentage rate in 2023 while snacks revenues declined at a mid-single-digit rate.\n\nUltimately, such lengthy and high-profile disputes carry risks for both sides. While Carrefour and other retailers portray themselves as fighting for consumers, pulling products is risky as branded foods are a key revenue earner and shoppers can easily find their favourite brands elsewhere.\n\n\"If you're a number one or two retailer you have the power to remove products, but if you're not as big, you need branded products to get traffic into your stores,\" said Moritz Kronenberger, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, a shareholder in retailers and consumer goods companies from Nestle and Pepsico to Carrefour.\n\n(Reporting by Helen Reid and Richa Naidu; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Tomasz Janowski)",

        "title": "Passive Income Perfection: 7 Dividend Stocks to Generate $50,000 Per Year",
        "content": "The topic of passive income is popular these days. Investors, consumers, and many other individuals are curious about any method that can produce income without work. Dividend stocks are an excellent example of one such method. In fact, investors can buy dividend stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nDividend stocks are one of the most reliable sources of passive income available. Investors have been using dividends to create wealth for hundreds of years, in fact several hundred years. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company began paying dividends to its investors. The trend continues today and has been well refined through time tested methods.\n\nLet\u2019s also be realistic here, $50,000 per year in passive income from dividends requires a substantial portfolio. at an average 5% yield an investor will need $1 million in dividend bearing stocks to create $50K in income yearly. Let\u2019s take a look at seven stocks to consider that can get any investor to that goal with enough time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMorgan Stanley (MS) Coins stack of money on saving, the step of the financial stock market, graph and rows of coins, business investment on a green background, Economy stock market growth of financial recovery. Growth stocks\n\nSource: C H A L N / Shutterstock.com\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has transitioned from an investment bank to a firm more oriented toward wealth management in recent times. That transition has made it one of the better dividend stocks to consider for investors seeking passive income.\n\nMy colleague Charles Munyi outlined the bank\u2019s transition toward wealth management in a recent article. Essentially, Morgan Stanley bought up several advisories in the wake of the 2008-2009 crisis. The result is that the company now derives a much greater percentage of revenues from wealth management. This makes it one of those stocks for $50,000 per year income.\n\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s dividend currently yields 3.5% and was last reduced in 2010. It\u2019s also well within the healthy range with a payout ratio of 0.6. The dividend has also grown by nearly 27% over the last 5 years. That\u2019s much higher than the average dividend growth rate of 8 to 10%. Excessive growth can signal risk. In this case the higher rate is probably a representation of the company\u2019s dedication to its shift toward attracting greater wealth management revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nAltria (MO) packs of cigarettes in convenience store rack\n\nSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) is an exceptional dividend stock overall. The company sits among the ranks of the dividend kings. The dividend kings is an elite group of stocks that have not reduced their dividend payment within the last 50 years. It also yields nearly 9% which is quite high.\n\nThus, it provides an exceptional mix of yields and reliability that no other stock can. The reason that Altria is so unique relates to the nature of its industry which is in transition. The company sells tobacco and its fortunes are underpinned by its ownership of Marlboro. With smoking levels continuing to decline Altria is transitioning to smokeless alternatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s e-cigarette brand, NJOY, doesn\u2019t dominate its market. Instead, it sits in third place overall.\n\nThe company\u2019s ability to navigate this transitional period will define the future of its dividend.\n\nMeanwhile, Altria recently bolstered its share repurchase program through the sale of $2.4 billion dollars worth of Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) stock. It all suggests that Altria\u2019s dividend is safe for the midterm at least. For investors seeking $50,000 per year from dividend stocks MO shares are an excellent choice.\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock isn\u2019t far behind Altria in terms of reliability: The firm last reduced its dividend in 1983. That dividend is a prime point of attraction for investors. The energy market is a volatile one as the price of oil can fluctuate drastically from year to year. Exxon Mobil\u2019s dividend provides income and returns that smooth that volatility.\n\nThen in boom years like 2022 the company does exceptionally well providing an excellent opportunity for investors to cash out and profit. Investors learned that they can count on Exxon Mobil to continue paying its dividend through the pandemic and that it does create significant wealth creating opportunities at the same time.\n\nExxon Mobil and other energy giants are particularly attractive at the moment. The electric vehicle sector is in disarray and provides a strong antithesis to a rapid oil-free transition. In other words, ExxonMobil stock continues to be a beacon of reliability despite perceived challenges.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV) A photo of a paper with a chart and the word \"Dividends\" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.\n\nSource: jittawit21/Shutterstock.com\n\nAbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)\u00a0 continues to be an interesting choice among dividend stocks. The company has successfully navigated through the transition of Humira going off patent. Fear related to that had long plagued the company but it looks like it has mostly survived unscathed.\n\nThe company has successfully introduced other drugs to combat declining revenues. The result is that while revenues are slightly down in 2023 overall, most analysts believe the company has done well.\n\nSimply put, AbbVie wouldn\u2019t be able to continue paying its dividend if the company didn\u2019t manage that transition. Analysts from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) believe that ABBV shares are worth $200. Those analysts believe that earnings will improve as revenues from drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq replace those from Humira.\n\nEarnings is one of the primary areas to focus on for ABBV investors. The stock\u2019s P/E ratio isn\u2019t strong at the moment. However, the company\u2019s diverse portfolio has shown massive turnaround potential of late and those earnings could quickly reverse. That\u2019s essentially what Wells Fargo is saying in attaching a $200 target price to ABBV at present. The company will continue to pay dividends as it has since 1972. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how everything pans out but it looks like AbbVie will emerge stronger.\n\nPepsi (PEP) stock market ticker screen with the word \"dividends\" appearing in large text. Must-Have Dividend Stocks. Dividend kings to own\n\nSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.com\n\nPepsi (NYSE:PEP) is another dividend king, making it a very reliable stock overall. It\u2019s a nice addition to any portfolio for investors seeking to generate $50,000 in dividend income annually.\n\nOne of the most important things to consider when discussing Pepsi is its recent performance in light of inflation. The company has fared very well over the last few years as inflation has become endemic. What\u2019s important to note here is that Pepsi doesn\u2019t only sell beverages, it also has a large portfolio of snack foods. Its beverages and snack foods have become much more expensive. However, consumer\u00a0 demand remains steadfast. In fact, organic revenues increased by nearly 10% in 2023. That suggests Pepsi will now be able to charge those higher prices moving forward.\n\nConsumers shouldn\u2019t expect those prices to\u00a0 revert to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, they should expect a stabilization of prices. That means Pepsi will be able to depend on higher sales you forward and continue to pay a reliable dividend. In fact, Pepsi announced that it will increase its annual dividend by 7% beginning in June.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) is a stock that represents an intriguing mix of growth and income that should continue to attract investors.\n\nShare prices have appreciated dramatically over the past year. The legacy technology company has essentially positioned itself well in relation to AI. Strong investments have resulted in a book of business that doubled sequentially for AI workloads between the third and fourth quarter. That news served to reaffirm the recent increase in prices which is predicated on its AI potential.\n\nAnyway, That\u2019s The Story of IBM as it relates to growth. The company is well positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence and other trends like quantum computing.Those opportunities may very well allow the company to shed its image as a legacy firm.\n\nThat\u2019s compelling in and of itself but then add in its dividend and IBM becomes even more attractive. The company is reliable for income investors: It last reduced its dividend in 1994. It all adds up to create a company that represents a unique opportunity for investors looking to build $50k annually in passive income.\n\nPhilip Morris (PM) An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.\n\nSource: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.com\n\nPhilip Morris (NYSE:PM) is one of many legacy cigarette companies that continues to offer a lot to investors at the moment. The stock provides a dividend yielding more than 5.5% and is relatively stable having last been reduced in 2008.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially the same story for Philip Morris as for all other cigarette stocks: these firms are navigating a transition to lower arm tobacco products while relying on cigarettes to underpin their businesses.\n\nIn the case of Philip Morris, that also means taking some risks. The company has to find new sources of revenue to make up for declining smoking rates. The company is buying assets at a rate well in excess of revenue growth. That suggests inefficiency.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s an inefficiency born of necessity. Philip Morris has to find new growth. As it searches for that growth investors should simply take advantage of its dividend. It\u2019s the same story that investors will find in relation to Altria, discussed above.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Consumer Staples Stocks Short Sellers Are Targeting: Danger in the Aisles?",
        "content": "In 2023, consumer staples stocks were down a collective 6.5%, vastly underperforming the broader market. That has made investors bullish about the sector in 2024. As the story typically goes, a sector that underperforms one year often outperforms the next year. However, short interest creates a plot twist that may keep this sector down. At least, that seems to be the case for some consumer staples stocks that short sellers are targeting.\n\nStorytellers frequently use foreshadowing to hint at future developments in the story. Similarly, investors frequently receive clues about what direction a stock may move. One of those is short interest. This refers to the percentage of a stock\u2019s float (the number of shares available to the public) that are being sold short.\n\nShares sold short are borrowed and sold as investors hope the share price will drop before the borrowed shares are returned. Therefore, stocks with high short interest may be more likely to move lower in the near future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBefore we look at the three consumer staples stocks that short sellers target, it\u2019s important to remember that high short interest doesn\u2019t mean stocks will go down. However, it does mean that institutional investors see something in the stock causing them to be cautious.\n\nHershey\u2019s (HSY) Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden table\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/VG Foto\n\nHershey\u2019s (NYSE:HSY) stock is down about 21% in the last 12 months. The culprit is rising cocoa prices that are eating into earnings. And this is despite the company\u2019s mostly successful efforts to pass costs along to the consumer.\u00a0In the company\u2019s February earnings report, the company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were flat year-over-year. The chocolate maker is also forecasting flat earnings for 2024.\n\nShort interest in HSY stock is up 31% in the last month as investors expect the impact of cocoa prices to show up in the company\u2019s upcoming earnings. This continues a pattern of institutional investors aggressively selling the stock in the last two quarters. Analysts also give Hershey\u2019s stock a consensus Hold rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, HSY stock is up more than 6% in 2024, pushing against a resistance level of around $200. However, earnings are not likely to provide a boost, and with an early Easter, there\u2019s no major event to drive sales in what is historically the company\u2019s weakest quarter in terms of revenue.\n\nBeyond Meat (BYND) Editorial photo on Beyond Meat (BYND) theme. Illustrative photo for news about Beyond Meat - a producer of plant-based meat substitutes. BYND stock\n\nSource: photo_gonzo / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) is one of the consumer staples stocks that short sellers are targeting. The company\u2019s full-year revenue of $343 million was 18% lower than in 2022. And the earnings picture isn\u2019t any better.\n\nThe company is pledging to undertake cost-cutting measures to improve the outlook on earnings. But cost-cutting only goes so far. Beyond Meat went public in 2019 on a mission to change how people thought about plant-based protein. They\u2019ve succeeded in some ways, but the company faces increased competition from other plant-based products.\n\nThere was hope that the inflated price of beef would have made the price of Beyond Meat\u2019s products more appetizing. But that hasn\u2019t been the case either. And without more demand, it\u2019s hard to make a bullish case for future growth.\n\nThe short interest in BYND stock has been down about 3.4% in the last month. However, there\u2019s still about 36% short interest in the stock. That should concern investors.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has been under pressure for the last 12 months as the rise of obesity drugs has made investors skittish about the company\u2019s future earnings. PepsiCo beat on the bottom lines in every quarter in 2024. However, a slight miss on the top line in the most recent quarter was all it took to lower PEP stock.\n\nThe good news is that the stock looks like it\u2019s found a floor, but the ceiling may be harder to define. Pepsi is guiding to single-digit growth in organic revenue and earnings in 2024. But that hasn\u2019t stopped short sellers from betting against the company. Short interest is up 6% in the last month. And while the overall percentage of the stock float is low, it\u2019s still weighing on the stock.\n\nOf the three stocks on this list, PEP stock looks like the best buy if for no other reason than the company\u2019s dividend. Pepsi is a dividend king that has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at\u00a0the 11 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nAmid eye-popping growth of technology stocks, dividend investing has taken a backseat over the past few months. But this phenomenon is not a new one. Data shows that since the end of 2008, US stocks with dividend yields over 5% returned about 450%, compared to a 1200% return posted by non-dividend companies. However, many analysts believe this is about to change since the era of easy money where interest rates were almost zero is nearing its end. A Wall Street Journal report recently highlighted some trends in dividend investing shared by Daniel Peris in his book \u201cThe Ownership Dividend - The Coming Paradigm Shift in the U.S. Stock Market.\u201d Peris argues that the pendulum might shift in favor of dividend stocks since the forces behind the almost 40-year period of low interest rates and buybacks seem to have exhausted and the market could return to the typical structure in which dividends had a lot of importance.\n\nThere was a time when investing in a company automatically meant you\u2019d get dividends from it since markets were not fixated around short-term share price movements. As Benjamin Graham once said:\n\n\"The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends regularly and, presumably, to increase the rate as time goes on.\"\n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1950s, dividends accounted for about 80% of the total market returns, according to the WSJ report which cited economist Robert\u00a0J.\u00a0Shiller, Sterling Professor of\u00a0Economics at Yale. This contribution to returns by dividends declined to 30% over the past decade. But could the tide really turn in the favor of dividends? Early signs are here. Meta Platforms surprised investors earlier this year when it announced a $0.50 a share dividend. Analysts believe as investor appetite for steady income and low volatility increases and markets begin to digest the possibility of the higher for longer scenario, dividend-paying stocks would see a renewed interest.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first scanned through the list of dividend aristocrats \u2014 a group of S&P 500 stocks that have increased their dividends every year for at least 25 years. From this list we chose 11 companies with at least 50 years of consistent dividend increases and positive hedge fund sentiment. We preferred stocks with relatively low payout ratios (under 50%), wider moats and positive analyst ratings. The idea was to prefer dividend growth companies that are offering safe dividends and are deemed investment worthy by smart money managers. But why is it important to pay attention to hedge fund sentiment? Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever\n\nPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/\n\n11. Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nNucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) is one of the biggest steel companies in America, with about 50 years of consistent dividend increases. With a solid position in a market which is difficult to enter for new players and a payout ratio of just 12%, Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) is one of the safest dividend stocks.\n\nA total of 40 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The biggest stake in Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) is owned by Citadel Investment Group of Ken Griffin which owns a $178 million stake in Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE).\n\n10. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 54\n\nWith over 62 years of consistent dividend increases, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) ranks 10th in our list of the magnificent dividend growth stocks to buy and hold forever. Earlier this month, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) increased its quarterly dividend by 4.2%. The new dividend is payable May 15 to shareholders of record as of April 22.\n\nInsider Monkey\u2019s database of 943 hedge funds shows that 54 hedge funds had stakes in Colgate-Palmolive Company\u00a0(NYSE:CL)\u00a0as of the end of 2023.\n\n9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 58\n\nTarget Corp (NYSE:TGT) has increased its dividends consistently over the past 55 years. The stock jumped last month following Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) earnings and its investor event where Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) announced strong guidance and a new subscription tier. Deutsche Bank recently upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, citing improvement in traffic trends and margins expansion. HSBC also increased Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) rating to Buy from Hold.\n\nOut of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database, 58 hedge funds reported having stakes in Target Corp\u00a0(NYSE:TGT) as of the end of the last quarter of 2023.\n\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\nOther top contributors in Q4 included Allstate, American International Group (AIG) and\u00a0Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). US-based mass retailer Target is capitalizing on cleaner inventory, lower freight costs and improved efficiency to improve profitability \u2014 and investors rewarded shares accordingly in Q4.\n\n8. Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 60\n\nMedical device company Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) is one of the magnificent dividend growth stocks to buy and hold forever. Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) has increased its dividend for 52 years without a break. In February it announced fiscal Q1 results according to which its adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $2.68, beating estimates by $0.28. Becton Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX) also increased its full-year EPS guidance and midpoint of organic revenue growth guidance.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 60 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey had stakes in Becton Dickinson and Co\u00a0(NYSE:BDX).\n\nAristotle Atlantic Core Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cBecton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX) detracted from portfolio performance in the quarter, as the company announced lower-than-expected guidance for fiscal year 2024. The weaker guidance was mainly driven by adverse moves in foreign exchange markets; however, the guidance seemed to surprise investors, even though we believe the underlying business trends remain solid.\u201d\n\n7. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 62\n\nCoca-Cola Co\u00a0(NYSE:KO)\u00a0is one of the all-time favorite dividend stocks of several billionaires and money managers, the most prominent of whom are Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett, who had a $24 billion stake in Coca-Cola Co\u00a0(NYSE:KO). Buffett has been holding a stake in the beverage giant, which has increased its dividend consistently for the past 62 years, since the last quarter of 2010. In February Coca-Cola Co\u00a0(NYSE:KO)\u00a0increased its dividend by 5.4%.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US,\u00a0The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, heathier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n6. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 64\n\nPepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) is a dividend king with 52 consecutive years of dividend increases. Wells Fargo analyst John Sheehan recently published a list of dividend stocks which the analyst believes have stood the test of time. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) made it to the list.\n\n\u201cOur process considers long-term growth, the management team\u2019s level of experience, return on invested capital, stability of revenues and earnings, stock price volatility, financial strength, debt ratings (if applicable), and any other characteristics that we deem significant, either overall or for a specific industry or sector, as well as the potential to maintain these characteristics,\u201d Sheehan wrote.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Core Equity Strategy stated the following regarding PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe sold\u00a0PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) based on our belief that the inflation and interest rate cycle has peaked, and the company may have difficulty maintaining the recent organic growth trends which were driven mainly by price increases. Furthermore, the market appears to be shifting away from defensive names and into a more cyclical positioning which could cause PepsiCo to lag.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see5 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nForget Magnificent Seven: Jim Cramer Likes These \u2018Super 7\u2019 European Stocks 16 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds Jim Cramer Says You Should Avoid These 11 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss top 12 dividend stocks to buy now according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Stocks To Buy Now According To Analysts.\n\nAfter having a bad year in 2023, dividend stocks are coming back into fashion this year. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by 6.1% this year so far, with its 12-month gains coming in at 11.2%.\n\nFor dividend investors, the underperformance of dividend stocks in the short term is not really a matter of concern. Contrary to popular belief, investors tend to stick with their dividend investments even when these equities lag. When the market\u2019s focus was on the tech rally last year, investors held on to their dividend investments. This sentiment was also affirmed by David Harrell, who serves as the editor of Morningstar DividendInvestor. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\u201cAnd when you have a more growth-oriented environment as we\u2019ve had recently, certainly in 2023, dividend stocks are going to lag. But at the same time, dividend investors aren\u2019t necessarily focusing on this horse race on a monthly or an annual basis like, well, are dividend stocks lagging the broad market or outperforming the broad market? Most of those investors, I believe, are focused on getting that yield from the portfolio. So, they\u2019re getting the yield and generally hopefully getting some capital appreciation as well. So, as long as those yields are remaining strong for their portfolios, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a concern.\u201d\n\nThis optimistic outlook from analysts comes from the previous performance of dividend stocks. Over the years, dividend stocks have outperformed their non-dividend counterparts, particularly in certain market conditions. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we referred to data from Hartford Funds, highlighting the returns of dividend stocks relative to non-dividend stocks. The report revealed that from 1973 to 2023, dividend-paying companies delivered an annual average return of 9.17%, compared with 4.27% gains of companies that do not pay dividends. The report also mentioned that during this period, the companies that maintained their dividend payments also surpassed non-dividend companies, delivering a 6.74% return. This shows that dividend income has been an important aspect of overall returns in the past.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend investing primarily focuses on seeking out stocks with high yields and strong dividend growth streaks. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the strong dividend growers in the market, having raised their payouts for decades. Companies that keep on increasing their payouts have shown stellar performance in the past, especially during market downturns. From May 2005 to December 2023, the Dividend Aristocrat Index returned 11.5% in periods of high interest rates, outperforming high dividend yield stocks, which gained 10.46%.\n\nIn view of these arguments, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss top 10 dividend aristocrats according to dividend yields. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their previous performance, and go directly to read Top 5 Dividend Aristocrats by Yield: April 2024.\n\nDividend Aristocrats are special. Out of roughly 6,000 stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, only 67 companies have the privilege of being called dividend aristocrats. They are a select group of companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. These stocks belong to the S&P 500 and are represented through the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index. Due to their consistent dividend growth over the years, which mainly reflects their strong financial position, dividend aristocrats are highly favored by investors. In addition to this, these stocks have shown strong performance over the years, surpassing other asset classes. Since the index\u2019s inception in 2005 through September 2023, the dividend aristocrats index delivered a total return of 10.35%, outperforming the broader market, which delivered a 9.54% return during this period.\n\nWhile dividend aristocrats are mainly known for their dividend growth and stable equity gains, it is important to acknowledge that they showed lower volatility levels in achieving these returns. In one of our articles on the subject, we reported that from 2005 to September 2023, dividend aristocrats showed low volatility levels of 15.35%, compared with a slightly higher volatility rate of 16.31% for the S&P 500. This shows that these stocks do not experience regular fluctuations in their price movements and are comparatively resilient. By consistently raising their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, these companies have shown the ability to reward shareholders with growing dividends during challenging periods, such as the financial crisis of 2007 and the pandemic of 2020.\n\nFrom December 1989 to July 2023, the dividend aristocrats index performed better than the broader market 69.34% of the time during down markets, and 43.61% of the time when the market was up. This is to be noted that the dividend aristocrats index was launched in 2005 and all the data prior to that is back-tested hypothetical research. In addition to their performance in both bullish and bearish markets, dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 52.3% of the time during this timeframe.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough investors tend to focus on only one aspect of dividend investing, be it dividend growth or dividend yield, research has shown that both these strategies can coexist. Dividend growth stocks with stable yields can offer reliable investment opportunities, where investors can benefit from regular income and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks popular among investors. However, in this article, we will focus on the highest yielding dividend aristocrats.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe S&P 500 is consistently recording gains this year, having risen for four months in a row. According to Bank of America\u2019s chief global strategist Michael Hartnett, the remarkable returns achieved by the S&P 500 over a short time period have been rare and only occurred ten times since the 1930s. He further said that these returns materialized either during the aftermath of the recession, like the ones in 2009 and 2020, or at the onset of a bubble, similar to the situation experienced in 1999. That said, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which played a significant role in driving the market rally in 2023, has entered the oversold territory this year. The stock is down by 7.63% year-to-date, facing pressures due to concerns over iPhone sales in China and a fine from the European Union, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors are trying to navigate this directionless market, seeking to maximize their returns by making informed decisions. Over the years, dividend stocks have served as a safeguard against market downturns, making them an appealing option in the current environment. When considering investments in dividend stocks, combining dividend yields with dividend growth can be a good strategy. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which analyzed the performance of the S&P 500 High Yield Dividend Aristocrats. The index tracks the performance of high-yield dividend companies within the S&P 500 Composite 1500 with at least 20 consecutive years of dividend growth. The report revealed that between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the index outperformed its benchmark index by 140 basis points per month. During this period, the index also surpassed the S&P 500 High Dividend Index by 49 basis points per month.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur research also showed that dividend stocks have performed better than other asset classes during inflationary periods. We cited data from Hartford Funds, examining the performance of dividend stocks during decades of the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s when inflation in the US was at its peak. The report highlighted that during these decades the average market returns were below 10%, and dividends contributed 67%, 44%, and 73% to the market\u2019s returns, respectively. One of the main reasons for this performance of dividend stocks can be attributed to the fact that they have the potential to grow over time. The companies that generate more profit may opt to increase their dividends, remaining more committed to their shareholder obligation. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks in this regard, returning their capital to shareholders consistently for years.\n\nThat said, dividend stocks\u2019 past performance does not guarantee immunity against severe market conditions. During market clampdowns, investors' confidence may decline which triggers widespread selling across various stocks resulting in some becoming oversold. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), introduced by J. Welles Wilder Jr. in 1978, is a technical analysis tool that is used to analyze the speed and change of price movements of a stock. The RSI is calculated based on the average gains and losses over a specific period, typically 14 trading days. However, this period can be adjusted depending on the trader's preference. In this article, we have compiled a list of oversold stocks based on 14-day RSI levels as of March 30. 12 Oversold Dividend Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and looked for dividend stocks with a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 40 as of March 30. An RSI below 40 suggests that the stock is oversold. The stocks are ranked in descending order of their RSI. We also mentioned hedge fund sentiment data for these stocks using Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds as of Q4 2023.

        "content": "Whether you have $400 to invest or $400,000, you'd be smart to consider plunking those dollars in some healthy and growing dividend-paying stocks. Why dividend payers? Well, they can appreciate in value just like other good stocks, but while doing so, they'll kick out cash to you regularly -- cash that can be used to support you in retirement or to buy additional shares of stock. And on top of that, healthy and growing dividend payers typically increase their payouts over time, too.\n\nHere's the kicker: Dividend payers tend to perform better than non-payers, too! Check out the table below, adapted from a Hartford Funds report:\n\nDividend-Paying Status Average Annual Total Return, 1973-2022 Dividend growers and initiators 10.24% Dividend payers 9.18% No change in dividend policy 6.60% Dividend non-payers (0.60%) Dividend shrinkers and eliminators 3.95%\n\nData source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.\n\nHere, then, are three dividend-paying stocks to consider for your portfolio. All three have recently sporting attractive valuations as well as attractive dividends.\n\n1. Medtronic\n\nMedtronic(NYSE: MDT) is a healthcare giant with a recent market value of $111 billion. It offers medical devices such as implantable pacemakers, aortic valves, mesh implants, stapling devices, and technology used in robot-assisted surgeries -- among many other things. The company employs close to 100,000 people in 150 countries, and its offerings treat more than 70 health conditions, such as diabetes.\n\nMedtronic's dividend recently sported a dividend yield of 3.3%, and that payout has increased at an average annual rate of 7% over the past five years (and it has upped its payout for 46 consecutive years now). Its business is growing, too, with third-quarter revenue increasing by 4.7% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) advancing by 8%. Medtronic is likely to keep growing, because it invests heavily in developing new treatments and products. It spent $2.7 billion on research and development in its fiscal year 2023, and recently had more than 200 active clinical trials in progress.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, the company is shedding less-profitable operations, such as its line of ventilators. Its stock looks attractively priced at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.6, well below its five-year average of 18.1.\n\n2. Starbucks\n\nStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) needs little introduction, as it boasts more than 38,000 locations in more than 80 markets around the globe -- and it also has products on the shelves of many retailers, too. Starbucks' dividend recently yielded 2.5%. That payout has grown by an average annual rate of 10% over the past five years -- and it's likely that another increase will be announced this fall.\n\nA solid and growing dividend is great, but you also should want the underlying company to be growing at a decent clip. In its first quarter, Starbucks' net revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion, with sales at stores open more than a year increasing by 5% globally. Earnings per share surged 22%. One particularly successful Starbucks initiative has been its rewards program, with membership growing 13% year over year in the first quarter, to 34.3 million.\n\nEverything isn't 100% rosy at the company -- overall inflation has many consumers cutting back on their spending, and Starbucks' growth rate is slower than in years past, in part because of competition. But it has still boosted its operating margin and has multiple irons in the growth fire -- such as offering delivery and drive-thru services. There's a lot to like about Starbucks' prospects -- and its stock seems undervalued, too, with its recent forward P/E of 22.3 well below the five-year average of 28.4.\n\n3. PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) is another familiar name, a $237-billion titan in both the soft-drink and salty-snack realms, with brands such as Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker, and SodaStream. PepsiCo's dividend recently yielded 2.9%, and it has been upped by an annual average of 6% over the past five years. It, too, has a long dividend history, with its last increase of 7% being its 52nd consecutive annual increase.\n\nPepsiCo's net revenue in its fourth quarter was down less than 1% year over year, but its full-year revenue for 2023 was up 5.9%, with full-year EPS rising 2%. Pepsico's stock valuation looks appealing, too, with its forward P/E of 20.0 well below the five-year average of 23.5.\n\nThese are just three of many attractive dividend payers out there. Remember, too, that if you aren't comfortable picking stocks on your own, you can always opt for one or more dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- and you can do so with just $400 or with much more.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Medtronic wasn\u2019t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Beaten Down Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nIn 2023, investors piled into tech stocks as the sector benefitted from favorable macroeconomic conditions and the rise of generative artificial intelligence. Investors\u2019 inclination toward tech stocks left dividend equities in the dust, despite being the winners in 2022. The tech-heavy NASDAQ finished 2023 with 43% gains, compared with a 5.74% return of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. However, due to consistent market volatility in recent years, investors are continually gravitating back to dividend-paying stocks, even after being distracted by the attractiveness of other asset classes temporarily. This becomes evident after analyzing the gradual increase in the amount of dividends paid by the S&P 500 over the years.\n\nCNBC referred to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and highlighted that S&P 500 companies paid $483 billion in dividends in 2020, down slightly from $485 billion in 2019. This is understandable as the year 2020 was marked by the widespread ramifications of the pandemic, causing nearly every industry and business to suffer. That said, there has been a constant uptick in dividend payments since then. After recovering from the ill effects of the pandemic, the US companies distributed $522 billion in dividends in 2021, which grew to over $564 billion in 2022, showing a significant increase of 8.1%. Finally, the figure reached a new record of $588.2 billion last year.\n\nThe constant increase in dividend payments over the years has restored investors\u2019 confidence in their dividend investments. In addition to this, historical analysis has shown how dividend stocks have offered a buffer against certain market fluctuations due to their capacity to generate regular income. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, spoke about the importance of dividend stocks during market downturns in his interview with CNBC earlier this year. He said:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWhen stock prices fall, it\u2019s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you\u2019re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don\u2019t care so much about the market\u2019s short-term ups and downs anymore.\u201d\n\nDespite being the underdogs in the stock market last year, analysts and seasoned investors have retained their interest in dividend stocks. Janus Henderson predicts the total dividend payments for 2024 will reach $1.72 trillion, showing a nearly 4% growth on a headline basis from last year, which translates to underlying growth of 5%. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, commented on dividend growth in 2024. Here is what he said:\n\n\u201cFor 2024, the dollar aggregate of dividends is expected to increase once again. Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, the index is also expected to log its 13th consecutive record year, with a 4.5% - 5% increase in payments for 2024, compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and its 10.8% increase in 2022.\u201d\n\nThough some of the best dividend stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) delivered positive returns so far this year so far, many dividend stocks have shown negative returns in comparison. However, these stocks have strong fundamentals that may lead to potential recovery in the near future. In this article, we will take a look at the beaten down dividend stocks to invest in. 11 Best Beaten Down Dividend Stocks to Invest in Now\n\nDaily newspaper economy stock market chart\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we used a stock screening tool to identify dividend stocks that reached their 52-week lows around March 29.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 25 things every dividend investor should know. If you want to read further about dividend investing, go directly to have a look at 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\n\nInvestors tend to gravitate towards investments that provide them with income, and dividend stocks are particularly popular in this regard. These stocks stand out for their ability to generate consistent income streams. Dividends represent a share of a company's profits that are allocated to its shareholders either as cash payments or in the form of additional shares of stock. Investing in dividends may appear simple at first glance, as it involves investors anticipating regular payments on a quarterly, monthly, or yearly basis. However, this investment strategy involves a multitude of considerations when selecting suitable stocks. Key factors include the growth rate of dividends, the compounding impact of reinvesting dividends, payout ratios, cash flow analysis, and dividend yields. Understanding these elements is essential for making informed decisions when venturing into dividend stock investments.\n\nOne of the key factors that greatly attracts investors is the consistent increase in dividends over time. Stocks that consistently raise their dividends have historically demonstrated superior performance, delivering enhanced returns to shareholders. These types of stocks become particularly valuable during periods of financial instability or economic downturns when investors seek reliable income streams. Examples of top dividend stocks renowned for their sustained dividend growth include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). These companies have consistently rewarded shareholders with growing dividends over the years.\n\nInvesting in dividends offers multiple avenues for investors to explore, and when executed effectively, it has the potential to create substantial wealth for individuals. For this reason, we have compiled a list of 25 things every dividend investor should know.\n\nStory continues 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know\n\nPhoto by Marga Santoso on Unsplash\n\n25. Dividends have Contributed Significantly to Total Market Returns:\n\nOver an extended period, dividend-paying stocks have played a substantial role in driving the overall returns of the market. A study conducted by Hartford Funds revealed that between 1940 and 2023, dividends accounted for an average of 34% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index. Additionally, during decades such as the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, where total returns were below 10%, dividends made a significant contribution to the overall returns. Another study conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices highlighted the impact of dividend-paying stocks on overall investment returns throughout the 2000s. According to the report, dividend income accounted for approximately 68% of the total returns during that decade.\n\n24. Dividend Stocks Have Outperformed Non-Dividend Stocks Over the Long-Term:\n\nStocks that do not pay dividends have consistently underperformed dividend-paying stocks over time, particularly in certain market situations. For instance, during market downturns such as the one witnessed in 2022, where the S&P 500 Index dropped by over 18%, dividend-paying assets demonstrated their capacity to shield investors from significant losses. In 2022, stocks listed in the S&P 500 that distributed dividends experienced a decline of 11.1%, while those that did not pay dividends suffered a much steeper loss of 38.7%.\n\nAnalyzing the performance over the long term reveals the robust returns delivered by dividend-paying companies. Research from Hartford Funds indicated that from 1973 to 2023, companies distributing dividends achieved an average annual return of 9.17%. In contrast, non-dividend-paying companies yielded a significantly lower average return of 4.27% over the same period. Furthermore, companies that maintained consistent dividend policies throughout this timeframe returned an average of 6.74%.\n\n23. Dividend Stocks Can Provide a Hedge Against Inflation:\n\nDuring market downturns, investors often grapple with concerns about their investments, particularly exacerbated by the impact of inflation. Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated resilience during inflationary periods compared to other asset classes. According to a report by Hartford Funds, between 1970 and 2022, there were eight such inflationary periods, during which dividend-paying companies consistently outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts. The report highlighted the 1970s as one of the most notorious periods of American inflation, driven by surging oil prices. Despite market challenges, dividends played a pivotal role, accounting for a significant portion of returns, with as much as 73% of the S&P 500's returns attributed to dividends during this time.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this outperformance of dividend stocks is their tendency to generate substantial free cash flow. Unlike growth-focused companies that prioritize reinvestment for expansion, dividend-paying companies have established revenue streams and financial stability, making them more resilient in slowing growth or recessionary environments. Their ability to maintain consistent dividend payments reflects their sound financial health and adaptability during adverse market conditions.\n\n22. Dividend Stocks Have Outpaced Inflation Over the Years:\n\nOver time, inflation gradually diminishes the purchasing power of currency, posing challenges for income investors. However, dividends offer a notable advantage during periods of high inflation due to their potential for growth compared to fixed bond coupons. Research from BlackRock underscored this, revealing that over the past 150 years, dividends from U.S. companies have experienced an average annual growth rate of 3.7%, outpacing the average annual inflation rate of 2%.\n\nWisdom Tree conducted research confirming that dividends have consistently surpassed inflation rates. Their findings indicate that between 1957 and 2022, dividends experienced an average annual growth of 5.7%, exceeding the inflation rate by more than 2%. Similarly, from 1990 to 2022, dividends from the S&P 500 grew by 5.61%, while inflation only saw a growth of 2.64% during the same period. This highlights the ability of dividends to provide investors with a hedge against inflation and potentially enhance their purchasing power over time.\n\n21. Dividend Stocks are Less Volatile than Non-dividend Stocks:\n\nThe regular dividend payments paid to investors act as a buffer during market downturns, providing stability to the stock\u2019s price. In addition to this, companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders have stable cash flows and established business models, which can lower the volatility. Wisdom Tree reported that stock prices are over two times more volatile than dividend stocks. The firm gathered data from the last 64 years and highlighted that there were only six instances during this period where dividends decreased, and only one of those cases saw a decline of over 5%. In comparison, stock prices experienced declines in 18 of those years, with the most severe yearly decline surpassing 40%. The report also mentioned that on average, stocks fell by more than 11% annually during that period.\n\nCompanies that regularly grow their dividends are particularly less volatile than other asset classes. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, when the market experienced declines between December 31, 1999, and March 31, 2022, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats showed better performance compared to both the S&P Composite 1500 and the S&P 500 High Dividend Index, outpacing by 140 basis points per month and by 49 basis points per month, respectively.\n\n20. The Payout Ratio is an Important Metric to Consider in Dividend Investing:\n\nThe payout ratio is one of the most useful important metrics for evaluating dividend-paying companies. This mainly analyses how much of a company\u2019s income is being distributed among its shareholders in the form of dividends. A high payout ratio is not considered healthy, as it shows that a company is paying more than it can afford. On the other hand, a low ratio indicates that a company is maintaining more earnings for reinvestments and to fulfill shareholder obligations. According to analysts, the dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 55% is considered healthy as it shows that the company has enough money left over to reinvest for growth.\n\nThe Wellington Management did a detailed study on that and categorized dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 into quintiles based on their dividend yields and payout ratios. The highest dividend-paying stocks, representing the top 20%, comprised the first quintile, while the lowest and non-payers constituted the fifth quintile. Over nine decades, from 1930 to 2019, the study examined the performance of each quintile. Results showed that second-quintile stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in seven out of nine periods, accounting for 77.8% of the time. The first and third quintiles tied for second place, outperforming the index in six out of nine periods. However, fourth and fifth-quintile stocks performed less favorably, outperforming the index in only four instances each. One explanation for the outperformance of second-quintile dividend stocks compared to the first quintile is their lower average dividend payout ratio. The first-quintile payout ratio averaged slightly above 70%, while the second-quintile payout ratio averaged just over 40%.\n\n19. High-Yield Dividend Stocks Can be More Volatile:\n\nInvestors often consider high dividend yield as an advantageous feature when investing in dividend stocks. However, high yields are not always practical as this could be a sign that the stock price has fallen significantly, which could be a sign of an underlying issue within the company. In addition to this, high-dividend stocks can be more volatile because they are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and market conditions. The Wellington Management study discovered that stocks with the highest levels of dividend payouts and yields have shown strong performance over time. However, they didn't perform as well as stocks that pay high, though not the absolute highest, levels of dividend payouts and yields.\n\nAccording to analysts, a dividend yield between 3% and 5% is generally considered healthy as this range creates a balance between being neither excessively high nor too low. According to a report by Nuveen, global dividend-paying companies with a more moderate yield (0-3%) typically exhibit stronger potential for earnings growth, more robust profitability metrics, and higher profit margins in comparison to high dividend-yielding companies (those with yields above 3%) and companies that do not pay dividends at all. These factors often contribute to reducing risk, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility.\n\nHigh dividend yields, when combined with a track record of consistent dividend growth record, can offer great investment opportunities for investors. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. (NYSE:TDS), and British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI) are some of the best stocks in this regard as these companies have consistently raised their payouts for years and also boast above-average dividend yields.\n\n18. An Elite Group of Dividend Aristocrats:\n\nAs mentioned above, dividend growers take the lead among investors when it comes to investing in dividend stocks. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index seeks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some examples of dividend aristocrat stocks that are popular among investors. Their ability to raise dividends consistently stems from their strong balance sheets and stable cash generation. Due to these qualities, these stocks have performed better than others over the course of history. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrat index has shown a notable capacity to protect against downturns, as evidenced by their upside and downside capture ratios. The report highlighted that these stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 around 69.34% of the time during down months and approximately 43.6% of the time during up months. Dividend aristocrats also delivered an average excess return of 1.05% in down months over the broader market index. In addition to this, the index experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the S&P 500.\n\nThe outperformance of dividend aristocrats also brings in the factor of high dividend yields, highlighting the advantage that dividend growers hold over those with simply high yields. ProShares reported that dividend growth has consistently demonstrated strong performance regardless of the direction of the interest rates. According to the report, from May 2005 to December 2023, the Dividend Aristocrats index delivered an 11.55% return in rising interest rate periods, compared with a 10.46% return of high-yield dividend stocks, represented by the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index. Similarly, in falling interest rate periods, dividend aristocrats returned 12.50%, surpassing a 7.90% return of high dividend stocks. Overall during this period, dividend growers yielded a 12% return, outperforming high-yield stocks, which delivered a 9.27% return.\n\n17. Dividend Growth Rate is Crucial to Dividend Investing:\n\nThe importance of dividend growth cannot be emphasized enough as it reflects the company\u2019s financial health and strength. The consistency in growing dividends shows that the company is generating sustainable earnings and has confidence in its future payouts. Abrdn reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68% from December 2002 to December 2022, significantly outperforming dividend cutters and eliminators, which returned 2.70% during this period. Non-dividend payers were also behind companies with regular dividend growth, returning 9.25% within this timeframe.\n\n16. Dividend Growers Usually Have Strong Cash Flow:\n\nDividend growth and strong cash flow go hand in hand because this serves as a testament to the company\u2019s financial health and stability. These companies generate reliable and consistent earnings from their main operations, which provides a solid foundation for maintaining and growing dividend payments over time. In addition to this, these companies can smoothly invest in growth initiatives, research and development, and other strategic opportunities with the ample cash that they generate.\n\nFollowing in the trend, analysts are positive about dividend growth in the future as the cash on the corporate balance sheets has increased significantly over the years. According to a report by Global Market Intelligence, 13 non-financial S&P 500 companies collectively hold cash and investments of over $1 trillion, as of September 2023. These include some of the strongest dividend companies, such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM),\u00a0 and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).\n\n15. Dividend Capture Strategies:\n\nThe data we have mentioned in this article so far highlights the importance of dividend stocks in the long run. However, some investors also exploit dividend equities for short-term gains through a strategy called dividend capture strategy. The goal of this approach is to secure the dividend payment while minimizing exposure to the stock's price movements. The ex-dividend date is the day on which a stock begins trading without the dividend payment included in its price. Investors who own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend payment.\n\n14. Dividend Stocks Can Be Found Across a Variety of Sectors and Industries:\n\nDividend stocks are found across a variety of industries and sectors, including technology, healthcare, consumer goods, finance, utilities, and more. Certain sectors pay higher dividends compared to others and have varying dividend yields. Real estate and utilities sectors exhibit the highest dividend yields, averaging around 4%. On the other hand, though the tech sector merged as the winner in 2023, it tends to offer lower yields, averaging below 1%. As of 2023, the energy sector has taken the spotlight for raising its dividends and launching debt reduction programs, replacing both utilities and real estate. Both these sectors have announced various dividend cuts throughout the year, mainly due to fluctuating interest rates. That said, these three sectors still make up the best investment options for income investors as there are a lot of undervalued opportunities within them, according to Morningstar chief US market strategist David Sekera.\n\n13. Dividend-Focused Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Are a Good Way to Build Diversified Portfolios:\n\nWhat could be better than owning one dividend stock? Investing in a basket of dividend stocks and dividend ETFs offers exactly that. ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges and hold a diversified portfolio of stocks from various sectors and industries. By investing in dividend ETFs, investors can gain exposure to a wide range of companies, effectively eliminating risks associated with investing heavily in a single sector or stock. Dividend ETFs were popular among investors in 2022 but due to the tech rally last year, these funds also saw a decline in their inflows. Nevertheless, dividend funds gathered a total of $3.9 billion in 2023, which, unfortunately, is their lowest annual collection since 2009 (see 11 Best Dividend ETFs to Buy Now)\n\n12. Dividend Stocks Are Not Immune to Market Downturns:\n\nThe prices of dividend stocks can also fluctuate as these equities are not completely immune to market downturns. They can provide a hedge against inflationary periods, but that performance mainly depends on a number of factors. Dividend payments aren\u2019t guaranteed, unlike the interest payments from the Treasuries. Companies can reduce or eliminate their payouts at any point in time, a risk that became evident during the pandemic of 2020 when approximately 68 out of roughly 380 dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 either suspended or decreased their dividends.\n\n11. Dividend Stocks Can Outperform the Market During Fed Rate Hikes:\n\nHigh-interest rates have been a cause of worry for investors since 2022. In our article titled 13 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates, we highlighted that between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of 11 rate hikes to the federal funds rate. In addition to this, interest rates in the broader bond market rose, leading to increased borrowing expenses for both businesses and individuals. In this aspect, dividend stocks have offered investors a sense of relief as they typically hold up better during periods of high-interest rates.\n\nAccording to a report by ProShares, dividend growth strategies, which include companies that have raised their payouts consistently for years, are often considered reliable approaches that perform effectively across different interest rate climates. These strategies have demonstrated strong performance over the years regardless of fluctuations in interest rates. The report further mentioned that portfolios investing in dividend growth stocks can experience both capital appreciation and increasing dividend income streams, even in rising interest rate environments.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 10 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 15 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 11 Best April Dividend Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best defensive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the consumer defensive industry, head over to 5 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets.\n\nIn January 2024, Goldman Sachs strategists classified small-caps and consumer staples stocks as potential areas of value in the current US stock market. The strategists observed that the market rally has gone beyond mega-cap stocks, and they suggested three trades that offer value in this highly-valued market. First are small caps, represented by the Russell 2000, which now trade below their 10-year average price-to-book ratio. The strategists expect a potential return of roughly 15% for the Russell 2000 in the next 12 months. Secondly, Goldman Sachs strategists favor stocks with weak pricing power, which could benefit from improving profit margins in a solid economic growth environment. Lastly, consumer staples shares are seen as offering attractive valuations, particularly as concerns about higher costs and new weight-loss drugs' impact on consumer behavior show signs of stabilizing. The investment firm added that \u201cpessimism around the Consumer Staples earnings outlook has also shown signs of bottoming\u201d.\n\nSee Also: Investing in Innovation: 10 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs\n\nNik Modi, managing director and global co-head of consumer research at RBC Capital Markets, stated on BNN Bloomberg in January 2024 that it is challenging to generate profits in the consumer staple sector. However, he identified three companies with promising growth prospects in 2024 \u2013 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ). He commented:\n\n\u201cThere are bright spots \u2026 in this space and in an environment of underperformance, it really comes down to which companies have volume growth and which companies don\u2019t, and that\u2019s really what our top picks are oriented around.\u201d\n\nConsumer staples stocks faced challenges in 2023, but now with attractive valuations and the potential for rising profit margins and volumes in 2024, the sector may see better performance ahead, especially if defensive and dividend-paying stocks regain favor with investors, as perFidelity Investments. Last year, the defensive sector lagged behind as investors leaned towards mega-cap growth companies. Many firms faced difficulties amid a tough consumer environment marked by inflation and market share erosion to generic alternatives. Some companies responded by increasing discounts and advertising, though this didn't always translate to sales growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read: 12 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy\n\nThe packaged foods and meats segment, in particular, felt pressure from private-label alternatives and concerns regarding the impact of new weight-loss drugs on demand. On the other hand, household products companies benefited from improved gross profit margins due to lower input and freight costs. Fidelity noted that the sector's performance in 2024 hinges on the potential improvement in sales volumes, which could alleviate pricing pressure and enhance profit margins. Companies with appealing valuations and robust pricing power, especially in household products and soda, may present promising returns. Even with economic uncertainties, people keep buying everyday items, which could lead to more sales if consumers and the economy stay stable.\n\nSome of the best defensive stocks to buy include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). However, we discuss the best defensive ETFs in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe curated our list of the defensive (consumer staples, food and beverage, and total market exposure) ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

They turn grains and legumes into flour, protein meals, oils, starches, syrups, cellulose pulp, what have you. Almost everything on a dinner plate came through, in some fashion, ADM\u2019s hands. Yes, they have machinery, terminals, ships, railroad cars. And as an intermediary, theirs is a low-margin business. But it is a constant-spread business that earns a pretty stable margin on a very large sales base. When pricing rises for a period of time, that percentage spread is on a higher dollar amount, hence more dollars of income\u2014so income can rise nicely when agricultural commodities do. And there is the opportunity to expand their margins somewhat\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n11.

There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.\n\nHeckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company\u2019s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America\u2019s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman\u2019s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets\u2026\u201d (Click here to see the full text)\n\n10.

On March 7, Costco announced financial results for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2024, ending February 18, 2024. The company reported a non-GAAP EPS of $3.71, beating market estimates by $0.07, and a revenue of $58.44 billion, missing Street expectations by $690 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 57 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 65 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund stated the following regarding Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cCostco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) reported solid holiday results and announced a special dividend of $15 per share. Earnings were better than expected driven by better gross margin. Same store sales were 3.9% with solid traffic. Costco also noted better discretionary trends and solid seasonal sales.\u201d\n\n7. Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 25: 39.10%\n\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA) aims to match the performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. This index is weighted by market capitalization and covers the large, mid, and small-cap segments of the US consumer staples sector. Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA) is one of the best defensive ETFs to invest in. As of December 31, 2023, the fund\u2019s assets amounted to $1,061.5 million, and its portfolio consisted of 108 stocks, along with an expense ratio of 0.084%.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is the largest holding of Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA). On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the last quarter.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n6. Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 25: 45.77%\n\nInvesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) tracks the S&P SmallCap 600 Capped Consumer Staples Index, investing primarily in small-capitalization US consumer staples companies. The index measures the performance of US consumer staples companies primarily engaged in providing non-cyclical consumer goods and services such as tobacco, textiles, food and beverage, and non-discretionary retail. Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) ranks 5th on our list of the best defensive ETFs. As of March 22, 2024, the fund holds a portfolio of 30 stocks, featuring an expense ratio of 0.29%.\n\nWD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) is the top holding of Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC). The company develops and sells maintenance products, homecare, and cleaning products globally. On March 19, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 30, to shareholders on record as of April 19.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were long WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), up from 15 funds in the last quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital made the following comment about WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) markets a range of maintenance products, and homecare and cleaning products. We believe investors have unrealistic expectations about the company\u2019s ability to grow its revenue base enough to justify its valuation, and the company is likely to be less resilient as COVID-related tailwinds to its business subside. In Q3, shares of WD40 traded down on a weak earnings report that showed falling revenues as the company is also challenged by cost pressures.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts 14 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now 20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a014 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "1 Dividend Stock Near Its 52-Week Low to Buy Today",
        "content": "The stock market rally has made it harder for investors to find attractive deals these days. With the S&P 500 setting fresh records, many stocks are trading near -- if not at -- their all-time highs.\n\nYet there are always areas of the market that have fallen out of favor. Currently, investors are moving away from consumer staples giants like PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) due to their relatively weak short-term growth prospects. The beverage and snack food giant is facing some demand challenges, to be sure. But that's no reason to abandon this successful business. So let's look at why you might want to buy Pepsi's shareholder-friendly stock while it's trading close to its 52-week low.\n\nThe bad news\n\nThe stock's poor performance lately can be pinned entirely on Pepsi's slowing growth rate. Organic sales rose a healthy 10% in 2023 on top of big gains a year earlier, but things started to change for the worse in Q4. Growth decelerated to 4.5% from 9% in the prior quarter and management sees the slowdown continuing at least through fiscal 2024.\n\nTwo big factors are driving this moderation, though neither means that Pepsi is losing market share. Instead, shoppers are reverting to their pre-pandemic grocery spending habits after several years of elevated demand for snack foods and at-home beverage products. That shift is happening while inflation slows to further pressure sales growth. Together, these trends have Pepsi projecting that organic sales gains will land at just 4% this year, or less than half of last year's expansion rate.\n\nThe good news\n\nPepsi's efficient business can do a lot with modest growth, though.\n\nEarnings jumped 14% last year to outpace the 10% sales boost for the period. In other words, Pepsi grew sales while also widening its profit margin. Investors can expect to see another margin improvement in 2024 as the company cuts costs and focuses on popular niches like energy drinks and sparkling waters. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team are aiming to increase earnings at an 8% rate this year while sales rise by 4%.\n\nStory continues PEP Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nMeanwhile, you'll get plenty of direct cash returns by holding this dividend stock. In early February, Pepsi announced a 7% boost to its annual dividend payout, marking its 52nd consecutive hike. Few consumer-facing companies can claim anything approaching that half-century streak, and that's a testament to Pepsi's enduring competitive strengths.\n\nThe dividend increase, plus Pepsi's falling stock price, has pushed the yield up to about 3% from a low of 2.3% nearly a year ago. Pepsi's proven commitment to robust cash-sharing with shareholders indicates that dividends are likely to keep growing for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe price is right\n\nIn addition to that immediate income, you'll get exposure to some potentially market-thumping capital appreciation with this stock. Pepsi shares are trading at about 10% above their 52-week lows, after all. The valuation is sitting at 2.6 times annual sales compared to the more than 3 times sales that investors were paying last May. Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), for context, is priced at nearly 6 times revenue.\n\nPepsi isn't as profitable as that rival beverage giant, but it has a good chance at lifting sales and operating profit margin for yet another year in 2024. It won't matter to the investing thesis whether that growth is a bit below what investors have seen in the past several years.\n\nCombined with a rising dividend payment, these steady gains should help you see attractive returns from holding this strong, but currently unloved dividend stock. You should consider snapping PepsiCo shares up at today's discounted prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Dividend investing is one of the prominent ways to build wealth. Whether you are building a retirement portfolio, want to leave a legacy, or are looking to use the dividend income to cover your expenses, the right dividend stocks can make it possible. However, not all dividend stocks are the same. They can provide regular income but you need to ensure this income is consistent. This is why it makes sense to invest in companies that have a record of paying steady dividends. Consistency and stability are the two things you need to watch out for. Let\u2019s take a look at the seven dividend stocks you should buy with every dip.\u00a0With an improvement in the economy, we can expect these companies to offer dividend hikes throughout 2024.\n\nDividend Stocks: Rio Tinto (RIO) Mining cart in a silver, copper, and gold mine representing VOXR Stock.\n\nSource: TTstudio / Shutterstock\n\nIf you are hungry for a high dividend yield, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a great stock to own. With a dividend yield of 5.42%, the company could benefit from the rate cuts. One big reason to own the stock is the solid fundamentals.\u00a0It reported a free cash flow of $ 7.7 billion in 2023.\n\nRio Tinto has a dividend payout ratio of 80%, which is better than several companies today. It has recently announced an investment in the lithium industry. The company will invest\u00a0$350 million in Argentina for a lithium project and this could be a massive opportunity for it to cash in on the hot asset.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt has committed to an annual capital investment of $7 billion between 2024 and 2026 and this will pay off in the long-term. With inflation receding, Rio Tinto will see a drop in operating costs and we could see another dividend hike.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith a dividend yield of 1.24%, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) enjoys a strong presence in the tech industry. The company reported impressive financials and beat estimates. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Oracle is set to see higher growth in the coming years. It has a dividend payout ratio of 35% and considering the earnings potential, it can easily increase the payouts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fourth quarter, its cloud services saw a 45% increase in sales to hit $4.1 billion and it has robust guidance for the year. Trading at $129, the stock is up 23% year-to-date (YTD) and increased 46% in the year.\n\nThe company has been around for a long time and is rapidly building new data centers to meet the growing demand. For the current quarter, it is expecting earnings in the range of $1.62 to $1.66 per share. The management is aiming for sales of $65 billion by 2026.\n\nThere is an AI backlog and Oracle is making the most of the momentum. This is one stock that will not only generate passive income but also show capital gains in the next two years. It is a pure-play tech stock with the ability to reward investors significantly.\n\nDividend Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate building\n\nSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com\n\nA dividend aristocrat, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has raised its dividend payouts for 41 consecutive years. The oil and gas company is a key player in the industry and it will make significant cash flow driven by the oil prices at over $80 a barrel.\n\nThe company did not cut dividends even during the pandemic and enjoys a yield of 3.35%. It has a dividend payout ratio of 41% which shows that the dividend is sustainable and there is scope for an increase. The oil company generated\u00a0$55.4 billion of cash flow in 2023 and distributed $32.4 billion to the shareholders.\n\nIt declared a quarterly dividend of 95 cents per share which looks attractive for XOM stock trading at $113. The stock is up 10% YTD but any dip is worth buying. The elections and electric vehicle adoption could have an impact on the stock but I believe Exxon Mobil is relevant right now and has a long way to go.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nOne of the biggest industry players, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) enjoys a strong global presence, pricing power and brand loyalty. The demand for caffeinated beverages is expected to increase as summer approaches and I believe this will help the stock.\n\nMultiple price hikes have impacted the sales but I think the company is done with the hikes and the slowdown in sales could be temporary. PepsiCo has a dividend yield of 2.93% and the stock is trading at $172. The company has increased dividend payouts for 52 consecutive years and this speaks about its commitment to reward shareholders.\n\nThe stock has also grown 42% over the past five years. The management expects to see a\u00a04% rise in organic revenue this year. PepsiCo has a diversified business which shields it from the market movement and is highly relevant in the current environment.\n\nPepsiCo is growing in international markets and is one passive income stock that wouldn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nDividend Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top healthcare stock, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a dividend yield of 3.06% and has been increasing dividend payouts for more than 50 years. Having spun off the consumer products division, Johnson & Johnson is in a good position to see revenue growth driven by medical devices and innovative medicine.\n\nThe company saw a 7.3% rise in sales in the recent quarter where the pharmaceutical division surged 4.2% while the medical devices segment grew 13.3%. It enjoys stellar cash flow and has enough liquidity to keep rewarding shareholders.\n\nIt is one of the fastest-growing biotech companies with a strong pipeline of drugs and management expects to see annual growth between 5% to 7% between 2025 to 2030. Trading at $155 today, the stock is moving in the range of $145 to $162 and is at a discount right now. This is one stock to load up on whenever the market dips.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nYour favorite burger joint is a dividend-paying company. A dividend aristocrat, McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD)\u00a0has hiked dividends consecutively for 49 years and enjoys a yield of 2.36%. Trading at $283 today, the stock is down 4% YTD. It hit $300 in January but has dropped since then.\n\nThe food giant has a global presence and enjoys a competitive advantage in the industry. The company has a franchise business model which helps keep operating costs down and generates steady cash flow. It offers affordable meals which helped it thrive during the inflationary period. Lower prices, implementation of AI and menu innovation can help attract customers and we could see an improvement in sales.\n\nIt saw an\u00a08% YOY rise in net sales and a 3.4% rise in the same-store sales for the fourth quarter. Fundamentally, MCD is a strong company with the ability to rebound from the recent slip. Looking at the company\u2019s history and global presence, the stock looks highly undervalued to me.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) An image of three square ice cubes stacked up, a red Coco-Cola can, and a glass with ice and soda (from left to right) on a teal painted wood table.\n\nSource: FoodAndPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrading at $60 today, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) enjoys a dividend yield of 3.21% and is one of the top companies globally. It has a strong presence in the beverages industry and is diversifying into healthy drinks to meet the changing needs of consumers. A dividend aristocrat, Coca-Cola believes in rewarding shareholders and has increased dividends for over 60 years.\n\nWith Coca-Cola, do not expect any immediate upside because the stock has been moving sideways over the past few months. However, it will bring stability to any portfolio and generate passive income for you. In the recent quarter, it announced a dividend of 49 cents per share. A cultural phenomenon, Coca-Cola has over 200 drink options and caters to every age group.\n\nIt saw a 6% YOY rise in revenue in 2023 and the operating cash flow hit $11.6 billion. The company is well-positioned for growth and could see an improvement in sales during the months of summer. With a dividend payout ratio of 76%, KO stock is one of the best dividend stocks out there.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 stocks that paid special dividends in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2024.\n\nDividends are already a delectable treat for investors, but special dividends are the cherry on the cake. Companies that offer special dividends distribute significantly higher amounts of money annually than expected. That was precisely the move Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made in 2004. With a cash reserve of over $50 billion, the company distributed a one-time special dividend that was 38 times larger than its regular dividend of $0.08 per share. These special payments frequently coincide with the holiday season and are likened to year-end bonuses, providing investors with an extra financial boost as the new year approaches. In addition to this, these supplemental dividends can have a significant impact on retirement planning, as reported by Forbes. For example, even if an investment's headline yield seems low, like 1.3%, the total return with special dividends could be much higher, around 6%. Similarly, a 4% headline yield might not seem impressive, but with special dividends factored in, the total return could be as high as 11% annually.\n\nSpecial dividends have experienced fluctuations in popularity over time, with certain periods witnessing greater prevalence than others. Research published in the Journal of Financial Economics highlighted this trend, indicating that during the 1940s, a substantial 61.7% of dividend-paying firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) issued at least one special dividend. However, this figure dropped significantly to just 4.9% during the first half of the 1990s. Another research paper published in the Journal of Applied Finance emphasized that a company's choice to issue special dividends is connected to its investment opportunities, particularly focusing on growth prospects available within the current economic conditions. The paper examined different aspects of special dividends using research conducted by diverse financial analysts. According to the paper, special dividends serve as a method for managers to allocate excess cash flow to shareholders, addressing the issue of overinvestment. Erik Lie, a Norwegian finance professor, discovered in The Review of Financial Studies that special dividends act as a constraint on managerial excessive spending. Additionally, May Hu, an Associate Professor at RMIT University, suggested in her research paper that companies giving special dividends during economic downturns demonstrate responsible cash management when investment options are limited.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the number of special dividends distributed by US companies has varied over the years. In 2018, there were 48 instances of such dividends paid by S&P 100 companies, followed by a slight decrease to 43 in 2019, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, in 2021, there was a notable increase to 54, further escalating to 55 in 2022. Interestingly, in 2023 through June, the count dropped to 36, marking a significant decline compared to the preceding years. That said, on a global scale, investors received a record-breaking $1.66 trillion in dividends in 2023, as reported by Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index. This marked a significant increase of 5.6% compared to 2022 and an impressive spike of 18.6% from 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks in the US market that have paid regular dividends to shareholders for decades. However, in this article, we will discuss some of the best special dividend stocks. 11 Stocks that Paid Special Dividends in 2024\n\nPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we selected US companies that paid special dividends in 2024 so far.

        "content": "PURCHASE, N.Y., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PepsiCo today announced that it reached its 2025 global goal of a 25% improvement in operational water-use efficiency in high water-risk areas, two years ahead of schedule1. In addition, the company was recognized by\u00a0CDP, the global environmental non-profit, on the 2023 CDP A List for leadership in corporate transparency and performance on water security \u2013 putting PepsiCo in the top 0.5% of all 21,000 companies CDP scored.  PepsiCo (PRNewsfoto/PepsiCo, Inc.)\n\nAs part of pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) \u2013 the company's strategic end-to-end transformation \u2013 PepsiCo will continue working towards additional water stewardship ambitions, including aiming to be net water positive by 2030.\n\n\"Water is a fundamental human right and yet water insecurity remains a significant global challenge with billions of people lacking access to safe water,\" said Jim Andrew, Chief Sustainability Officer, PepsiCo. \"That's why good water stewardship is so important and has long been a priority for PepsiCo and the communities we serve. Our vision is that wherever in the world we operate, water resources will be in a better state than before we arrived. And while we're proud to have achieved this goal in high water-risk areas two years early, we will continue our unyielding focus on meeting our 2030 ambitions.\"\n\nPepsiCo saved billions of liters of water through several initiatives that contributed to reaching this goal. Crucial to these efforts were innovative technologies and shared best practices that were scaled globally through programs such as PepsiCo's in-house Resource Conservation Program and teams. Examples include:\n\nScaling a new approach to how we wash corn when making food products such as Tostitos, Fritos and Doritos to more than 100 global manufacturing lines within a year, with potential to save more than 640 million liters of water annually.  Implementing membrane bioreactor technology at 21 manufacturing sites globally, including 14 in high water-risk areas, to purify process water to drinking-level standards for reuse in operations, allowing a site to reduce its freshwater demand by an average of 70%.  Taking the water that's naturally found in potatoes and using it to help run food manufacturing facilities. Implemented at sites in India, Mexico, Poland and Thailand, this innovative technology developed by PepsiCo Research & Development teams captures and treats vapor that is released by potatoes when they are cooked for products such as Lay's and converts it to drinkable water that is used to help run manufacturing facilities. This process can save a single site up to 60 million liters of water per year.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo learn more about PepsiCo's water goals and progress, visit PepsiCo's ESG Topics A-Z.\n\nAbout PepsiCo \r\nPepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

        "title": "Pepsi takes on rival Coke\u2019s biggest client, landing its beverages and snacks in 20,000 Subway sandwich shops",
        "content": "Subway has become the latest front of the cola wars. Pepsi reached an agreement with the sandwich chain to become its sole drink supplier across all U.S. stores, replacing Coca-Cola,, Subway announced Tuesday. Subway also extended its preexistent contract with Pepsi-subsidiary Frito-Lay, which will provide snacks to the chain through 2030.\n\n\u201cFor nearly twenty years, The Coca-Cola Company has proudly served Subway restaurants in the U.S,\u201d Coca-Cola told Fortune in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to serving Subway through the end of this year and will remain focused on delivering value for Subway, their Franchisee Partners, and consumers.\u201d\n\nSubway customers will begin to see products like Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke replaced with Mountain Dew, Tropicana, and Gatorade starting in January 2025.\n\nThe deal is the latest step the snack and drink conglomerate has taken to usurp Coca-Cola as the highest-valued beverage company. Stocking Coke products in all 20,000 of its U.S. stores, Subway was Coca-Cola\u2019s biggest fountain account by number of store locations, per Beverage Digest. Subway has about 37,000 locations worldwide.\n\nThese supplier switches aren\u2019t unprecedented. On Monday, Cincinnati chain Skyline Chili announced it would switch from Pepsi to Coke products starting next month. Its midwestern neighbor, Wisconsin burger chain Culver\u2019s, made the same switch in January 2023.\n\nSubway has hung its hat on consistent positive same-store sales, including a 6.4% increase in global same-store sales in 2023 compared to the year before. It announced Tuesday a franchise agreement with private investment fund McWin that would see it open 600 new stores across Europe.\n\nSome of Subway\u2019s good fortune could also rub off on Pepsi, which saw slowed fourth-quarter revenue growth due to repeated price hikes, despite posting profits that exceeded expectations and 5.9% net revenue performance for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Coke posted a $641 million fourth-quarter gross profit, a 7% leap from the same period the year before. Net revenues grew 6% for 2023, according to its earnings report. Even with the loss of Subway, Coca-Cola still has something that Pepsi doesn\u2019t: growing sales volumes. It had 10% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales, per its earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cola duel continues\n\nThe two beverage giants have traded blows for decades and if Subway\u2019s deal with Pepsi is any indication, the two companies will continue to battle for the top spot in the beverage industry.\n\nThe soda industry in general has been hurt by high prices, weight loss drugs, and Gen Z\u2019s interest in healthier drink alternatives, yet Coke and Pepsi\u2019s strategies have differed in trying to compete with one another.\n\nCoke has been helped by its away-from-home sales\u2014like in movie theaters and restaurants\u2014in the past and has relied on international markets in Mexico and Germany to prop up sagging U.S. demand. The company also uses independent bottlers while Pepsi owns about 75% of its North American bottling operations. Meaning, Coke has to invest fewer resources in packaging beverages. While Coke has mastered the drinks market, Pepsi\u2019s success has been in huge part because of Frito-Lay, which nearly matched Pepsi\u2019s beverage revenue for most of 2023.\n\nBoth behemoths are taking big swings to attract Gen Z consumers: Coke recently launched a spicy flavor and \u201cHappy Tears,\u201d a salty, sugar-free soda sold in a chrome briefcase only on TikTok Shop. Pepsi\u2019s Doritos-flavored cocktail and promotion of its savory snacks as side dishes for meals similarly appeal to younger audiences.\n\nIn a hat tip to its beverage market, next week Pepsi will launch its first new product line in six years: Bubly Burst, a lightly sweetened seltzer that piggybacks on the Bubly line originally launched in 2018 to compete with La Croix. It\u2019s part of Pepsi\u2019s growing interest in better-for-you beverages that have surged in popularity among young people. Olipop, an independent company which brands itself as a healthy soda, is targeting $400 million in sales this year, up from $250 million last year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge will probably be just making sure that the product is like something people actually want to buy in bulk,\u201d Nik Sharma, CEO of brand strategy agency Sharma Brands, told Modern Retail.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 52-week low dividend stocks to consider. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their historical performance, and go directly to read 5 52-Week Low Dividend Stocks To Consider.\n\nDividend stocks experienced a tumultuous ride throughout 2023 and have struggled to bounce back. As of 2024, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of dividend stocks with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has only managed to climb by 3.17%, lagging behind the broader market's robust 8.57% year-to-date gain. The underperformance of dividend stocks can largely be attributed to the dominance of tech stocks in the spotlight last year. However, Meta's recent announcement of its inaugural dividend brings a glimmer of hope for investors, potentially offering a blend of growth and dividend opportunities.\n\nThat said, dividend stocks have demonstrated strong historical performance owing to their capacity to generate income, a feature that attracts investors to these stocks. Since 1926, dividends have accounted for roughly 32% of the overall return for the S&P 500 index, with capital gains making up the remaining 68%. Thus, it's evident that sustainable dividend income alongside the potential for capital appreciation are vital considerations for investors in shaping their expectations regarding total returns. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the Dividend Aristocrats index has historically shown superior returns with less volatility when compared to the broader S&P 500, resulting in enhanced risk-adjusted returns. This is evident from their ability to offer downside protection, as indicated by their upside and downside capture ratios. Specifically, the index has outperformed the S&P 500 during down months 69.34% of the time and during up months 43.61% of the time. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats have experienced lower drawdown levels in comparison to the benchmark index.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the recent underperformance and sluggish recovery of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending their inclusion in portfolios for income generation. Among the favored choices are dividend growers, as highlighted by prominent analysts. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group, emphasized the importance of dividend growers in a portfolio during an interview with CNBC. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cWe really believe that cash flow is king and dividend growers through time and their avoidance of a lot of burst bubbles that happen with the alternative end up doing better. We have tons of track records to prove that, but I think ultimately right now people have actually gotten away with this recovery trade since the 2022 meltdown.\u201d\n\nInvesting in dividend stocks like The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) could prove highly advantageous for investors. These companies have not only maintained a track record of regular dividend payments over the years but have also consistently increased their dividends for decades.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 30 undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nInvestors often grapple with the decision of whether to invest in growth stocks or value stocks. While both strategies aim to enhance value for investors, they follow distinct paths. The primary distinction lies in the pricing. Growth stocks tend to be pricier, with high valuations relative to their sales or earnings. Conversely, value stocks are more affordable, with lower stock prices in comparison to their sales or earnings. Over time, both growth and value investment approaches have demonstrated comparable performance, yet historical analysis indicates that value investing has been more advantageous for investors in the long term. According to research published by Josef Lakonishok, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny in the Journal of Finance, value strategies tend to yield superior returns. Various investment strategies centered around purchasing undervalued stocks have consistently outperformed those focused on trendy or high-flying stocks from April 1968 to April 1990.\n\nThe research paper also emphasized that value stocks typically offer significantly higher dividend yields and possess stronger fundamental ratios compared to growth stocks. Both Josef Lakonishok and the value investing expert David Dreman have observed that value investing outperforms growth investing approximately 70% of the time, regardless of the size of the companies involved. Their studies, which encompassed various company sizes, revealed that value stocks consistently delivered average returns of slightly over 7% per year higher than growth stocks over extended periods.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dividends are often a key component of value stocks. Among dividend strategies, one of the most popular approaches is investing in dividend aristocrats. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index tracks the performance of companies within the S&P 500 that have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. A report from S&P Dow Jones Indices indicated that strategies focusing on generating income often exhibit significant value characteristics. Investors typically gravitate towards securities offering high dividend yields and lower price multiples. The report also mentioned that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index demonstrated a blend of both growth and value traits, rather than a pronounced bias towards one style. Analysis of the index composition from 1999 to 2022 revealed its style breakdown. On average, the index maintained a 59.04% exposure to value stocks and a 40.94% exposure to growth stocks during this period.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the allure of high-priced growth stocks, value stocks have consistently proven to be advantageous for investors over the long haul. Dimensional Funds conducted an analysis spanning nearly a century, affirming that value stocks typically offer higher expected returns. While there have been occasional downturns, the fundamental principle that lower relative prices correlate with higher expected returns remains steadfast. Value premiums have often manifested swiftly and significantly. For instance, in years when value outperformed growth, the average premium amounted to nearly 15%. On average, in the US, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by 4.4% annually from 1927 to 2022.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR), and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) are some of the best dividend aristocrat stocks that are grabbing investors' attention.

        "content": "Nike downgraded, Pepsi upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\u00a0\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nMonness Crespi upgraded Snowflake (SNOW) to Neutral from Sell without a price target. The firm believes fiscal 2025 will be a challenging year for Snowflake, but upgrades the shares on valuation following the recent selloff. Morgan Stanley upgraded PepsiCo (PEP) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $190 price target. The firm names PepsiCo the firm's top pick, both in beverages and overall, replacing Constellation Brands (STZ) in beverages as it top pick and Colgate (CL) as its overall top pick in consumer packaged goods. Bernstein upgraded Charter (CHTR) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $370 price target, reflecting a 25% upside. While the firm acknowledges that Charter has a clear set of challenges to navigate near-term, it believes the market has more than priced in these risks given the potential persistence of them. CLSA upgraded Futu Holdings(FUTU) to Outperform from Underperform with a price target of $65, up from $50. While a further share correction could be possible in the near-term, the company's growth potential in the mid- to long-term is promising, the firm says. BofA upgraded Pinnacle West (PNW) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $80, up from $71. The firm sees the adoption of the System Reliability Benefit, or SRB, surcharge, the regulator-led initiative towards a forward or hybrid test year and the Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, consideration process pointing to an improving earnings and growth outlook through the end of the decade given the improving regulatory environment for the Arizona-based regulated utility.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nWilliams Trading downgraded Nike (NKE) to Sell from Hold with a price target of $85, down from $92. \"Nike's strength continues to diminish,\" the firm says, adding that it believes \"consultants, rather than Nike experts are leading strategy decisions, senior leaders are too dogmatic, and do not welcome all opinions.\" Evercore ISI downgraded Prologis (PLD) to In Line from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $136. The firm cites the stock's lower relative ranking along with limited upside to estimates for the downgrade. Telsey Advisory downgraded Hibbett (HIBB) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $74, down from $82. The company's 2024 is projected to be a more difficult year than anticipated with the comp flat to down low single digits and operating margin contraction, the firm tells investors in a research note. Williams Trading also downgraded Hibbett to Hold from Buy with a $73 price target. Evercore ISI downgraded Invitation Homes(INVH) to In Line from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $36. While the firm continues to like the single family rental space over apartments due to the stickier nature of the renter base, limited new construction of homes across the U.S. and elevated mortgage rates, it sees limited upside in estimates and therefore less upside in the stock. JPMorgan downgraded Terex (TEX) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $63. The firm sees limited upside to Street estimates in 2024 and 2025 as the company indexes higher versus Oshkosh (OSK) to Europe, which remains weak.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nCiti resumed coverage of Thermo Fisher(TMO) with a Neutral rating and $620 price target. While the firm continues to view Thermo as a \"well-entrenched diversified player\" and believes management has mostly de-risked this year, Citi moves to the sidelines given the recent multiple expansion and its 2025 numbers below consensus. Wolfe Research initiated coverage of Dynatrace (DT) with an Outperform rating and $60 price target. The firm is bullish on the company's market opportunity, product cycle, and \"differentiation\" from offering full stack observability. RBC Capital initiated coverage of Howmet Aerospace(HWM) with an Outperform rating and $75 price target. The firm believes the company's position as a \"high-quality\" aerospace engine supplier \"will keep it in favor.\" Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Ball Corp.(BALL) with an Equal Weight rating and $68 price target. The firm says that while near- and long-term catalysts can drive earnings upside, near-term volumes may be pressured from weak consumer demand and the company's exposure to the secularly challenged beer market.

        "content": "Indra Nooyi may have led one of the world\u2019s top soda purveyors for 12 years\u2014but she keeps her advice sugar-free.\n\nOver the course of the former PepsiCo CEO\u2019s decade-plus tenure\u2014during which sales grew 80%\u2014Nooyi was named the most powerful women in business by Fortune five years in a row. She stepped down from the CEO role in 2018 and retired from PepsiCo\u2019s board in 2019, after 24 years with the company.\n\nAt the 2019 Fortune Most Powerful Women conference, Nooyi was asked for her thoughts on balancing family and work as a woman. \u201cTo integrate work and family is going to be a challenge,\u201d Nooyi said, and the first issue that needs to be addressed is unconscious bias in the workplace.\n\n\u201cWhen bias happens in the workforce, it strips away a woman's confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it attacks your confidence, it attacks your competence.\u201d\n\nHow can women address the \u201cvicious circle\u201d of unconscious bias? Nooyi found inspiration in an unexpected place: Sex and the City. It was Carrie & Co.\u2019s Manolo Blahnik shoes and Christian Dior dresses that first caught Nooyi\u2019s attention\u2014but she ended up learning a surprising lesson from the show\u2019s four main characters.\n\n\u201cTheir sisterhood was so strong, they never judged each other, they supported each other,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cThey could talk about Mr. Big in a very private environment.\u201d\n\nWorking women need their own sisterhoods, Nooyi continued, and to work together to call out unconscious biases. \u201cWe tend to compete with ourselves, and I think it's getting better, but we have to really step it up.\u201d she told Fortune in 2015.\n\nAnd yes, Nooyi admitted to taking time out of her busy schedule to binge-watch the HBO show. \u201cI loved the first episode, so I watched all 94 episodes of it, staying up at night,\u201d she said.\n\nBiological clock vs. career clock\n\nAlthough she has led an illustrious career, Nooyi, who has two daughters, shared that she had felt \u201cguilt\u201d over balancing family and work. As she said at the 2014 Aspen Ideas Festival: \u201cThe biological clock and the career clock are in total conflict with each other.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u200b\u200bThe years women often dedicate to career development frequently overlap with the years they are expected to have children, Nooyi said. Children become teenagers just as their mothers rise to middle management, and \u201cthat\u2019s the time your husband becomes a teenager,\u201d Nooyi joked. As the years pass, aging parents require care as well.\n\n\"We're screwed,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cWe cannot have it all.\"\n\nAt the Aspen event, Nooyi shared an unconventional tip for coping with the guilt of not being able to dedicate more time to her home life. Her daughter\u2019s school hosted weekly Wednesday morning \u201cclass coffees\u201d with students\u2019 mothers. When her daughter got home, she would name all the mothers who were there: \u201cYou were not there, mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first few times, I would die with guilt, but I developed coping mechanisms,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cI called the school and I said, give me a list of mothers who were not there.\u201d\n\nThe next time her daughter brought up the class coffees, Nooyi listed off the other moms who didn\u2019t show up. \u201cI\u2019m not the only bad mother,\u201d she laughed.\n\nOpening doors\n\nNooyi left PepsiCo in 2019 after 24 years with the company. Today, she serves on the boards of Amazon and the International Cricket Council. She has been celebrated for introducing design thinking and developing a culture of learning at PepsiCo\u2014and being one of the first, and few, women of color to lead a Fortune 500 company.\n\n\u201cGiven my background and where I come from\u2014crossing oceans as an immigrant, a person of color, a woman\u2014ascending to lead this iconic company was a tough slog,\u201d Nooyi toldFortune\u2019s Emma Hinchliffe in 2022.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see the most unusual, improbable people ascending to the top,\u201d she continued. \u201cLet\u2019s give them the tools to move ahead.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nFleeing one\u2019s home, with or without family members, and leaving behind prized possessions and a life, is a traumatic experience that millions of people go through every year. Amidst the plethora of bleak realities of life, the existence of millions of refugees stands as another sad fact. The forceful displacement of people has existed in the past, persists to this day, and will likely continue until the end of times. Both the US law and the United Nations' 1951 Refugee Convention (an international agreement signed by 149 countries to protect refugees) define refugees as individuals seeking entry into another country who can prove they have been persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nRefugees: A Global Overview\n\nAccording to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), by mid-2023, 110 million people had been forcibly displaced due to 'persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or events seriously disturbing public order.' Among these, 36.4 million are refugees. Remarkably, 52% of all refugees and individuals in need of international protection hail from just three countries: the Syrian Arab Republic (6.5 million), Afghanistan (6.1 million), and Ukraine (5.9 million). It's noteworthy that 3.4 million of these refugees are hosted by two Muslim-majority countries, namely The Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey. Following closely are Germany, hosting 2.5 million refugees, Colombia with just under 2.5 million refugees (including others in need of international protection), and Pakistan with 2.1 million refugees. Also check out our article 20 Most Refugee-Hosting Countries in the World for a detailed outlook.\n\nAnother troubling statistic is the number of children born as refugees, which reached 1.9 million (with 385,000 children born as refugees annually from 2019 to 2022). Furthermore, it was observed that the majority (69%) of refugees and individuals in need of protection relocated to neighboring countries, with low and middle-income countries accommodating 75% of these individuals. On a positive note, 463,500 refugees returned to their home countries in the first half of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nRefugees in the US\n\nAs the world's leading country resettling refugees, the United States has been welcoming them for decades. The country has provided assistance to approximately 650,000 displaced individuals from Europe after World War II, as well as people fleeing communist regimes in Europe and Asia during the Cold War, among others. Some US states, such as Texas, California, and New York, have accepted the largest numbers of refugees.\n\nIn 1980, the government established a permanent standardized system for identifying, vetting, and resettling refugees, known as the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). However, the number of refugees admitted to the country has seen a decline from 200,000 in 1980 to 60,014 in 2023. The figures have fluctuated sharply over the years, depending on the prevailing strategies of the time. For instance, the 9/11 attacks led to a suspension of refugee admissions for several months. The ceilings for admission have also changed according to the administration and the global conditions. While President Obama's administration increased the ceiling to 110,000 in 2017 following the crises in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Trump administration reduced it to 50,000 in 2017 and further down to 18,000 for 2020. However, the Biden administration has reversed these previous ceilings and set the cap at 125,000 for fiscal years 2023 and 2024.\n\nBig US Companies Stepping-Up\n\nAt the 2022 Tent Business Summit, 45 major companies and brands, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) pledged to hire and train 22,725 refugees for full-time positions in the US.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced plans to hire 5,000 refugees over three years, while Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) committed to hiring 2,500, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HLT) to 1,500, and both PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) to 500 each. These collective efforts are expected to generate $913 million in income for refugees. Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) VP of Employee Relations, WW Amazon Stores and Corporate, emphasized the importance of diversity within the company and expressed their commitment to hiring individuals in need. 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\n20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the US, we examined data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics and the U.S. Department of State's report on 'Refugee Arrivals by Region and Country of Nationality: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2022.' We focused on figures from the year 2022 and organized our list in an ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet us now take a look at our list for 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\n20. Central African Republic\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 181\n\nA landlocked country in the heart of Africa, the Central African Republic has been besieged by armed conflict and instability for years. Additionally, it is considered one of the poorest states in the world. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 2023, more than 1.4 million people in the Central African Republic have been displaced from their homes, which accounts for about one-third of the country\u2019s population. Since 2013, armed conflict between various groups has forced many residents (more than 640,000) to flee the country, while approximately 630,000 have been displaced internally. Some have sought refuge in neighboring countries, while others have migrated to the US.\n\n19. Armenia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 198\n\nFor a long time, Armenians have been immigrating to the US and settling, primarily in California. Historical events such as the Hamidian massacre of the mid-1890s, the Adana Massacre of 1909, and the Armenian genocide of 1915-1918 have contributed to this migration. More recently, factors such as war defeats and poor economic conditions in the country have compelled many to leave their homes. Many have found their way to the US, making them one of the countries with most refugees in the US.\n\n18. Burundi\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 219\n\nAn East Central African country with a population of 12.2 million, thousands have fled their country to avoid persecution due to their political beliefs. The refugee crisis began in 2015 following political unrest between civilians and the government. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), approximately 333,700 refugees have sought a safe haven in various countries, including the US. In 2015, 1,218 Burundi refugees arrived in the US. However, this figure steadily decreased until 2020, after which it began to increase once more.\n\n17. Colombia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 254\n\nFor over 40 years, millions of Colombians have been forced to flee their country due to ongoing conflict. The war between the Colombian government, guerrilla groups like FARC and ELN, paramilitaries, and narco-traffickers has resulted in the loss of 50,000 to 200,000 lives. Additionally, it has internally displaced 3.5 million people and caused 500,000 to 750,000 Colombian refugees in neighboring countries. Some have sought refuge in the US, with their numbers fluctuating over the years.\n\n16. Iran\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 258\n\nThe 1979 revolution sparked the largest wave of Iranians leaving the country. The Iran-Iraq war and subsequent failed political reforms further worsened the situation. In the past decade, people have been compelled to seek refuge in other countries due to political oppression, social unrest, and religious persecution, leading to reports of many unaccompanied children fleeing to Europe. Refugees are also seeking asylum in the US, making it one of the countries with the highest number of Iranian refugees. While refugee arrivals were much higher in the years 2013-2017, they have since decreased.\n\n15. Ethiopia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 266\n\nEthiopia is another country that has contributed a significant number of refugees to the US. The 1980 Refugee Act marked the beginning of Ethiopians moving to the US, largely driven by the repressive regime of Mariam. Additionally, many Ethiopians who had previously migrated to Sudan also sought relocation to the US. The number of refugees arriving in the country has fluctuated over the years, with a slower rate of arrivals depicted in recent years.\n\n14. South Sudan\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 290\n\nThe largest refugee crisis in Africa and the third-largest in the world, approximately 2.4 million South Sudanese have fled to neighboring countries, while 2.3 million are internally displaced, as of July 2023, according to the UNHCR. This crisis has primarily been triggered by civil wars in the country, along with economic decline, disease, and hunger. Sudanese refugees have been accepted into the US since 2001 and continue to arrive to this day, becoming one of the country with the most refugees in the US.\n\n13. Eritrea\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 317\n\nEritrea has long been recognized as one of the most repressive countries globally, characterized by the denial of basic rights such as freedom of speech and religion, as well as compulsory mass conscription for individuals aged 18-50. Consequently, according to UNHCR, as of June 2023, there are approximately 580,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers worldwide. The UN Refugee Agency has played a significant role in resettling many Eritrean refugees in the US. Although arrivals have tapered off in recent years, the country has experienced significant influxes at times. For instance, around 1,900 refugees arrived in the US in both 2016 and 2017.\n\n12. Honduras\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 447\n\nAccording to the US Customs and Border Protection, Honduras is among the countries contributing the highest number of refugees to the southern US border. Several factors contribute to this movement, including natural disasters such as droughts and floods, as well as issues like corruption, poverty, and lawlessness in the country. In 2022, there was a significant increase in the number of Honduran refugees arriving in the US-- 447 compared to 83 in 2021.\n\n11. Somalia\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 491\n\nThe Somali refugee crisis stands as one of the largest mass displacements witnessed globally. For over thirty years, individuals from Somalia have fled to neighboring areas, primarily due to political instability, the civil war in the 1990s, and conflicts such as the one in the city of Laascaanood. According to UNHCR, approximately 714,390 Somali refugees and asylum seekers are living in nearby countries. A large number of these refugees have also sought refuge in the US. While the number of arrivals has declined in recent years, Somalia remains one of the countries with the highest number of refugees in the US.\n\n10. Iraq\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 501\n\nThe 2003 US invasion resulted in approximately 1 in 25 Iraqis being displaced, a situation exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of the Islamic State. According to UNHCR, as of April 2023, about 1.2 million Iraqis have been displaced. Many Iraqis have sought refuge in the US as refugees, with numbers as high as slightly over 19,000 in both 2013 and 2014. However, the numbers have steadily decreased over the years.\n\n9. Moldova\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 511\n\nThe civil war of 1992 resulted in the displacement of many Moldovans internally and as refugees across various countries. While some returned after the conflict ended, their integration into society was largely ignored by the government. Moldovan refugees have been arriving in the US for quite some time, with their numbers fluctuating. There was a substantial increase from 75 in 2021 to 511 in 2022.\n\n8. El Salvador\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 524\n\nEl Salvador has endured prolonged organized crime, violence, poverty, and numerous socioeconomic challenges, compounded by natural disasters and the recent Ukraine situation. As a result, many people have been forced to flee the country in search of a better future for their next generation, often ending up at the southern border of the US. A significant surge in refugee arrivals was recorded by the US government in 2017, after which the number has steadily declined.\n\n7. Guatemala\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 1,084\n\nThe deteriorating situation in the country across various aspects is driving refugee arrivals in the US. The presence of violence and worsening socioeconomic conditions, exacerbated by poverty and climate shocks, has made life in the country very challenging for some people, compelling them to seek refuge at the US southern border. Since 2016, their annual arrivals have been on the rise, reaching an all-time high of 1,084 registered in 2022.\n\n6. Ukraine\n\nNumber of Refugee Arrival: 1,586\n\nThe February 2024 war in Ukraine has led to devastating consequences, displacing 3.7 million people internally and creating 6.5 million refugees spread across neighboring countries. Ukrainian refugees have also been arriving in the US. While the number steadily rose to an all-time high in 2020, registering 4,432 refugees, it began to decline before escalating once more in 2022.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Best Places to Live in Florida 50 Cities With The Largest Population In The US 20 Countries with Highest Net Migration\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Countries with the Most Refugees in the U.S. is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 20 most food insecure states in the US. If you want to read about other most food insecure states in the US, go directly to 5 Most Food Insecure States in the US.\n\nIn 2022, food insecurity remained a pressing concern across the United States, affecting approximately 12.8 percent of households. This distressing statistic indicates that a significant portion of the population faced challenges in providing enough food for all household members due to limited resources. The issue of food insecurity highlights the persistent struggle that many Americans endure in accessing an adequate and consistent food supply, which is essential for maintaining health and well-being.\n\nTo address the problem of food insecurity, federal spending on the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food and nutrition assistance programs totalled $183.0 billion in fiscal year 2022. While this allocation represents a substantial investment in combating hunger, it is noteworthy that this figure reflects a 6 percent decrease from the previous year when adjusted for inflation. Despite the substantial funding directed towards food assistance programs, the prevalence of hunger in the United States continued to rise. According to USDA data, 10.8 percent of American households experienced hunger in 2023, marking an increase from 10.4 percent in 2021.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it becomes increasingly imperative to delve deeper into the specific regions within the country where food insecurity is most acute. By examining the 20 most food insecure states in the US, we can gain valuable insights into the localized factors contributing to this pressing issue. Understanding the unique challenges faced by these states, such as economic disparities, limited access to affordable and nutritious food, and barriers to food assistance programs, is crucial for developing targeted interventions and policies to address food insecurity effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough comprehensive analysis and concerted efforts, we can work towards creating a more equitable food system that ensures all individuals and families have access to sufficient and nutritious food. By shedding light on the 20 most food insecure states in the US, we can initiate meaningful dialogue, raise awareness, and drive action to address this critical issue and strive towards a future where hunger is eradicated for all Americans. So many companies have been taking initiatives to combat this problem below are a few that have made their mark in this struggle.\n\nGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS)\n\nGeneral Mills (NYSE:GIS) plays a pivotal role in combating hunger and food waste through various initiatives. As a founding partner of Feeding America, the Global Food Banking Network, and Partners in Food Solutions, the company has facilitated over 201 million meals globally since 2010 through food donations. Additionally, General Mills has partnered with MealConnect to recover and distribute more than 575 million pounds of surplus food in collaboration with 90 food banks. This effort has involved over 1.2 million food pickups and supported over 4,200 non-profit hunger relief organizations since 2014.\n\nFurthermore, the company sponsors the annual Feeding Better Futures Scholars Program, engaging young innovators across North America to propose solutions addressing hunger relief, food waste, and sustainable agriculture.

For reporting purposes, the USDA classifies households into two categories based on their level of food security. Those with high or marginal food security are considered food secure, while those experiencing low or very low food security are categorized as food insecure. This classification is determined by the household's responses to a series of questions regarding behaviours and experiences related to difficulty in meeting food needs. These questions assess a wide range of severity levels of food insecurity, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by households in accessing an adequate and consistent food supply. The higher the percentage, the higher the food insecurity in that state.\n\nIn cases where states share the same percentage of food insecure households, the ranking is determined by the total number of households. States with a greater total number of households, and consequently a higher count of food insecure households, are placed higher on the list. So, using this approach, we have listed down the 20 most food insecure states in the US.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "The major market indexes have surged to new highs as growth stocks take the spotlight once again. However, many investors like to have some passive income to get by when the inevitable dip occurs.\n\nHere's why three Motley Fool contributors believe PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP), Williams-Sonoma(NYSE: WSM), and Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) are great dividend stocks to buy right now.\n\nA classic dividend stock\n\nJohn Ballard (PepsiCo): Companies that sell goods that people buy every day can make for solid income investments. PepsiCo is one of the best consumer brands to consider. It has a leading position in snacks and beverages, with a large portfolio of brands like Quaker Oats, Doritos, and Gatorade. Last year, the company generated $9 billion in profit, which funded its 52nd year of dividend increases.\n\nPepsiCo is still capable of delivering growth to keep growing the dividend for many years. Management sees tremendous opportunities in developing markets and fast-growing categories like energy drinks.\n\nThe dividend should continue to increase as the business expands. Management's long-term goal is to deliver adjusted earnings growth in the high-single-digit range on an annualized basis.\n\nPepsiCo's above-average yield highlights the value in the shares right now. The current dividend yield is 3.05%, which is about twice the market average. The combination of earnings growth and the yield should deliver total shareholder returns on par with the major market indexes.\n\nThis resilient retailer just gave investors a raise\n\nJeremy Bowman (Williams-Sonoma): You might be surprised to learn that shares of Williams-Sonoma, the high-end home furnishings retailer, have more than doubled over the last year.\n\nEven in a challenging market for home goods with sluggish real estate sales and high interest rates, Williams-Sonoma continues to generate strong profits and has kept nearly all of its revenue gains from the pandemic.\n\nEven as comparable sales fell 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter, reflecting the sector-wide challenges, Williams-Sonoma drove impressive margin expansion with gross margin up 480 basis points to 46%. As a result, its operating margin rose from 19.2% to 20.1%, and earnings per share increased from $5.28 to $5.44 as the bottom line continued to benefit from share repurchases.\n\nStory continues\n\nBetter yet, Williams-Sonoma surprised investors with a 26% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.13 a share, and announced a new $1 billion share buyback program, a sign of confidence in the business and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\n\nThe company's guidance indicates the worst of the sector downturn is behind it as it sees revenue stabilizing this year, calling for flat top-line growth, and for operating margin to improve from 16.1% to 16.5%-16.8%. That, along with share buybacks, should drive earnings growth this year, and over the longer term, the company should benefit from the expected decline in interest rates and a recovery in the housing market, which will promote spending on home furnishings.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma also reaffirmed its guidance of mid- to high-single-digit annual revenue growth and operating margin in the mid to high teens.\n\nWith a dividend yield of 1.6%, the retailer might not wow income investors, but it has the right formula for consistent dividend increases and steady earnings growth, and it looks well set up to reward long-term investors.\n\nThe largest coffee chain in the world\n\nJennifer Saibil (Starbucks): Starbucks is by far the largest coffee shop chain in the world, with more than 38,500 stores. However, it's nowhere near finished in its expansion efforts, and management thinks it can reach 55,000 stores over the next few years. That could propel it to the largest restaurant chain in the world.\n\nAt this point, Starbucks runs a smooth operation. It can open hundreds of stores in a quarter and hit the ground running with a model that works and customers love, leading to high profits and strong comparable sales (comps) growth. It has continued to generate increased sales after a pandemic dip despite global economic and geopolitical volatility. And when it was worried about getting stale, it brought in a new CEO to refresh and improve. It has launched several recent initiatives to revitalize the brand, such as on-demand single-cup brewing machines and a larger food menu. It's focusing on its membership program, which builds Starbucks' relationship with its most loyal customers and leads to higher engagement and sales.\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 31), sales were up 8% year over year driven by a 5% increase in comps. Operating margin widened to 15.8%, and earnings per share were up 20% to $0.90.\n\nAs Starbucks has moved from a growth stock to a value stock, it's focusing on its dividend to create shareholder value. It yields 2.5% at the current price, well above the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. On top of that, it has increased its dividend by 340% over the past 10 years, far more than classic dividend stocks like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble.\n\nStarbucks has been dealing with many problems lately, including high union sentiment at many of its branches, and its stock is down 7% over the past year. But its fortunes could quickly change, and it could return to beating the market along with paying a reliable and growing dividend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "The best investment portfolios usually include at least a few dividend-paying stocks, and you can lock in a great yield by finding the ones representing great companies that are temporarily out of favor with investors. PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) is one such company. This stalwart of the consumer staples sector has seen its share price drop over the past few months, but its long-term potential as a cash flow powerhouse is still compelling.\n\nPepsiCo dropped while the market climbed\n\nSince July 1, 2023, PepsiCo shares are trading down almost 11%. Over that same timeframe, the S&P 500 gained 16% while Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) stayed roughly flat. ^SPX Chart\n\nPepsi's stock is lagging for a few different reasons. The company has struggled with revenue and volume growth over the past year. It increased prices in reaction to rising costs, which hurt demand among price-conscious consumers who are struggling with inflation across the board.\n\nSome of its distributors have raised concerns that the price hikes are excessive, so the company is unlikely to drive growth from additional price hikes moving forward. It needs to rely on rising unit volume to keep expanding, at least in the short term. Unfortunately, some investors are speculating that weight loss drugs could seriously curb the consumption of snack foods and that widespread use of those pharmaceuticals could hurt PepsiCo, along with its industry peers.\n\nPepsiCo's 10% stock price drop isn't an enormous one, but it's enough to warrant a look from income investors. If the recent concerns are overblown, then this could be an opportunity to lock in a long-term dividend stream at a more attractive yield. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nPepsiCo is one of the most stable companies around\n\nPepsiCo operates a business that isn't exciting from a growth perspective, but it doesn't have many rivals when it comes to stability. That should be a priority for dividend stocks, because those investments tend to thrive when the underlying business has predictable cash flow expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are dozens of household brand names under the PepsiCo umbrella, spanning various beverage, snack, and grocery categories. These include Frito-Lay, Quaker, Doritos, Gatorade, Smartfood, Sabra, and others that most people don't even realize fall under the PepsiCo umbrella. Its Frito-Lay and Quaker divisions accounted for more than half of its North American revenue last year, so the product diversification is meaningful financially. Contrary to what people might think, PepsiCo isn't just a rival to Coca-Cola -- it has a unique and broad product portfolio.\n\nPepsiCo is also geographically diversified, with a presence in more than 200 countries around the world. It still has heavy concentration in North America, which accounts for nearly 60% of total company revenue, but this is a truly global business that doesn't depend on any one nation's economy to prosper.\n\nA cash flow machine\n\nPepsiCo is a Dividend King with 51 consecutive years of dividend growth. The stock currently sports a 3% yield after raising its quarterly dividend to $1.265 per share. Over the past decade, the company's revenue and cash flows have slowly marched higher, with an average annual growth rate in the 3% to 5% range. PEP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPepsiCo's dividend payout ratio of 73% has been somewhat volatile in recent years, which could cast doubt on its ability to continue raising its dividend if sales growth struggles with macroeconomic headwinds. That's something to monitor moving forward, but the company generated $1 billion more free cash flow than it distributed to shareholders last year.\n\nIf the broader economy keeps improving over the next year or two, PepsiCo is likely to deliver suitable financial results. The company is forecasting 4% revenue growth and 8% earnings growth in 2024, after adjusting for the effect of currency fluctuations, acquisitions, divestitures, and additional reporting weeks that occur every fifth or sixth fiscal year.\n\nFundamental performance over the past two years makes the divergence from Coca-Cola look exaggerated. On a percentage basis, PepsiCo has nearly kept pace with its rival on the top line, and it compares favorably when it comes to earnings, cash flow, and dividends. PEP Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPepsiCo isn't immune from challenges moving forward, but it's a dividend powerhouse with a diverse business and strong competitive position that contributes to reliable cash flows. Its 3% yield at the moment because of a reduced stock price is a compelling reason for long-term income investors to consider buying in.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "Want $400 a Year in Passive Income? Invest $13,000 in This Dow Dividend Giant",
        "content": "Dividend investors are being offered a sparkling deal on Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) stock these days. The beverage giant's yield is sitting just above 3% as of this writing, which means you could receive an income of $400 per year by putting about $13,000 to work in the stock.\n\nOf course, you'd want to make an investment like this in the context of a diversified portfolio that includes exposure to many other sectors and business types. But Coke can be a highly positive force in such a portfolio. Let's look at a few reasons why.\n\nLatest results\n\nCoke's\u00a0mid-February earnings report contained plenty of good news for its shareholders. Organic sales were up a robust 12% in the fourth quarter, management said, outpacing rival PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP). Coke benefits from its higher proportion of on-the-go beverage sales and its more focused portfolio. It is also helping it right now to not have a large exposure to snack foods as PepsiCo does.\n\nCoke is also finding success with its push into non-traditional beverage categories like energy drinks and sparkling waters. \"We're confident that our all-weather strategy, powerful portfolio, and harmonized system will continue to create value for our stakeholders,\" CEO James Quincey said in the Q4 press release. Yet Wall Street has modest expectations for the business. Most analysts project that sales will be flat this year, which helps explain why Coke's stock is available at a relative discount after having sat out the market's rally over the past year.\n\nEarnings and profits\n\nMeanwhile, its earnings are expanding quickly, putting shareholders in a great position to patiently hold this stock while they collect passive income. Coke's operating margin rose to an industry-leading 23% of sales in Q4, helping power an earnings jump of 13% for the year. That 2023 increase rises to a blazing 21% after adjusting for currency exchange rate shifts.\n\nCash production looks just as strong, with free cash flow again landing at about $10 billion for 2023. This performance allowed management to direct nearly $2 billion toward stock buybacks. But Coke's bigger priority is clearly its dividend. Coke spent $8 billion on dividend payments in 2023, up from $7.6 billion in 2022. Look for another significant payout boost later in 2024, which will mark Coke's 62nd consecutive annual hike.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe price is right\n\nYou'll have to pay a bit of a premium for Coca-Cola stock, at least compared to some other consumer staples giants. PepsiCo shares trade at 2.5 times annual sales, less than half of Coke's valuation.\n\nBut Coke is much more profitable, sporting a 28% profit margin compared to Pepsi's 14%. The company is growing more quickly, too, with both sales volumes and profits rising in the past full year. Pepsi, in contrast, had to rely exclusively on price hikes to keep its overall sales rising.\n\nThe good news is that dividend investors can sit back and collect passive income from Coca-Cola while they wait for its stock returns to better match up with its excellent financial metrics. Whether you can put $1,300 or $13,000 to work in this business today, you'll likely be happy with the over 3% immediate yield. Sure, there are faster-growing stocks available outside of the consumer staples niche.

        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 30 high-quality street foods in the world. To skip our detailed analysis of the global food industry in 2024, go directly and see 10 High-Quality Street Foods in the World.\n\nFood Industry in 2024: Emerging Trends\n\nIn 2024, the global food and beverages industry is undergoing a massive transformation, marked by certain emerging trends which are likely to drive consumer demand in the coming decade, owing to increasing prevalence of alternative food sources, sustainable practices, hyperlocal sourcing, and integration of new technologies like AI and machine-learning. In 2023, consumer interest in plant-based alternatives peaked especially with regards to high-quality street foods in the world, with skyrocketing innovation and expansion in plant-based meats and seafood, dairy alternatives, and protein-rich substitutes.\n\nIn 2024, the sustainability trend is likely to persist with an increased focus on circular economy and local sourcing. Top players in the food and beverage industry like Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) are diverting greater investments into the immediate reduction of food waste, advancements in eco-friendly packaging, and optimization of energy-efficient operations. Certifications like organic and fair trade, and transparent supply chains are to remain integral in curating a sustainable and ethical food landscape in the years to come. Another trend driving the food and beverage industry in 2024 is the increasing focus on personalized nutrition, clean labels, and ethical sourcing. Companies are looking to increase their footprint in areas like on-the-go food alternatives like some high-quality street foods in the world, global culinary exploration, and health-centric product portfolios, catalyzing further growth in e-commerce and D2C consumer models. Furthermore, rampant blockchain adoption for traceable supply chain lines are consolidating across the industry, ensuring that consumers have complete confidence in the safety and integrity of their food purchase decisions, especially when it comes to having some high-quality street foods in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, companies in the food industry are renewing focus on personalized nutrition by way of integrating advanced technology, resulting in cutting-edge formulations which place greater emphasis on efficacy and safety. The integration of AI with popular nutrition applications is widely projected to revolutionize the way consumers engage with food options and create dietary schedules. The new landscape will shed light on innovative ingredients and technologies which are molding the future of the food and beverage industry in 2024. To read more on trends affecting the food industry in 2024, check out our coverage of the Healthiest Food in the World: Top 20 Countries with the Healthiest Diets.\n\nSustainability in the Food Industry: An Analysis\n\nThroughout the late-twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, rising rates of population growth have resulted in an increased global demand for nutrition. In the last two decades however, worsening weather conditions have also raised concerns with regards to the effects of climate change, which has markedly complicated food production even in countries with some high-quality street foods in the world. According to a report by McKinsey, major food players like Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) have not overcome environmental challenges to any satisfactory degree. In fact, as of 2021, the global agri-food systems industry accounted for more than thirty percent of human-caused global greenhouse-gas emissions, making them an important focal point in addressing climate-related issues. The report then goes on to identify multiple avenues the food industry can opt for to meet climate targets whilst generating new revenue. One of these avenues is to minimize carbon via regenerative agricultural practices such as investing in cover crops. This could potentially make up for more than 1.2 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide out of the 6.0 to 10.0 GtCO2 of annual sequestration needed by 2050. This can also play a fundamental role in engaging with other serious sustainability concerns like biodiversity loss, nutrient pollution, and freshwater consumption.\n\nAccording to the report however, one thing most companies and stakeholders are overlooking is the fact that efficiently producing sustainable food is meaningless unless diets shift towards more sustainable sources of energy and protein globally, especially when it comes to high-quality street foods in the world. However, the report does note that such shifts are currently underway in most countries across the world. For instance, consumers across the world are capitalizing on the alternative-protein revolution whilst it is in its early phases as companies develop and scale plant-based proteins. This can be supplemented by integrating cultivated meats, plant-based meats, and other innovative practices to aid in meeting consumer demands sustainably. However, it is true that not all consumers will be open to plant-based proteins. Thus, major players in the industry will need to divert greater investments towards alternative-protein sources like cultured (lab-grown) meat. The cultured meat segment of the industry could make up more than $25 billion in value in the next five years. However, companies must understand that consumers tend to have extremely strong preferences as to what meat should look, taste, and feel like, which creates an uphill battle for lab-grown meat providers in meeting consumer expectations.

The United States boasts one of the most complex food-delivery markets in the world. As these markets continue to expand, a report by McKinsey highlights certain critical factors which will aid in determining the levels of success for different players in the space, one of them being geographic competition among platforms. According to the report, different platforms will continue to vie for customers, restaurants, and drivers in each individual market, potentially paving the way for further consolidation over the course of time. This competition may extend to newer verticals beyond restaurants like to some high-quality street foods in the world, and platforms continue to build upon their portfolios and broaden the scope of services they provide.\n\nAnother primary point of contention for most players is commission rates for restaurants. Food delivery platforms like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats tend to derive revenue from five key streams: restaurant commissions (about 30 percent of the price of a meal), customer delivery fees, customer-service fees (up to 15 percent on top of delivery fees), in-app advertising, and tips, with commission fees being one of the most competitive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several local governments in the United States imposed caps on these commissions. As these caps have slowly been lifted, restaurants are feeling increasingly constrained, especially since many food delivery platforms are now much more influential and important than they were pre-pandemic. The proliferation of dark kitchens and other delivery-only models are likely to put further pressure on the restaurants. Highest Quality Street Food in the World\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 30 high-quality street foods in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 foods which appeared most frequently during our research. Since the quality of food is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure quality of each street food; the criteria is premised on taste (20 points), popularity amongst locals (15 points), and hygiene (10 points). We then proceeded to award each food a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 30 street foods which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the taste of each street food and popularity amongst locals.\n\nTo sum it up, we ranked the 30 high-quality street foods in the world using a consensus methodology. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best mid-cap dividend aristocrats to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of mid-cap stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy.\n\nInvestors commonly ignore mid-cap stocks due to their perceived higher volatility compared to large-cap equities. However, this notion isn't entirely accurate. According to findings from Jensen Investment Management, high-quality mid-cap companies have shown resilience over the past decade, often keeping pace with or even outperforming the broader S&P 500 index. For instance, while quality mid-caps experienced a 10.6% decline in 2022, the S&P 500 suffered a greater loss of 18.1%. The report also mentioned that across various timeframes spanning three, five, and ten years ending in 2022, the performance outcomes have displayed mixed results. Quality mid-cap stocks consistently demonstrated comparable performance, delivering positive returns of 7.8%, 9.6%, and 12.2%, respectively. These figures stand in comparison to the returns of the S&P 500, which stood at 7.7%, 9.4%, and 12.6% over the same periods.\n\nVarious reports have shed light on the positive performance of mid-cap stocks. The S&P MidCap 400, which tracks the performance of 400 mid-sized companies, has surpassed the broader market and the S&P SmallCap 600 by 2.03% and 0.94% annually, respectively, from 1994 to 2019, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Another research by ProShares revealed the dividend factor of mid-cap stocks. The S&P MidCap Dividend Aristocrats Index includes a select group of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 15 consecutive years or more. Since its inception in 2015, this index has consistently outpaced the broader S&P MidCap 400, achieving an annualized outperformance of 177 basis points while exhibiting lower levels of volatility. These mid-cap Dividend Aristocrats have demonstrated resilience in navigating market fluctuations over time. They have managed to capture most of the market's upswings during bull markets while significantly mitigating losses during bear markets, which proves to be a valuable characteristic, especially in times of uncertainty. The report further mentioned that mid-cap dividend growers experienced distribution growth at an annualized rate surpassing 12% since 2015. This growth rate exceeded that of large-cap companies and recent inflation levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne general misperception of mid-cap stocks is that these companies reinvest a significant portion of their earnings to fund expansion, research and development, and other growth initiatives. However, according to analysts, investors might be missing out on some opportunities by doing so. Especially when these companies offer dividends, investors are advised to take a leap of faith and invest in small- and mid-cap (SMID) dividend payers. Sarah Radecki, CFA, equity portfolio manager at Principal Asset Management, spoke with the Wall Street Journal about the investment potential these companies offer. Here are some comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cSMID dividend stocks provide an attractive tradeoff between risk and return, with the potential for relatively high total return, low volatility, and predictable growth of income. You may be able to secure an income stream from a smaller stock with the potential to grow over time, without paying sky-high prices.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal report highlighted the strong performance shown by SMID dividend companies. These dividend stocks have delivered an annual return of 15.68% from 1975 to June 2023, surpassing both large-cap dividend-paying stocks and the overall stock market. Additionally, their volatility is approximately 15% lower than the average SMID stock. Moreover, these differences become even more significant among SMID stocks that consistently increase their dividend payouts. Over the last 35 years, these dividend-growing stocks have achieved more attractive annualized gains while exhibiting lower risk compared to the average SMID dividend payer.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent large-cap dividend aristocrat stocks to buy with decades of dividend growth streaks under their belt. However, in this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks from the mid-cap space. 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy\n\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned the holdings of S&P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of mid-sized companies within the S&P MidCap 400 index that have maintained a consistent track record of increasing dividends annually for at least 15 years.

        "content": "Campbell Soup (CPB) can now officially look to pasta sauce to stir up investor interest.\n\nThe king of chicken noodle soup officially completed its $2.7 billion deal for Rao's pasta sauce maker Sovos Brands on Tuesday. Announced in August 2023, the deal also includes frozen food label Michael Angelo's and yogurt brand Noosa.\n\nSovos will be renamed Distinctive Brands, which will sit inside of Campbell Soup.\n\n\"This is fundamentally a profound transformation of an iconic company,\" Campbell Soup CEO Mark Clouse said on Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nThe Sovos deal marks Campbell's largest acquisition since former CEO Denise Morrison plunked down $4.87 billion to buy pretzel leader Snyder's-Lance in 2018. It's the first major deal for Clouse as the head of Campbell Soup, a position he has held since early 2019.\n\nRao's parent company, which went public in 2021, will join a sauce portfolio that includes lower-priced Prego pasta sauce and Swanson broths. Sovos posted $1 billion in sales last year, up 25% year over year.\n\nThe Rao's brand hauled in $775 million in sales alone, up 37% from a year ago.\n\nCampbell's share price has been down 19% in the past year compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 34% gain. Clouse sees the stock warming up, in large part due to Sovos's potential, though he declined to speculate on whether the Street is badly misunderstanding the promise of their new acquisition. Cans of Campbell soup are displayed along a grocery store's shelves on Aug. 7, 2023, in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nFirst, Campbell sees the potential for $50 million in cost savings over the next two years.\n\nSecond, Clouse has floated the idea of selling Noosa as he views it as \"non-core.\"\n\nAnd lastly, Rao's is expected to enter new product categories (think frozen desserts) soon to tap into the popularity of its pasta sauce. Those product lines and overall growth plan could be unveiled at the company's investor day in June.\n\n\"We expect the acquisition to be nicely accretive to Campbell's organic revenue, adding over 1ppt. to the overall company,\" said Stifel analyst Matthew Smith in a note to clients.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We expect Campbell to highlight [at its investor day] the enhanced growth profile of the business inclusive of Sovos Brands and provide more details regarding the growth and margin potential of the Snacking division.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 most reliable dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nDuring times of economic turmoil, investors often shift their attention toward dividend stocks, which provide regular income streams. The reliability of these stocks depends on factors such as their historical growth performance, cash flow stability, payout ratios, and overall financial health reflected in their balance sheets. Among these, dividend growth emerges as the most important factor when considering investing in dividend stocks. Moreover, historical returns have shown the outperformance of dividend growth strategies over an average dividend stock. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, outperformed the broader market with lower volatility over the long run. The report also mentioned that the index demonstrates its capacity to offer downside protection through its upside and downside capture ratios. The index surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time.\n\nDividend stocks that offer both a substantial yield and a track record of consistent dividend growth strike a balance between distributing dividends to shareholders and reinvesting capital into future growth endeavors. Nuveen reported FactSet data which showed that dividends per share rose by 5% in the S&P 500, and it is anticipated that there will be similar growth in 2024 based on consensus estimates. In addition to this, over 325 companies within the index either raised their dividends per share or introduced a dividend over the past year.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the payout ratio holds a significant importance when assessing the dependability of dividend stocks. Companies with high payout ratios may face challenges in future growth, which could jeopardize both stock price appreciation and dividend growth. Fortunately, the S&P 500\u2019s dividend payout ratio remains below its long-term average. Consensus estimates also indicate an 11% growth in earnings per share for 2024, which should support attractive returns for shareholders. Moreover, companies are maintaining substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets, with cash totaling roughly $2 trillion as of September 2023, nearing the highest levels in two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough dividend stocks didn\u2019t perform as well as the broader market in 2024, analysts have given a positive stance about dividend equities this year. Goldman Sachs has raised its forecast for dividend payouts in the S&P 500. The firm stated that there has been a surge in investors' attraction towards dividend-paying stocks following Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s recent announcement of its inaugural quarterly dividend. The firm\u2019s analysts noted this heightened interest and consequently revised their forecast for the S&P 500's dividend-per-share payout, increasing it from 4% to 6%. Another reason contributing to the optimism regarding dividends among Goldman's team is the trend of major US corporations consistently exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations during the last quarter of 2023. Considering investors\u2019 inclination toward dividend stocks, companies are steadily increasing their payouts. Goldman reported that since the beginning of 2024, 56 companies within the S&P 500 index have increased their dividends, with a median increase of 6%. Among these, financial firms and industrial companies, totaling 10 and nine respectively, have played a significant role in driving the overall increase.\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks that have raised their dividends for decades and have strong balance sheets include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). In this article, we will further take a look at reliable dividend stocks. 12 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nDaily newspaper economy stock market chart\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this article, we used a stock screener to identify dividend stocks that have raised their payouts for at least 15 consecutive years and had payout ratios of below 35% in 2023.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 dividend kings to invest in for safe dividend growth. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend growth stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth.\n\nDividend stocks are investors\u2019 favorites, particularly ones that demonstrate a capacity to raise their dividend payments over an extended period. Dividend kings stand out in this regard as these companies have increased their payouts for 50 consecutive years or more. This indicates that numerous companies are inclined to regularly increase their dividends due to investors' preferences. One of the main reasons for this growth is the strong cash position of many high-quality companies. As reported by Harvard Business Review, non-banking U.S. companies have substantially boosted their cash reserves, reaching a staggering $6.9 trillion, exceeding the GDP of nearly all countries worldwide. Despite rising interest rates, cash holdings now constitute a significant portion, with $1 out of every $5 in total assets held by non-banking U.S. firms.\n\nWhen investing in dividend stocks, investors are often faced with the dilemma of dividend yields and dividend growth. Analysts advise not to fall for yield traps and consider stocks that offer yields between 3% to 4%. Yields above this range may sometimes signal that the dividend payout is unsustainable or that the company is facing challenges. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, spoke with CNBC about ideal dividend yields and their significance. He suggested focusing on excellent businesses that could offer a dividend yield of around 3% to 4%. He explained that these companies tend to increase their dividend payments consistently, which helps increase yearly income and counteract the impact of inflation. Here are some other comments from the analyst:\n\n\u201cWhen stock prices fall, it\u2019s so easy to panic, but dividend investing can overcome that because you\u2019re just trying to stay focused on your income stream. You don\u2019t care so much about the market\u2019s short-term ups and downs anymore.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nS&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has shown strong returns over the years, outperforming other asset classes despite market conditions. A ProShares report has presented a rather interesting take on investing in the index, particularly for income investors. The report mentioned that the index has consistently surpassed the performance of the S&P 500 while experiencing reduced levels of market volatility since its inception. This could mean that an initial investment of $10,000 made in May 2005 could potentially grow to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report further mentioned that the Dividend Aristocrats Index has demonstrated superior performance compared to the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten most significant quarterly downturns since 2005.\n\nIn 2023, dividend stocks encountered a phase of weaker performance due to a notable rise in yields, largely driven by the Federal Reserve's successive interest rate hikes. Nonetheless, expectations suggest a change in the outlook for income investing in 2024. Analysts at Lord Abbett predict that as the economy slows down, companies with solid balance sheets, good cash flow, and durable dividends will do better. Some of the best dividend kings include The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). These companies have a long-standing history of consistently increasing their dividends over many years.

        "content": "Monday, March 10, 2024\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) and HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+5.4% vs. +4.9%). The company being a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient integrated capital structure and a track record of prudent CAPEX management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.\r\n\r\nWith a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and a strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. XOM reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings due to increased liquids production.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenges loom, notably in upstream operations susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles like the $2B impairment in California. While committed to shareholders, XOM faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in dividend yield and enduring financial strain from low-return investments and pandemic impacts.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of PepsiCo have underperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (-2.1% vs. +7.4%). The company banks on strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends.\r\n\r\nThese factors along with robust pricing aided PepsiCo\u2019s earnings and organic revenues fourth-quarter 2023. The company witnessed organic revenue growth across the global beverage and convenient food businesses. Additionally, the company\u2019s productivity and cost-management initiatives bode well. For 2024, PEP expects to deliver organic revenues revenue growth of at least 4%.\r\n\r\nHowever, PepsiCo witnessed soft volume trends across both businesses, which impacted reported revenues in the fourth quarter. Adverse currency rates also remain headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on PepsiCo here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of HSBC have gained +16.0% over the past year against the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry\u2019s gain of +27.7%. The company\u2019s strong capital position, higher interest rates, an extensive network and business restructuring initiatives will keep supporting HSBC. The company is winding down its retail operations in Canada and is in the process of fully exiting Russia (gets Russia unit sale approval).\r\n\r\nIn order to focus more on Asia, the company is set to acquire Citigroup\u2019s wealth business in China. However, HSBC\u2019s fourth-quarter 2023 results were hurt by lower revenues. While its efforts to improve market share in the Asia region will aid financials in the long run, it might lead to a rise in near-term costs.\r\n\r\nBecause of its growth strategy and higher technology-related expenses, HSBC expects 2024 expense growth of 5%. The current tough macroeconomic backdrop is another near-term headwind.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on HSBC here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (CRWD) and Vulcan Materials Company (VMC).\r\n\r\nDirector of Research\r\n\r\nSheraz Mian\r\n\r\nNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "title": "15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 15 best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. You can skip our detailed analysis of NASDAQ stocks and the performance of dividend stocks over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy.\n\nThe NASDAQ, which primarily consists of technology-related stocks, has been experiencing upward momentum since the previous year. In 2023, it saw remarkable growth, achieving its strongest performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. As of March 7, it has gained 10.21%, surpassing the broader market's gain of 8.72% this year so far. Notably, according to Jonathan Krinsky, a leading market analyst at BTIG, the NASDAQ-100, which is heavily concentrated in tech, has endured 303 consecutive trading sessions without experiencing a decline of 2.5% or more as of March 5, marking it as the third-longest period without such a significant pullback since 1990. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are some of the best dividend stocks listed on the index.\n\nThe impressive performance of NASDAQ can be largely attributed to the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has driven up the prices of major technology stocks and boosted the overall market throughout 2023 and into the current year. Additionally, the easing of inflation and the Federal Reserve's indication of potential rate cuts later in 2024 have further supported NASDAQ's rebound from the challenges it faced in 2022. Despite the prevalence of technology companies in the NASDAQ index, many companies offer dividends to shareholders. A notable recent addition to the list of dividend-paying companies in the index is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which made headlines in February of this year by declaring its inaugural dividend. This move marks a significant milestone for the technology sector, which has long been dominated by a select few companies for more than a decade.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's decision to offer a dividend serves as evidence that investors are increasingly interested in dividend-paying stocks for their capacity to provide consistent and reliable income. This trend was evident in 2023 when companies in the US distributed record dividends to their shareholders. According to a report by Janus Henderson, the S&P 500 paid out an all-time high of $70.30 per share last year, a notable increase from $66.92 in 2022. This resulted in a total payment to shareholders reaching a record $588.2 billion, surpassing the previous year's figure of $564.6 billion. The report also mentioned that there were 707 instances of dividend increases reported in the fourth quarter of 2023. These increases amounted to a total of $17.5 billion for the quarter, showing an uptick from the $16.3 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFurthermore, dividend-paying stocks have historically delivered robust returns. Since 1960, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of the market's total return. Dividend stocks offer a degree of stability during periods of increased market volatility. According to a report by Perkins Coie, a Washington-based law firm, dividend-paying stocks exhibit 30%-33% lower volatility compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. This stability has been particularly notable during turbulent decades like the 1930s and 2000s, where dividend-paying stocks served as a buffer against significant declines in market prices. In addition to this, dividend-paying companies that consistently increase their dividends can provide better protection against inflation than bonds in an inflationary environment.\n\nIn view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks listed on NASDAQ. 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy\n\nPhoto by nick chong on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 933 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders.

        "title": "Shorting the Shorts: 3 Stocks Primed for an Epic Squeeze",
        "content": "Danish researchers published a report on the arXiv.org open-access archive for scholarly articles in February about the Jan. 2021 short squeeze of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). The researchers found that the subreddit community WallStreetBets 's(WSB) desire to find and invest in stocks primed for short squeeze had a role in GME\u2019s short squeeze from more than three years ago.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe estimated that the size of the total position of WSB users amounted to at least 1% of GME market capitalization, demonstrating a tangible engagement of the WSB community in the stock market\u201d the report\u2019s conclusion stated.\u00a0\n\nThere is no question that the WSB community affected GameStop\u2019s massive short squeeze, which saw GME stock go from less than $5 to over $80 in three weeks. While WSB's influence isn\u2019t nearly as strong as it once was, Reddit is set to go public in mere days, a sign that it\u2019s become part of the investment community\u2019s inner circle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMaybe there won\u2019t be another one like GME\u2019s, but just in case, here are three stocks primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\n\nMGP Ingredients (MGPI)\n\nMGP Ingredients (NASDAQ:MGPI) used to produce distilled spirits for other brands. In April 2021, it diversified into its own brands when it acquired Luxco, a maker of bourbon brands such as Rebel Yell, for $475 million. The acquisition was part of the company\u2019s growth stategy focused on producing higher-value products.\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, its Luxco division acquired Penelope Bourbon for $105 million plus potential payouts of $111 million based on meeting specific performance targets.\n\nPenelope was already being distilled at MGP\u2019s Lawrenceburg, Indiana distillery, so the acquisition makes sense. Penelope sells 50,000 cases annually, growing by more than 160% year-over-year.\u00a0\n\nNot everyone believes MGP\u2019s premiumization strategy is a good idea. As of Feb. 15, it had 3.28 million shares short, accounting for 23.73% of its float. The company reported full-year results on Feb. 22.\u00a0\n\nThe move into higher-value products increased its gross margin by 610 basis points in 2023 to 42.5%. The company's adjusted operating income increased 21% in 2023 to $180.3 million, a 21.6% operating margin, 260 basis points higher than a year ago.\u00a0\n\nMGPI stock is primed for a short squeeze.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEncore Wire (WIRE)\n\nEncore Wire (NYSE:WIRE) is a Texas-based manufacturer of copper and aluminum building wire used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. The company started in 1989, going public three years later, in July 1992, around $3 a share.\u00a0\n\nI first recommended Encore in December 2022, along with six other small-cap stocks. My sentiment was the same then, as it is now, that it would continue to capture market share. Encore's shares are up 59% in the 15 months since, 29% better than the S&amp;P 500.\n\nEncore had a down year this past year due to a 17.8% decrease in the average selling price of copper wire in 2023, partly offset by a 6.7% increase in pounds of copper shipped. As a result of the nearly 15% decline in revenue in 2023 to $2.57 billion, Encore's gross profit margin fell 11.4 percentage points to 25.5% from 36.9% a year earlier.\u00a0\n\nPrices are a part of the business it can\u2019t control. However, It can control its balance sheet. As of Dec. 31, Encore had no outstanding long-term debt and $560.6 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. That was down from 2022 but still represented a high 16% of its market capitalization.\u00a0\n\nAs of Feb. 15, it had 3.36 million shares short, accounting for 22.87% of its float.\u00a0\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH)\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is having a down year by its standards, up 61% in 2024. Over the past five years, it\u2019s gained a whopping 5,387%. It is the modern version of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m unsure why investors would short Celsius, given that PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is in its corner. In Aug. 2022, PepsiCo invested $550 million in Celsius convertible preferred shares, which pay a 5% annual dividend and are convertible into 8.5% of the company\u2019s common stock at $75 a share, solidifying its role as the U.S. distributor.\u00a0\n\nOn Jan. 22, Celsius announced expansion into Canada through Pepsi\u2014I\u2019ve seen it prominently placed in my local grocery store\u2014and the UK and Ireland through Suntory Beverage &amp; Food.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, Celsius\u2019s revenues were $1.32 billion, 102% higher than a year earlier. North American revenues were up 105%, while international revenues saw a 52% boost. Celsius's gross margin also increased 660 basis points YOY to 48.0%.\u00a0\n\nIts adjusted EBITDA jumped 316% to $295.6 million, an EBITDA margin of 22.4%. In comparison, Monster Beverage\u2019s EBITDA margin in 2023 was 28.5%, 610 basis points higher. However, Monster\u2019s margin is barely growing, while Celsius has plenty of room to grow its margin over the next several years.\u00a0\n\nCelsius has 36.31 million shares sold short, accounting for 22.81% of its float. Of the three names covered here, CELH would be my least likely to short.",

        "title": "AI could be critical to feeding a growing global population\u2014and Big Food is taking notice",
        "content": "Nearly three years ago, when Unilever developed a zero-salt bouillon cube for the company\u2019s Knorr brand, it had to design a new formulation without a key ingredient that is a massive contributor to taste and gives critical structure to the dehydrated broth.\n\nTo predict the best combination and concentration of ingredients for the new stock cubes sans salt, Unilever leaned on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cCreating a zero-salt bouillon cube that will still have an acceptable taste for consumers is where predictive modeling has been super, super helpful,\u201d says Carla Hilhorst, chief research and development officer for Unilever\u2019s nutrition business. AI helped design the formulation of the zero-salt bouillon cube, as well as the way it would be produced on the company\u2019s manufacturing line.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest food companies for decades have leaned on AI, and in recent years they have been accelerating their embrace of the technology, including newer use cases for generative AI. \u201cCPG [consumer packaged goods] and retail have been using AI to do a host of things, including the ability to better predict demand,\u201d says Michelle McGuire Christian, chief commercial officer of ConvergeConsumer, a collaborative initiative between Deloitte and Google Cloud. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using it to optimize the supply chain for a long time,\u201d she added, including the merchandising and placement of products within a store.\n\nUnilever\u2019s AI models are used to help predict taste, consumer preferences, and microbiological stability, as well as determine if a product can run on a factory line. By using AI, the time needed for product development can go from months to just a few days. \u201cThe data-enabled decision-making allows you to find more of the sweet spot,\u201d says Hilhorst. \u201cYou can be more precise.\u201d\n\nOther AI innovations include Hellmann\u2019s vegan mayo, for which Unilever used advanced modeling to predict the taste, texture, and stability of a product that would omit egg. AI has helped lessen Unilever\u2019s food waste. For Hellmann\u2019s squeeze bottles, a thin layer of oil coating was added to the interior of the package so that only one to two servings of mayo would remain in the container, versus an average of around five before AI formulation predictive models were utilized.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI also helped Unilever pivot after Russia invaded Ukraine and the company had to quickly configure alternative formulations for ingredients that became difficult to procure, including sunflower oil.\n\nAthina Kanioura, PepsiCo\u2019s chief strategy and transformation officer, says the snacking giant has used more \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of AI for years, ranging in use from innovation, to planning with suppliers, to the optimal routes drivers should take when delivering products. The company is also starting to test generative AI for several parts of PepsiCo\u2019s business, including software development, handling queries to call centers, and food formulations.\n\nPepsiCo has developed internal standards to ensure everyone who uses AI does so safely. \u201cWe have the infrastructure that sits in our environment where we can give access to the sandbox of AI for people to test the different capabilities,\u201d says Kanioura.\n\nAnd with the world of snacking constantly evolving, PepsiCo says AI can help synthesize what consumers want at a faster pace, while also solving the best path forward to develop those foods and beverages across the supply chain. At the heart of those flavor development decisions, PepsiCo stresses, are human insights. \u201cThe next big thing didn\u2019t come from the tech, it came from the consumers,\u201d says Kanioura.\n\nPepsiCo says the company\u2019s AI efforts are focused on efficiency and growth, not expenses. \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush to drive cost optimization from gen AI,\u201d says Kanioura.\n\n\u201cAI is going to help us get the levels of accuracy and speed that we haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d says Anton Vincent, president of Mars Wrigley North America. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that as we start to think about taking complexity out, AI is going to be a big driver for us.\u201d\n\nThe candymaker says it has used AI for several years to help with sourcing, manufacturing, and digesting industry data to determine trends in the food industry. As for large language models, Vincent says, \u201cwe are trying to use it to drive productivity across all parts of our value chain. We\u2019re early days in that.\u201d\n\nTo move that journey along, Mars is opening an AI lab in the first quarter of 2024 at the company\u2019s Newark corporate office. \u201cThe AI lab offers the opportunity for every associate to walk in with an idea and hopefully walk out with a plan of action,\u201d says Gabrielle Wesley, chief marketing officer for Mars Wrigley North America.\n\nMarie Wright, chief global flavorist at food processing company ADM, recalls a time when flavorists wrote down formulas in \u201cbeautiful\u201d books, which would form the basis of the flavors that were produced in factories. But the movement to computers, and more recently AI, has changed how the industry handles formulations and data.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been such great strides in the past number of years on the AI platform,\u201d says Wright. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s like, how do we apply that to a creative skill such as creating flavors?\u201d She acknowledges that \u201cmany flavorists are afraid of AI. And I would say most creative people are afraid of AI.\u201d\n\nADM says it uses AI not to take away the work of flavor development, but to improve the process. Wright says it is critical that the technology group doesn\u2019t just mandate AI tools to be used. Instead, flavorists should be encouraged to be part of the AI journey.\n\n\u201cAI has to come into play because we as humans can\u2019t process that data,\u201d says Wright. \u201cAI has the big advantage of being able to process that data quickly to learn from and then ultimately start doing that machine learning and then hopefully be able to do more predictive things in terms of new formulas, new ways of working, and maybe in my estimation, we should become better at creativity.\u201d\n\nBayer says it has been a fairly early adopter of AI tools like machine learning. Take the example of corn: Before plant breeding, roughly 20 to 30 bushels were grown on an acre of land. Today, the average corn yield is 175 bushels. Part of those gains were from how farms evolved their fertilizer and agronomic practices, but a big chunk was through genetic improvements thanks to AI.\n\nAI helps Bayer crunch the data to determine the best parent candidates that a breeder can cross to create corn offspring that\u2019s the most successful in the field. There are billions of combinations possible for the genes in corn that are responsible for yield.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that the human mind wasn\u2019t capable of ingesting all the massive amounts of data we are now collecting and making enough sense of it,\u201d says Bob Reiter, head of global research and development for crop science at Bayer. \u201cIt\u2019s huge to break through and be able to unlock more of that genetic potential than we ever could have in the past without AI tools.\u201d\n\nThe predictive algorithms on which parents to cross and which genetic combinations to create have become so sophisticated that Bayer can undergo the process three to four times a year versus every few years before AI. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be in the future a big accelerator of continuing to increase that productivity for the farmer on that acre that they\u2019re planting,\u201d says Reiter.\n\nAnd with the world\u2019s population projected to reach 8.5 billion in 2030 and increase to 9.7 billion in 2050, farmers have to increasingly become more efficient.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s foundational to helping feed a growing global population,\u201d says Reiter.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best dividend stocks for rising interest rates. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance in the rising interest rate environments, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks for Rising Interest Rates.\n\nThe increase in interest rates, which started in 2022, came about due to the resurgence of inflation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of the cost of living, rose significantly to 9.1% for the year ending June 2022. In response to this persistent inflation, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate a total of 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023. During this time frame, interest rates in the wider bond market also experienced an increase, resulting in higher borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses. This measure was aimed at restraining economic expansion and job creation as a means to alleviate the inflationary pressure. As of January 2024, inflation over the preceding 12 months had moderated to 3.1%, although it remained above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. Following their December 2023 meeting, the Fed projected three quarter-point reductions by the close of 2024, aiming to bring the benchmark rate down to 4.6%.\n\nIncreased interest rates frequently cause shifts in market dynamics, creating distinct opportunities for growth and profitability in certain industries. For instance, sectors such as banking may thrive, while real estate and utilities could face challenges due to their dependence on borrowing. Although increasing interest rates present difficulties, particularly in sectors sensitive to interest, investing in stocks for the long term presents advantages such as compounded growth, decreased volatility, and potential tax advantages. Long-term investing helps in managing volatility since short-term fluctuations in stock prices tend to average out over extended periods, resulting in more stable returns. Additionally, stocks typically increase in value over time, benefiting long-term investors. Moreover, many stocks offer dividends, furnishing a consistent income stream that can be reinvested to foster additional growth. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the best dividend stocks because of their decades-long dividend growth histories.\n\nStory continues\n\nA study conducted by Global X revealed that since 1960, there have been 10 significant periods of interest rate increases. These periods are characterized by a rise in the yield of 10-year US Treasuries by more than 100 basis points over a span of 10 months or longer. The report focused on the performance of high-dividend stocks during these phases. It was found that high-dividend stocks consistently outperformed the market by an average annualized rate of 0.80% during rising interest rate periods. Specifically, high dividend stocks surpassed the market's performance in 7 out of the 10 observed periods of rising interest rates. The report also noted that high-dividend stocks are commonly included in investment portfolios to provide income for investors. Historically, these stocks have shown a tendency to outperform the S&P 500 index.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks for rising interest rates. 13 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates\n\nA close-up of a chart of company stock prices rising, reflecting its market capitalization.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we selected dividend stocks from sectors that either remain resilient or benefit in a rising interest rate environment.

        "content": "In a recent push to adapt to changing consumer habits and economic pressures, major food conglomerates WK Kellogg Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are reimagining dinner plates across the nation. With grocery prices surging by 25% over the past four years, these companies suggest that traditional dinner options could take a backseat to more unconventional choices like Frosted Flakes and Dorito casseroles.\n\nWK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick, highlighted cereal as an economical and versatile dinner option in a CNBC interview, stating, \"The cereal category is a great place for consumers under pressure. We\u2019re advertising about cereal for dinner. Think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do.\"\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American has $65,100 in their savings account \u2014 How do you compare? Are you rich? Here\u2019s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\n\nSimilarly, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta encouraged consumers at a Florida industry conference to explore creative culinary uses for snacks like Doritos and Rold Gold pretzels, suggesting they can serve as \"side dishes and ingredients\" in meals. According to Bloomberg, during the presentation, a slide was shown displaying an image of open bags of Doritos and Tostitos covered in cheese and peppers.\n\nThis pivot comes amid declining sales for snack products, as inflation continues to affect consumer purchasing power. For instance, PepsiCo's fourth-quarter report showed a revenue drop, including a 2% decline in volume for Frito-Lay North America. Kellogg's fourth-quarter sales also dipped, with a 10% volume drop, despite price increases.\n\nThe companies' innovative approach to mealtime is not new. Kellogg previously promoted \"#KelloggsCerealforDinnerEntry\" on Instagram, awarding $5,000 to entrants who shared their cereal-for-dinner moments. PepsiCo has sought to engage Gen Z, a demographic increasingly distant from sodas in favor of healthier options, with initiatives like Doritos-flavored cocktails and the introduction of Starry, a new soda aimed at this younger audience.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: This startup coined \u201ceBay for gamers\u201d with a breaktaking track record has opened up a window to invest in its future growth.\n\nExperts and industry observers note that these strategies emerge during a period of financial stress for many consumers. Inflation has outpaced wage growth, and food prices have risen significantly, impacting purchasing behaviors, especially among cost-conscious Gen Z consumers. A survey by the Private Label Manufacturers Association found that nearly two-thirds of Gen Z shoppers frequently opt for store brands over name brands, seeking to stretch their budgets further.\n\nCritics, however, point to \"greedflation\" as a factor in ongoing price increases, suggesting that companies are leveraging inflation as a pretext to boost profits. Braden Douglas, CEO of Crew Marketing Partners, suggests that the entire food supply chain is under pressure, not just manufacturers. He argues for a multifaceted approach to address high food prices, including potential government intervention and corporate efforts to absorb some costs.\n\nKellogg\u2019s and PepsiCo's calls for creativity in the kitchen reflect broader shifts in consumer habits, economic pressures and the ongoing search for affordable, convenient dining options. Whether these initiatives will lead to lasting changes in how people view dinner remains to be seen, but for now, they offer a glimpse into the evolving relationship between food companies and the consumers they serve.\n\nFor people seeking alternatives to resorting to chips and cereal for dinner because of financial constraints, consulting with a financial adviser could be a beneficial step. A financial adviser can help you get back on track by offering strategies to invest in your future, create a sustainable budget and make informed decisions that stretch your grocery dollars further while maintaining a balanced diet.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio.

        "title": "Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise",
        "content": "Celsius Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) has emerged as one of the U.S. stock market's top performers over the past decade. Its share price has soared from 26 cents in February 2014 to $64.50 at the time of writing, generating an impressive return of nearly 21,910% or an annualized compounded return of 72.3% over the last 10 years.\n\nDespite the recent rapid increase in its share price, I maintain an optimistic outlook for Celsius' long-term potential upside. This optimism is based on the company's high growth potential and its ability to improve its operating profitability going forward.\n\nBusiness overview\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CELH.\n\nCelsius is the manufacturer and distributor of functional energy drinks and protein bars. Its flagship product, CELSIUS, an energy drink that provides energy while burning calories and body fat. The company's products are distributed through various channels, including convenience stores, mass market, fitness and e-commerce. Celsius ranks as the third-largest player in the U.S. energy drink market, holding a 5.90% market share. It follows Red Bull and Monster (NASDAQ:MNST), which hold market shares of 39.50% and 29.70%. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nSource: Statista\n\nCelsius derives its revenue from three main customers. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is the largest one, accounting for 22% of the total revenue in 2022. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) ranked second, representing 16.7% of total sales. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stood in third place with 8.80% of the revenue. These leading customers are main distributors of Celsius' products, giving consumers considerable confidence in the brand.\n\nNotably, PepsiCo has become the primary distributor for Celsius products in the U.S since August 2022. It also invested $550 million in Celsius' convertible preferred stock, further strengthening the bond between the two companies. I consider the agreement with PepsiCo as a game changer. As PepsiCo is the globally recognized brand with world-wide distribution channels, the deal with PepsiCo opens the door for Celsius to unlimited growth opportunities in both U.S. and international markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuperb revenue growth with dismal operating profitability\n\nCelsius has managed to grow its revenue every single year for the past 10 years. Remarkably, its revenue soared 85-fold, climbing from $7.68 million in 2012 to $653.60 million in 2022. This growth translates to an impressive annual compounded growth rate of 56%. Despite this substantial revenue growth, the company recorded operating losses in nine out of the last 10 years. The only profitable year was 2020, where it posted operating profits of $7.83 million. In 2022, its operating income plummeted to a loss of nearly $158 million. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe significant operating losses in 2022 can be attributed to a substantial rise in selling and marketing expenses. While revenue more than doubled from $314.30 million in 2021 to $653.60 million in 2022, selling and marketing expenses surged nearly fivefold from $74 million to $353 million in just one year.\n\nA closer examination reveals the selling and marketing expenses for 2022 included $194 million in termination fees paid to previous distributors as part of transitioning to Pepsi to become its primary distributor in the U.S. This expense is one-time, not recurring. After adjusting for these termination expenses, the adjusted selling and marketing costs would be $159 million only.\n\nIt is positive that Celsius has achieved significant operating profits during the first nine months of 2023. During this period, the company reported revenue of $970.60 million and operating profits of $207.40 million, resulting in a substantial operating margin of 21.40%.\n\nDebt-free balance sheet\n\nCelsius has a debt-free balance sheet. As of September, the company holds $760 million in cash and has a shareholders' equity of $213.40 million, with no interest-bearing debt at all. This strong financial position allows Celsius significant flexibility to invest in future growth and expand into international markets. However, maintaining a debt-free balance sheet has come at a cost, specifically in the form of an increasing share count, which leads to the dilution of shareholders' equity. The total number of diluted shares has increased from 60.55 million in 2012 to nearly 227 million in 2022. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nPotential upside\n\nFrom 2018 to mid-2020, the company's enterprise value-to-revenue ratio consistently remained lower than its larger competitor, Monster Beverage. However, since August 2020, its sales multiples has risen rapidly. At the time of writing, Celsius is trading at 12.40 times its sales, while Monster Beverage is trading at 8 times revenue. Celsius Holdings Has Upside Potential Following Meteoric Share Price Rise\n\nThe higher valuation of Celsius can be justified by its significantly higher revenue growth compared to Monster Beverage. Since 2020, Celsius has experienced annual revenue growth ranging from 50% to 130%, much higher than Monster Beverage's, which experienced sales increase in the range of only 12% to 20%.\n\nAssuming Celsius maintains its historical revenue growth rate of 56% over the next five years, its revenue is projected to reach $12 billion by 2028. If Celsius' operating margin stays at 21%, its operating earnings will be $2.52 billion in 2028. With an earnings multiple of 30, Celsius' enterprise value will be $75.6 billion by 2028. Using a 10% discount rate, the estimated value of Celsius stands at $47 billion. Assuming the company issues 50% more shares over the next five years to fund for its business expansion and acquisitions, the total diluted share count is expected to reach 340 million. Thus, Celsius should be worth $138 per share, 114% higher than its current share price.\n\nConclusion\n\nCelsius Holdings showcases phenomenal business growth, evidenced by its substantial revenue growth and a strong, debt-free balance sheet, emphasizing its financial health. The company's strategic partnership with PepsiCo for the U.S. and international expansion highlights the business' immense potential. Combined with an improving operating margin, Celsius represents a compelling investment opportunity with solid fundamentals and substantial potential upside.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \r\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Paul Wiseman, Investors Relations for Celsius. Thank you may begin.\n\nPaul Wiseman\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are John Fieldly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jarrod Langhans, Chief Financial Officer. The call will open to questions following the prepared remarks.\r\nThe company released its fourth quarter earnings press release earlier this morning, and all materials are available on the company's website celsiusholdingsinc.com as well as on the SEC's website, sec.gov. As a reminder, an audio replay of this call will be available later today and can be accessed with the same live webcast link in our conference call announcement released. \r\nPlease be aware that this call may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management at this time.

Descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures that we use, such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and reconciliations of these measures to our results as reported in accordance with GAAP are detailed in our earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2023.\r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John Fieldly, for his prepared remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. Also welcome to Paul Wiseman, who recently joined Celsius as our Senior Vice President of Communications. Celsius had a stellar 2023 fourth quarter, the best earnings year in our company's history. We have achieved nearly complete distribution coverage in the United States, topping 98% ACV, which is a major achievement, putting our products in reach of more consumers and more consumption occasions with greater flavors and size options than ever before. In 2023, Celsius set a new yearly revenue record, growing more than 102% or $664 million in sales to finish the year at just over $1.3 billion. Celsius is now truly a $1 billion brand.\r\nOur impressive share gains in 2023 have resulted in Celsius becoming the first company to break the 10-share barrier in more than a decade. According to Circana, IRI's recent 4-week read ending February 11, 2024 in total energy U.S., Celsius held a new record of 11.5 share nationwide in MULOC. The energy drink category is now a 3-team race.\r\nAs of January 2024, Celsius had exceeded a 15 share in over a dozen U.S. markets and a few of those, we are within just a few points of our next closest competitor or have already taken them. Our strong innovation pipeline continues to delight consumers whose taste for zero sugar energy drinks has nearly tripled the overall category sales to a zero sugar majority. Although this year, we have launched 2 new core SKUs, Sparkling Raspberry Peach and Fizz-Free Blue Raspberry Lemonade. In addition, 2 new Celsius Vibe flavors, Astro Vibe and Galaxy Vibe, which has taken our Space Odyssey, truly even further with the launch of our Cosmic Vibe in 2023 in Circle K. \r\nCelsius also launched Celsius Essential's product line, which has proven essential performance energy with essential aminos. We are executing our plans to grow the business internationally, taking a methodical approach in each new market we enter. \r\nWe're very pleased with our sales in Canada after 2 months in the country. Consumer enthusiasm and acceptance has exceeded our expectations. We're pursuing disciplined growth in our best-in-class sales and marketing organizations. And just 2 weeks ago, Celsius was recognized with the 7-Eleven's prestigious 2023 Supplier of the Year award in a nonalcoholic category. This is a tremendous achievement. And I want to thank all our dedicated team members on achieving this great top industry award. Best-in-class teams drive best-in-class results. \r\nWith nearly full distribution, we are focusing on driving growth through 3 areas: increasing total distribution points at each location, growing in nontracked channels and international expansion over the long-term horizon. Celsius was again the top driver of the energy category in dollars and units sold in MULOC, ending in the fourth quarter, up 126.6% and up 140.2% for the full year of 2023, supporting a 30.6% of all the energy category growth for the year.\r\nAlready this year, we've launched several new and exciting innovations as well as a brand update to our line of Fizz-Free beverages, which have a strong and loyal consumer base. A new Fizz-Free multipack available now in Target stores brings together refreshing selection to our consumers who prefer the noncarbonated energy drinks.\r\nSales of Celsius Essentials, our new line of performance-oriented and energy, a 16-ounce beverage products launched in the fourth quarter at 7-Eleven stores across the United States and our 2 new flavors, Sparkling Mango Tango and Sparkling Fruit Burst bring the Celsius Essential line to 6 unique SKUs. As of January 2024, Celsius Essentials has achieved a record 40% ACV year-to-date, February 18th, it's at 49% ACV, continuing to see greater acceptance across retailers across the country. \r\nAlso in January, our Celsius on-the-go powder claimed the position in the energy powder category according to Circana's IRI commanding a 23.1 share, having increased 5.6% compared to the prior period. We have several new on-the-go powder innovations plan for this year and see great opportunities with our [virtual] on-the-go product line.\r\nIn 2024, spring resets began in January and typically run through May. We are very pleased with the incremental space we're gaining, which will be reflected across the first and second quarters of 2024. As a reminder, planograms used for most of 2023 when our dollar sales grew 140% were created while we were holding and held approximately 4.5 share in the category. For 2024, shelf space planning was conducted with retail partners in Q3 of 2023, when we held a digital -- double-digit share position. Celsius is also now fully integrated into PepsiCo's annual planning cycle, and we anticipate ongoing close collaboration with our primary North American distribution partner and expanded key accounts team.\r\nOur pursuit of a perfect store resulted in a 60% increase in display activity across the United States, and we placed more than over 10,000 Celsius branded coolers in 2023 and an increase of over 300% year-over-year. We intend to continue growing our base of branded coolers throughout this year. \r\nNontracked channels continue to be a tailwind for us as well. Club sales for the fourth quarter were $77.1 million, up 64% year-over-year. Club sales for the full year 2023 were $254.6 million, representing an $83.6 million increase year-over-year.\r\nWe achieved the #1 energy drink position on Amazon in 2023, finishing the full year revenue at $101 million, a 72.9% increase year-over-year. Our refreshing great tasting products are ideal for the meal occasion, and today, more than 12.5% of our PepsiCo sales is to the foodservice channel. For example, in 2023, we gained distribution in over 2,000 Jersey Mike stores and are authorized to sell in more than 3,000 Dunkin' Donut locations nationwide. We believe there is incremental growth opportunities for Celsius and nontracked outlets, such as vending, hospitals, corporate cafeterias and college campuses and more.\r\nTurning to international. We began distribution in sales in Canada through Pepsi in mid-January. As we had previously signaled, after approximately 1 month of sales, we are very pleased with the results and even more so to delight our Canadian consumers who have embraced our products.\r\nInternational sales reached $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $54.7 million for the full year. \r\nAlso in January, we announced a sales and distribution agreement with Suntory Beverage for Great Britain and Ireland. We expect sales in the United Kingdom to begin gradually starting in the Finnish channel in the second quarter. \r\nWe expect additional international expansion this year. And as previously stated, we're taking a methodical approach to our international growth, and we will be following our international growth playbook in each new market we enter.\r\nBefore I hand it over to Jarrod to discuss financial highlights for the quarter and the full year, we have several exciting marketing developments and achievements to be proud of. Celsius recently announced a renewed multiyear global team sponsorship with Formula One's iconic Ferrari racing team. Major League soccer kicked off its regular season last week, and Celsius is a proud league partner as well as key sponsor of multiple teams and players across the United States and Canada. These strategic investments placed our premium brand in the forefront of consumers who share our passion to live fit.\r\nWith that, I'll pass it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jarrod Langhans, to discuss our fourth quarter and 2023 full year financial results. Jarrod?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nThanks, John. It was another great quarter in which we continue to exceed both internal and external expectations. Not only are we continuing to benefit from Pepsi's distribution system, but we're also delivering on increased SKU count, improved placement, increased displays and continuous improvement within velocities. As we look to Q1 and beyond, we will continue to invest in our growth. \r\nTurning to our fourth quarter financial highlights. Revenue for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $347 million, an increase of 95% from $178 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Driven by our North American business, where fourth quarter revenues were $333 million, an increase of 97% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 68% to $15 million as velocity continued to increase. As it relates to days on hand with our primary distributor, our inventory turns relative to depletions was consistent with our Q3 2023 turnover.\r\nWe attribute our sales volume growth for the quarter compared to 2022 to several key drivers, including successful integration into the Pepsi distribution system, which has resulted in broader availability, increased SKU mix, and improved placement. We're also benefiting from robust expansion in our traditional distribution channels and club channels with SKU increases in placement improvements contributing significantly. Moreover, our products are now found in several new channels within CNG and foodservice.\r\nGross profit for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 110% to $166 million, up from $79 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 44% for the prior year fourth quarter. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to efficiencies in raw material sourcing product-based reduction and benefits from improved leverage across promotional allowances. Q4 was the fifth consecutive quarter that we were operating within the Pepsi distribution system, and we expect to continue driving efficiencies while maintaining our #1 goal of keeping the shelf stock to meet strong consumer demand.\r\nSales and marketing expenses for the quarter were approximately $80 million, a decrease of approximately 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to prior year costs associated with the termination of legacy distributors as part of the transition to the Pepsi network. \r\nWe continue to invest behind our growth in Q4, incurring sales and marketing costs in line with historical rates. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 23% compared to 29% in the prior year adjusted for distributor termination expenses in 2022. We plan to continue investment in our sales and marketing and plan a similar spend as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2024.\r\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $27 million, an increase of 24% relative to Q4 2022. As a percentage of sales, G&A was 8% compared to 12% in the prior year as we continue to leverage our G&A against our significant growth. And looking back at prior periods, even with our historical growth rates, we do tend to see some seasonality within the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We saw similar activities in the fourth quarter, whereby we are not able to capitalize on the great work from our sales and marketing teams as it relates to displays on hand and other promotional activities that we are able to take advantage of during the summer selling season. Even with this, we ended the year strong and have since well exceeded the 10 share marker as noted by John earlier in the call.\r\nLooking at the full year 2023. As you will see in the 10-K issued this morning, we made great progress in our remediation efforts around our internal control environment. We were successful in remediating the prior period controls associated with IT general controls as well as creating and delivering a much more robust [coastal] environment. Although we made huge strides in 2023, there are still a handful of areas where components of larger areas of the control environment needs some additional time to fully remediate.\r\nWith that said, I'd like to thank the entire Celsius team for the great effort and in particular, our finance and IT teams for their focus and dedication to this matter in 2023. I look forward to our continued progress in 2024. \r\nNow to the results. Revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $1.3 billion an increase of 102% from $654 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, driven by our North American business. North America full year 2023 revenues were $1.27 billion, an increase of 105% from the same period in 2022. International revenue grew 52% to $55 million in 2023 relative to full year 2022. \r\nGross profit for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, increased 134% to $633 million, up from $271 million in the prior year period. Gross profit margins in the full year of 2023 were approximately 48% of revenues compared to approximately 41% for the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit margins is attributed to lower package and raw material costs. \r\nAs things stand today, we would expect 2024 gross profit margins to be fairly consistent with the Q4 and full year margin profile, as we are confident in maintaining the great progress that was made in 2023. We are always shooting for the moon but with the uncertainty around the macro environment from both an operational and promotional perspective, we believe that it is prudent to give ourselves some additional time into 2024.\r\nAs a percentage of sales, sales and marketing was 20% in the 12 months of 2023 compared to 24% in the prior year same period, adjusted for distributor termination expenses. This demonstrated the leverage that we can obtain within our sales and marketing costs. \r\nWe made great progress in 2023, but we are now moving to the next level and the next target beyond 10% market share. And to do that, we will need to continue to invest in our growth and our brand, as seen with the multiple Super Bowl activations that we did in February, our recently announced multiyear partnership with Ferrari within Formula One as well as our multiyear MLS partnership.\r\nG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 8% for the 12 months of 2023 versus 12% in the prior year same period. We will continue to invest in our back shop and build out a team that is value-added to our operations, sales and marketing programs. There will be opportunity to further leverage G&A in 2024 and beyond, but it will be at a thoughtful and methodical pace. \r\nFocusing now on liquidity and capital resources. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash in excess of $755 million and net working capital in excess of $928 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled in excess of $140 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, which compares to $108 million in net cash provided by operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. \r\nWe will continue to invest in our business (technical difficulty).\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nTwo questions for me. One, just on gross margin, maybe talk a little bit about why it stepped back in 4Q relative to 3Q, even after adjusting for the promotional allowance accrual last quarter, meaning I would have expected to see a little bit better. Was there some sort of one-offs in that number? And how do we think about progression of that into '24? \r\nAnd then the second question, I appreciate the commentary on inventories from a channel standpoint with your largest customer. But if I take a look at what the sales look like in the [scanner] data track channels in addition to what you disclosed in the regulatory filings on Amazon and Costco sales, I still get a fairly big disconnect between what it looks like you should have sold in the quarter and what you actually did, meaning that you undershipped somewhere in the channel. So maybe you could help with that, too.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Mark. I'll join in on the first part of the question, and I'll throw it over to Jarrod as well. I think when you look at the overall margins, I think we're really pleased with the margins, especially for the full year, up over 660 basis points. Just a phenomenal job on behalf of the team on supply chain and our key accounts team. We're maintaining a pricing promotional architecture within the category.\r\nWhen you look at the, really the fourth quarter, we did launch a new line, our Celsius Essentials line, which are the 16-ounce line, and we had a variety of innovational launches that were executed during the quarter. So I think we're pretty pleased with where the margins came in, and there's opportunities to improve going forward. But at this point in time, I think that's a -- team did a really good job for the year. \r\nAnd in regards to inventory by channel, we did have some seasonal impact in Q4 that we did experience. We did have good results on Amazon and within the club channel, but we did see especially impacted mainly in food and really large format. A lot of our volume, we've done a great job on half of our distribution partner as well, really keeping the amount of cases on display up. We're still gaining -- we hope to gain additional placements and additional expansion in the upcoming sets that are being reset. But we do rely heavily, especially in large format on display activity. And when you look at the fourth quarter, we do see a lot of display activity coming from seasonal items that we're competing with outside of the summer or the rest of the year. So those are some headwinds we experienced in the fourth quarter, but I'll throw it over to Jarrod for any additional highlights.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nNo, you're right, John. It's -- when we're looking at kind of just more of a days-on-hand perspective with our largest distributor, we did have the innovations that we filled the pipe with that would offset, I would say maybe some reductions you're talking about, Mark. But on a net-net basis, the days on hand in total for us was in good shape. And to John's point, the Q4 tends to be a little bit pressured just because of the inventory on hand across our retail customers and our mass and grocery customers.\n\nMark Stiefel Astrachan\n\nGot it. Maybe just one follow-up then. If we think about the innovation in your comments you just made about the net-net kind of equaling out. It sounds like you're saying that the innovation offset the legacy products. Is that the case as you think about the shelf resets and incremental distribution, meaning it can't be a 1:1, so you're going to add more space. So why wouldn't the Pepsi system take more of the products, meaning taking innovation plus the legacy because you've got to backfill the legacy sales?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think when we looked at our #1 customer, we look at their inventory levels, they're fairly consistent with Q3 to Q4. So even though we did take some innovation on. So it's -- I think if we look at the scan data, we had really strong scan data in the fourth quarter, and it's -- we'll see how this continues to evolve.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes, it's a good question, Mark. I think, we can just tell you where we were as of 12/31 and on a net-net basis, in total, our days on hand were consistent and in good shape. And as we got to January, we started rolling out all of the innovation that you can see all across the U.S., and it's been very successful and being very good and it has been incremental thus far.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nSo I was hoping to get some perspective on how you're thinking about the market share trajectory from here. Obviously, things sort of leveled out towards the latter portion of '23, but we've actually seen some nice improvement to start the year. Maybe just to start, is the improvement we've seen year-to-date, largely a function of kind of that innovation you touched on rather than shelf resets. And then I guess with more resets to come, how would you think investors should think about the share trajectory as we look out to March and into the spring. Jarrod, you mentioned that you've now surpassed 10%. You're now focusing on a new target. So just any color on what that new target might be from a share perspective.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. No. Thank you, Peter. I mean we're not going to give any forward guidance on the future share, but we do look at the current trajectories and where we are currently at within different category -- within a variety of segments and the categories. And you mentioned Amazon. We disclosed Amazon. We're close to a 20 share within the energy category on Amazon. And then -- if you also look at -- I mentioned in my script, we have 12 key markets that we're tracking ahead of 15 share within the category and that's MULOC data. So there is a good trajectory there.\r\nI think the biggest opportunity for us when you look at it is really in convenience. And we've built this brand going through the variety of channels. And the last -- the biggest opportunity is in convenience, where you about 56% 57% of all sales are sold. \r\nSo that's where we anticipate the biggest resets to take place. In the coming resets, right now, in the convenience channel, we are just at a 10 share. So we're really excited about the opportunities you have there versus if you just look at the food category, we're roughly around a 16 share within the energy category. \r\nSo those are some recent data points that we have that, that we've shared within the script as well as in the earnings release. And we've talked before, we're somewhere between the average, as Jarrod mentioned, we're about we closed at about a 10 share, and we're on close to a 20 share within Amazon. So we're working hard. The team is working hard and we're executing, and that doesn't include the new 16-ounce Essentials line, which is just getting started this year, which we're excited about.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nNo, that's really helpful. And then I guess just on follow-up just on international. Can you maybe help us understand how we should think about the contribution from a revenue perspective. Are you exploring any additional markets for this year? Or would anything else kind of be more of a '25 narrative? And then just within that, I'm sure a lot of people and you've gotten this question a lot, but just, maybe explain why Suntory was the distributor of choice for the U.K. and Ireland?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Peter. I think number one, when we look at international expansion, we just went into Canada. We talked about that into -- on the script. We're really excited on the consumer acceptance. We're also excited about the -- we're in 7-Eleven in Couche-Tard. It's product is doing really well, and we're expanding. So our partner is excited. Canada should be a big market. U.K., did announce Suntory for our partner there. They -- we're looking for the best partners to align with on our go-to-market strategy. One thing that was very attractive about Suntory is their access to the gym community. \r\nAnd we're really focused on a methodical approach as we expand and grow, really about building awareness, trial, that foundational base of loyalty and then scaling. So as we look to see the size and the timing and sequencing of international, I think that's -- we'll know that as we go through these markets and expand in these markets. And how quickly we are accepted, we can move as fast as we can. But we want to be very cognizant on entering new markets through a methodical approach about building that loyal foundation before we go and overall scale. So those are the comments there in regards, and we're really excited about our partnership with Suntory.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nYou touched on unmeasured channels as one of your big opportunities and gave some examples, corporate cafeterias, universities vending. There's lots of physical distribution points under all that. And I just would love to get a sense of how we should think about how quickly -- how close to hand those are? How quickly those could ramp up, kind of what the trajectory might look like for momentum in those areas?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I think everyone is really excited about that. When you look at our PepsiCo revenues, over 12% is coming from really the foodservice. Internally here, we think there's a big opportunity there. We see that Celsius is much broader opportunity when you look at the TAM versus, say, traditional energy, we're seeing consumers -- consumer consumption increase outside of that energy need state. We're seeing the product being paired with sandwiches and smoothies and bowls and a variety of opportunities for fast casual. \r\nSo I think it's a little bit too early for us to really know how big that opportunity is. We have a -- we'll probably know over the next 12 to 24 months as we further expand in some additional quick service as well as expand in additional foodservice accounts and then universities and hospitals as well is a huge opportunity for us. Not able to quantify that at this time, but we do see it as big opportunity.\n\nMichael Scott Lavery\n\nOkay. And just on the Canada, U.K., Ireland launches, as we think about margins for 2024, obviously, you'd spend ahead of really ramping those revenues. And so all else equal, should we expect a dip in EBITDA margins for -- or EBIT margins for 2024 versus 2023? Or can you just give us a sense of how to think about the spending or what's in your plans for how that looks?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I'll turn that over to Jarrod for additional comments.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. So they're going to be a little different. Canada where most of the population is, I think, within 80 miles of the U.S. border and also being so close. We actually already had a co-packer in Canada that we were using as a backup for our U.S. business. So that rollout and that growth, we think, will be at a different trajectory than the U.K., which we're kind of launching from 0. So there will be investment in both markets as we build brand awareness and as we really build out the system. We won't have the same scale and leverage advantages within the manufacturing as we do in the U.S. So there is going to be some costs and some investment there. But it will be, let's call it -- it's not going to be a significant component of either our growth or our cost infrastructure this year. So we do believe that the numbers that we discussed on our prepared remarks, we'll be able to handle those investments as well.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. And I'll just -- in regards to -- when you look at it, Michael, one thing we've noticed is the brand awareness, even though we're not in the U.K., there is an underlying brand awareness just associated with -- the world is really so small these days, a one click away. So a lot of our influencers and social media activations are actually being picked up with our potential consumers in the U.K. So we had a little bit -- we have more brand awareness than we actually had initially anticipated based on our research. So we're excited, we think it's going to be a great market for us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush Securities.\n\nGerald John Pascarelli\n\nGreat. Just one on gross margin. Another quarter in the high 40s here. But in the energy category, you've already had a larger competitor take a rate increase. There's sentiment that your larger competitor will ultimately follow suit. So in the event this happens, how do you think about managing your price gaps relative to peers? I guess, just curious on your thoughts around a potential rate increase this year as that would obviously imply upside to your high 40s margin target? Any color there would be great.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Thank you, Gerald. There's opportunities. We want to be a premium-priced product. I think if you look at it per ounce basis, we feel we're very competitively priced. There's a variety of different levers than just taking frontline pricing. So we have our pricing promotional strategies that we utilize as well. We just -- we're launching a new line extension as well with our Celsius Essential 16-ounce. And then you also -- you have your pricing architecture by channel as well so in pack size. \r\nSo there's ways to navigate that. I think we're very pleased with the way we finished the year with margins and we're really focused on driving share and revenue growth and continue to drive consumer consumption and ultimately, that daily consumption we're looking for. And we're just really getting started here. When you look at just now a 10 share in the energy category in convenience. So there's a long runway ahead. But it's something we watch closely. At this point, we're not going to make any comments on future any price increases at this time.\n\nGerald John Pascarelli\n\nUnderstood. Just one more for me. I think your nonmeasured channel revenue came in a little better than expected, specifically related to Amazon at least what we were modeling for. In a lower seasonal quarter, your 4Q absolute revenue is almost in line with your second quarter, which obviously benefited from Prime Day. So any incremental color on the drivers in the quarter within that channel would be helpful if you could provide any.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. I mean Amazon, we had a great -- in the quarter, it was a great period. And there is a lot of timing as well within shipments and how the Amazon kind of controls or feeds inventory through their warehouses based on their algorithms. So we're going to keep shipping them. We're going to -- we're #1 energy drink right now, roughly about a 20 share in the energy category. I don't really have much color than that, but continue to drive further revenues through that channel. It is an omnichannel world, and that's something we really focus here at Celsius. We want to deliver Celsius to consumers when they want it, how they want it.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI think it does show too, that there is still opportunity for continued growth within the Amazon channel. So it's not necessarily slowing down suddenly just because we got to a certain spot within that. So I do see that as a continued growth opportunity for us as we look out into 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Sean McGowan with ROTH Capital Partners.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nA couple of quickies here. On the sales and marketing, give some good color on what we expect in the first quarter. And I think that rate of 23% is a little higher than you had talked about for some periods in the past. Is that a good number to use for the full year of '24?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI think I referred to Q1 and Q4 in my prepared remarks. And if you look at our Q1 activations and activity, we've got the Super Bowl activations we did that that we believe were very successful. We've actually got a Jake Paul fight this weekend down in Puerto Rico with another number of influencers that we support. We kicked off the MLS last week or a couple of weeks ago. We kicked off the F1 partnership. So we've got a number of things that are really rolling in Q1 to keep the momentum going. \r\nAs we look at a full year basis, historically, we've been in the 22% to 24% range. We were at 20% on a year-to-date basis in 2023. I think those are kind of the data points to stick to. If we've got opportunity to invest ahead of growth, we're going to continue to invest it. We're going to spend our money wisely. John and I require an ROI on everything we do. So we're not going to spend foolishly. But if we see opportunity to push growth, we'll push growth, if we don't see it, we'll continue to lever.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nOkay. And then on the Essentials line, could you give us, I mean, that's pretty rapid acceleration of ACV. Where do you think that goes? And basically, more generally, what is the plan for additional SKUs and additional outlets for that line. I'm seeing it in its own cooler or a separate cooler in some stores. Do you think this can double that? Can you get to a 80% plus ACV by the end of the year?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nThat's -- well, we've never launched a new line with our new distribution partner, PepsiCo. So I think we have a lot to learn. We are working hard. We think it can definitely be incremental. There is a lot of opportunity in there. That 16-ounce Celsius Essentials has been really well recepted by consumers. What's great? It's not cannibalizing existing sales. So we are bringing in additional new consumers and converting new consumers into the Celsius portfolio. So that has us really excited. It's not -- we're not trading our existing consumers. So the initial data.\r\nIt's still early. When you look at it, you're only talking like 8 weeks, 12 weeks of data we have at best in certain stores. So we really need to get a little bit more data underneath our belts as we move into -- get through Q1 and most importantly, see what these resets bring that are coming out. So I think this summer, we'll have a better read on how this portfolio is going to perform the Celsius Essential line within our overall global portfolio.\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nYes. It's a great product. You should get out and taste it, if you haven't yet.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nIt tastes great.\n\nSean Patrick McGowan\n\nI have some in my office.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley.\n\nEric Adam Serotta\n\nGreat. So could you give a little bit more granularity as to what drove the step-up in Pepsi revenue through the foodservice channel? I think it had been running at 10%, now it's at 12.5%. I think Jersey Mikes and Dunkin' are still very early days, and I'm not sure if those go through Pepsi, so maybe you could clarify that. But what specific channels are you seeing traction in, in foodservice through Pepsi? \r\nAnd then a broader question, in terms of the new SKUs that you're adding, particularly on the Vibes and the core flavors, what are you seeing in terms of incrementality there? How are the sort of legacy flavors and by legacy core and Vibes flavors performing as you're introducing these new SKUs? And then sort of what do you see as the limit for SKU count or flavor variety here, you're still a long way from Monster and Red Bull?\n\nJarrod Langhans\n\nI'll start with the foodservice one. John can have the -- all the other ones. So foodservice, I look at that as just continued momentum. I mean, if you look at our club program, once we start launching with them, we've got good progress, good momentum, but then you really see the volumes and velocity is growing. We're seeing the same thing across foodservice. We also had the college program fully in place in Q4. So as we talked about last quarter over the summer season, it tends to die down a bit when the college campus is empty out. \r\nWe're also seeing great progress in the other channels within foodservice that we're in. You mentioned, Mikes, you mentioned Dunkin', there's also hospitals. There's a variety of other food establishments. And so we're just continuing to see ongoing momentum across that channel, and we're really seeing that grow and be built out. And our distributor has really been helping significantly with that. So continued momentum, and we're doing great there. But let me throw the other ones over to John.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. And just a further detail on that. I think we're also seeing great momentum. And you talked about the step up and Jarrod, you mentioned college universities as a big opportunity and seeing growth there. But also vending. Keep in mind, vending is also going through that foodservice and the vending, we've expanded in vending. We're seeing great results in vending. \r\nAnd at-work micro markets, we talked about those prior on several calls prior. The at-work micro-market opportunity is really good. I mean you see a lot of opportunities at work locations. So you're seeing the product continuing to scale. And I agree with you, Eric. I think seeing that go from 10% to 12%, just shows you the growth opportunity we have on an overall basis in this nontracked channel opportunity. \r\nLooking at new SKUs, the Vibe line, we're excited about the Vibe line, talk about the success we had, I mentioned on the comments on the call earlier that Cosmic Vibe, we launched at Circle K and really going intergalactic with the theme of Space -- the Space Odyssey with our 2 new Vibe flavors to have a Space team. We're really excited on rolling that out. We're going to have some events coming up at Coachella and a variety of neat things to -- that you, guys, will be able to see. \r\nThe Vibe line is going to be a totally separate line. We're going to scale and grow that. I think there's a lot of opportunities to bring out innovative flavors and experiences with every sip. And then our core flavors, the team continues to come out with great flavors. I mean, you look at core, even expanding the core into our no Fizz line as well, where there's Blue Raspberry Lemonade that we launched at 7-Eleven in Q1 has been phenomenal. I mean the product tastes great and really expands this non-Fizz or non-carb opportunity that could be in wholly another revenue stream and ultimately an extension of our portfolio as well. \r\nSo we're monitoring the SKUs. Obviously, you need to do SKU rationalization. So that's something we talk internally at innovation meetings. We'll be doing that each year. We want to -- we'll cut our, as I call it, our tail or slow-moving SKUs. But we do see consumers looking for new innovation and staying within our portfolio, which is great. So our new Sparkling Peach, Raspberry Peach is phenomenal, great flavor. Eric, try it, please go out and try it. I think you'll enjoy as much as we do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens.\n\nJames Ronald Salera\n\nI wanted to drill down a little bit on the coolers because I have been in Cleveland, Ohio, and I was very surprised to see a Celsius branded cooler very prominently displayed at the cash wrap of the local grocerier. And so can you just talk about kind of the channel strategy there? How you want to get those coolers placed? And then maybe as a part 2 to that question, just any color you can offer on incremental uplift, velocity, repeat rates, trial buys in locations that do have the branded fridges?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. Jim, it's a big, big initiative we've had over the years trying to get more cooler placement. If you've been tracking the company over the years, we've been historically sold warm. So we had to build a loyal consumer that would actually have to take the product home and chill it and then drink of the daily lifestyle and routine. And that really shows to the loyalty around the Celsius consumer. \r\nCold availability is key to the success in order to compete in the energy category, especially with the impulse purchases. That is the biggest opportunity for us, and kind of mentioning it prior to the question, when we look at the convenience channel, that impulse purchase is key to the success of where we want to go and who we want to be in the category. \r\nSo we have -- we placed about 10,000 coolers. We are investing in more coolers. We're working on placing more coolers. We want to be right at checkout. Eye-level is critical. We're talking to a variety of retailers as well, to gain additional checkout coolers. So I think that's a big opportunity. Most recently down in South Florida, if you look at Publix, we've gained checkout coolers, and we're looking to gain additional checkout coolers on the next reset. \r\nSo that's a big opportunity. We do see uplift. If you're by the register and you're cold, kind of the saying we say internally here, if it's cold, it's sold. So the other thing is stacking high and watch it fly. Some comments we make around displays. But definitely a lift, the exact lift is hard to say because each channel and each store in each region is quite different on the velocity levels, but there is a substantial lift.\n\nJames Ronald Salera\n\nOkay. Great. And maybe one follow-up on that. Are all of the actual use in the cooler consistent across the portfolio? Or do you guys make changes on that based on channel, local geography? Like could we see a Celsius lines in there? Or some of the other product innovations show up in the coolers?\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nYes. That's a great question. So we do have planograms and progressions we work on based on the size of the cooler. There is a little bit of regional seasonality that based on a retailer, we do exclusive flavors. So like at Circle K, we did our Cosmic Vibe. I talked about 7-Eleven, the new launch with the Raspberry Lemonade so -- Fizz-Free. \r\nSo you will see potentially unique flavors and given coolers, but we do have a standard national planogram that's being followed, probably not always followed to the tea, but that is something we work on as an overall organization and work with our PepsiCo partners to keep the progressions in the coolers in accordance to our planogram.\r\nSo the core should be have its own planogram, the Vibe should have a planogram and also our Fizz-Free line should have a planogram as well as our Celsius Essentials 16-ounce. So that's kind of how our go-to-market strategy.\n\nOperator\n\nThat's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand it back to John Fieldly for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Fieldly\n\nThank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our Celsius Holdings Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'd like to thank and close by thanking all of our employees. Your dedication to Celsius has helped to create the success we're enjoying today. And together, we'll continue to provide essential energy to more consumers so they can pursue their own live fit lifestyles with a cold Celsius in their hands. Celsius will be participating in several upcoming conferences details of which will be published on our Investor Relations corporate website. We look forward to seeing many of you there.\r\nThank you for your interest in Celsius. Stay healthy and live fit.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

        "title": "Decoding Celsius Holdings Inc (CELH): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Strengths highlight Celsius Holdings Inc's innovative product offerings and strategic partnerships. Weaknesses underscore the challenges of dependency on key distributors and raw material availability. Opportunities emphasize the potential for market expansion and product line diversification. Threats include regulatory risks and intense competition in the functional beverage industry.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CELH.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, Celsius Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CELH) filed its 10-K report, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial health and strategic positioning. The company, known for its functional energy drinks, continues to make strides in the beverage market, with a significant 94% revenue concentration in North America. Celsius Holdings Inc's financial tables reveal a robust performance, with a notable forward stock split reflecting investor confidence. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the filing, offering investors a nuanced perspective on the company's potential. Decoding Celsius Holdings Inc (CELH): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Innovation and Market Appeal: Celsius Holdings Inc's core strength lies in its innovative product lines, such as CELSIUS Originals, Vibe, and the newly introduced CELSIUS ESSENTIALS. These offerings cater to a diverse consumer base, particularly fitness enthusiasts, by combining nutritional science with mainstream beverage appeal. The proprietary MetaPlus formulation, free from aspartame and high fructose corn syrup, positions the company as a leader in the health-conscious segment of the energy drink market.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Distribution: The 20-year distribution agreement with PepsiCo, which holds an 8.5% stake in Celsius Holdings Inc, is a testament to the company's strategic acumen. This partnership not only bolsters the company's distribution capabilities but also enhances its market reach. The expansion of this relationship into Canada and the new agreement with Suntory Beverage & Food in the UK further solidify the company's international presence and growth trajectory.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Key Distributors: A significant weakness for Celsius Holdings Inc is its reliance on PepsiCo for distribution, with sales to Pepsi constituting 59.4% of total net revenue. This concentration risks the company's operational stability should any disagreements or terminations arise. The company's financial health is closely tied to this relationship, as evidenced by receivables from Pepsi representing 69.0% of total receivables as of December 31, 2023.\n\nSupply Chain Vulnerabilities: The company has faced challenges with raw material shortages, particularly aluminum cans, which are crucial for product packaging. Such shortages can disrupt production and affect financial performance. Additionally, the company's reliance on third-party manufacturing and distribution exposes it to potential inefficiencies and quality control issues that could impact its brand reputation and customer satisfaction.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMarket Expansion: Celsius Holdings Inc's recent international agreements pave the way for expansion into new markets, such as the UK and Ireland. The company's ability to adapt and cater to diverse consumer preferences across different regions presents a significant opportunity for growth and increased market share.\n\nProduct Line Diversification: The introduction of the CELSIUS Essentials line demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and meeting evolving consumer demands. Continued investment in product development, particularly in the health and wellness segment, can lead to a broader product portfolio and attract new customer segments.\n\nThreats\n\nRegulatory Risks: The functional beverage industry is subject to stringent regulations by bodies such as the FDA and FTC. Any adverse actions or changes in regulations could impact Celsius Holdings Inc's operations, from product composition to marketing strategies. The company must navigate these regulatory landscapes carefully to avoid potential fines, recalls, or reputational damage.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: The energy drink market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for consumer attention. Celsius Holdings Inc must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to maintain its competitive edge. The company also faces the threat of private-label brands from consolidated retailers, which could exert downward pricing pressure and erode profit margins.\n\nIn conclusion, Celsius Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CELH) exhibits a strong foundation with its innovative product lines and strategic partnerships, particularly with PepsiCo. However, the company's heavy reliance on key distributors and potential supply chain disruptions represent vulnerabilities that require careful management. Opportunities for market expansion and product diversification are promising, but regulatory challenges and a competitive landscape pose significant threats. Overall, Celsius Holdings Inc's strategic direction and financial prudence will be critical in leveraging its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to discuss upon 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, also taking into account the urbanization dynamics globally. If you want to skip all the detailed analysis of ours, you can go directly to 5Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nIt is projected that urban populations worldwide will increase to 80% by 2050, up from the current 55%. Global material consumption is anticipated to more than double to approximately 89 billion tonnes, as reported by the UN International Resource Panel. The wealthiest nations consume 10 times more than the poorest, with consumption rates in Asia and Africa expected to grow rapidly until 2050.\n\nDeveloping low-carbon and resource-efficient cities can help alleviate the negative effects of increased material consumption, including pollution and carbon emissions. Despite covering only 2% of the Earth's land, cities utilize over 75% of the planet's material resources. Urban expansion is forecasted to escalate global material consumption from 41.1 billion tonnes in 2010 to around 89 billion tonnes by 2050. The majority of urban growth, according to the UN, will occur in Global South cities, particularly in China, India, and Nigeria. Asia is projected to experience a significant rise in consumption due to its high concentration of megacities (cities with over 10 million inhabitants). However, the most substantial growth is anticipated in Africa over the next few decades. The continent's population is expected to double by 2050, with material consumption skyrocketing from 2 billion tonnes to 17.7 billion tonnes annually.\n\nMost countries with the lowest urban populations are situated in Africa. Despite their low urban population percentages, several of these countries are undergoing rapid urbanization. For instance, Burundi has an urban population of 14.4%, which is relatively low, but it has the world's highest urbanization rate at 5.43%. Similarly, Uganda's urban population stands at 26.2%, while its urbanization rate is 5.41%. These countries are often classified among the least developed or underdeveloped nations globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the growing population across the world, there\u2019s a direct impact on the global food market in the world. As the world's population grows and urbanizes, the consumer food industry is facing some major supply chain hurdles, price hikes, and changing consumer preferences. This situation has led to increased costs, operational disruptions, and challenges in labor and procurement. However, it has also opened up new possibilities for companies to innovate and expand by introducing fresh products and top-notch services. The global consumer-packaged foods market is worth around $1.1 trillion currently in 2024, and is expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030.\n\nAmidst this, and before we move on to our list of 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, it\u2019s significant to see what great businesses food companies are doing all across the world. Namely, we are going to discuss PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD).\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP)\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQGS:PEP) is a big American company that sells food, snacks, and drinks. It's based in Harrison, New York, near Purchase. PepsiCo manages everything from making its products to getting them out there to customers. In the last quarter, they made $1.3 billion in profit, with earnings of 94 cents per share. Their sales were a bit lower than expected at $27.85 billion. This is the first time since 2020 that their sales dropped from the previous year, partly due to exchange rates and having an extra week in the prior year.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a fizzy drink made by the Coca-Cola Company. They sell their drinks all over the world, with people guzzling down more than 1.8 billion of their beverages daily in 2013. Coke is aiming for 6% to 7% organic sales growth in 2024, which is a bit higher than Pepsi's target of 4%. They're also expecting their earnings to rise faster than their revenue, which could help them maintain their strong profit margin of nearly 30% of sales.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)\n\nMcDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), a big American fast-food chain, started back in 1940 in San Bernardino, California, by the McDonald brothers. It's super popular with families and kids all around the world. After experiencing some amazing sales growth for three years, McDonald's seems to be cooling down a bit. The burger giant, based in Chicago now, predicts their sales at existing locations will go up by 3% to 4% this year, which is around their usual average. This is a drop from the huge jumps they saw in 2021 and 2022, as well as the 9% growth last year. 15 Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities\n\nAn aerial view of a suburban community, with residential homes stretching into the horizon.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities, we referred to the urbanization rate of the countries, as provided by the World Population Review, as in 2024. For the countries with equal urbanization rates, we ranked them on the basis of total population, furthering the extent of urbanization measure of the country. Also, please note that all population figures mentioned pertain to 2024, except mentioned otherwise. With this, let\u2019s now jump to our list of Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Lebanon\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 89.40%\n\nWith a population of 5.3 million, Lebanon has faced numerous crises, including an influx of 1.5 million refugees since 2011, straining public services. Urban areas, where many refugees settle, are hit hardest. Challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, economic collapse, currency devaluation, and Beirut explosions have pushed 74% of the population into poverty. Civil unrest and protests over government corruption have worsened the situation, leading to a banking system crisis and currency devaluation. Addressing these issues is crucial, especially in urban areas where 90% of the population lives, to ensure everyone has access to basic services and rights.\n\n14. Bahrain\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 89.90%\n\nWith a population of 1.5 million people, Bahrain ranks ninth among the top destinations worldwide for expatriates thanks to its easy visa process, smooth dealings with local authorities, and hassle-free bank account setup. Bahrain took the top spot in the Expat Essentials Index, covering housing, bureaucracy, language, and digital resources. The UAE and Saudi Arabia landed second and ninth places, respectively.\n\n13. Gabon\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 91.00%\n\nWith a population of 2.5 million, Gabon has a wealth of natural resources like timber, manganese, and oil. It's the fifth biggest oil producer in Africa, which played a key role in its solid growth in the latter part of the 20th century. Currently, the oil industry makes up half of Gabon's GDP and a whopping 80% of its exports.\n\n12. Jordan\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.00%\n\nJordan has a population of 11.4 million. In Jordan, the rural population has stayed pretty low for almost 70 years, and it's been slowly decreasing since the mid-2000s, a trend that's expected to keep going. The urban population surpassed the rural one for the first time back in 1960, and it's been steadily skyrocketing ever since. This surge in urban populations is expected to continue in the coming decades.\n\n11. Japan\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.00%\n\nJapan, with a population of whopping 123 million, is super packed with people in its cities, making it one of the most urbanized places globally. Out of its 47 prefectures, only 7 have a population under 1 million. After the Tokyo earthquake in 1923, the buildings in Tokyo initially showed Western influences, but eventually, they stuck to their own design style. Tokyo and other Japanese cities expanded slowly through land readjustment, without any grand boulevards or fancy monuments. Now, Japan is kicking butt in the world of architectural design!\n\n10. Argentina\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.50%\n\nTaking up a huge chunk of land in the southern part of South America, Argentina, with a population of 46 million, boasts the second-largest economy on the continent, with a GDP around $1 trillion, as at the end of 2023. The country is blessed with abundant natural resources and excels in beef and cereal production. Argentina is a hot spot for adventure tourism and has a top-notch IT sector.\n\n9. Israel\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 92.90%\n\nWith a total population of 9.3 million, around 92% of Israelis reside in urban areas. Several contemporary towns and cities, merging ancient and modern elements, are constructed on historically significant sites, such as Jerusalem, Safed, Be'er Sheva, Tiberias, and Akko.\n\n8. Netherlands\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 93.20%\n\nNetherlands has a population of 17.7 million. The biggest urban bunch in the Netherlands is called Randstad, which includes the top four cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. Among these, three have been granted historical city privileges: Utrecht since 1122, Amsterdam since 1306, and Rotterdam since 1340.\n\n7. Puerto Rico\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 93.60%\n\nFor over 400 years, Puerto Rico, home to 3.3 million people, \u00a0has relied heavily on agriculture for its economy. However, changes in society and politics in the early 20th century led to a move toward industry. This shift, along with a growing population, has led to the expansion of urban areas. Even though poverty has decreased in Puerto Rico and the most poverty-stricken states over the past 50 years, Puerto Rico still faces significantly high levels of poverty compared to its historical trends and other areas.\n\n6. Uruguay\n\nUrbanization Rate 2024: 95.80%\n\nThe most recent census in Uruguay shows that over 95% of the population resides in cities, out of 3.4 million total population. This urban living trend has been a longstanding feature of the country and is projected to grow in the future. That's why Uruguay has decided to concentrate its National Adaptation Plan (NAP-Cities) efforts on urban areas, where essential services and key economic activities are centered. Creating a National Adaptation Plan for Cities and Infrastructures (NAP-Cities) is a fresh initiative at the national level to blend adaptation strategies into city planning and infrastructure development at both the national and local levels in Uruguay.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about the 5Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2030 20 States with the Oldest Population in the US 20 Countries with the Highest Homeless Population\n\nDisclosure: None. 15Countries Where Much or Most of Population Lives in Cities is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Assessing the Upcoming Dividend and Historical Performance of PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nPepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) recently announced a dividend of $1.27 per share, payable on 2024-04-01, with the ex-dividend date set for 2024-02-29. As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's delve into PepsiCo Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.\n\nWhat Does PepsiCo Inc Do?\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with PEP. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?\n\nPepsiCo is a global leader in snacks and beverages, owning well-known household brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos, among others. The company dominates the global savory snacks market and also ranks as the second-largest beverage provider in the world (behind Coca-Cola) with diversified exposure to carbonated soft drinks, or CSD, as well as water, sports, and energy offerings. Convenience foods account for approximately 55% of its total revenue, with beverages making up the rest. PepsiCo owns the bulk of its manufacturing and distribution capacity in the United States and overseas. International markets make up 40% of total sales and one third of operating profits. PepsiCo Inc's Dividend Analysis\n\nA Glimpse at PepsiCo Inc's Dividend History\n\nPepsiCo Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1973, distributing dividends on a quarterly basis. The stock is recognized as a dividend king, a prestigious title awarded to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 51 years. This track record reflects a strong commitment to shareholder returns.\n\nBelow is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.\n\nBreaking Down PepsiCo Inc's Dividend Yield and Growth\n\nAs of today, PepsiCo Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.95% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.03%. This indicates an anticipated increase in dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, PepsiCo Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 7.10%. This rate decreased slightly to 6.50% per year over a five-year period. However, over the past decade, PepsiCo Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 7.90%. Based on PepsiCo Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of PepsiCo Inc stock is approximately 4.04%.\n\nStory continues PepsiCo Inc's Dividend Analysis\n\nThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability\n\nTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-12-31, PepsiCo Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.65.\n\nPepsiCo Inc's profitability rank, a measure of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers, is 9 out of 10, indicating good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.\n\nGrowth Metrics: The Future Outlook\n\nPepsiCo Inc's strong growth rank of 9 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is promising relative to its competitors. The company's revenue per share and 3-year revenue growth rate indicate a strong revenue model, with revenue increasing by approximately 9.40% per year on average, outperforming about 67.33% of global competitors.\n\nThe 3-year EPS growth rate underscores PepsiCo Inc's ability to grow its earnings, vital for sustaining dividends, with an average annual increase of 11.30%, outperforming about 53.26% of global competitors. Additionally, PepsiCo Inc's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.60% outperforms approximately 46.27% of global competitors.\n\nConclusion: Evaluating PepsiCo Inc's Dividend Prospects\n\nIn conclusion, PepsiCo Inc's upcoming dividend, historical dividend growth, and current payout ratio reflect a strong commitment to shareholder returns. The company's robust profitability and positive growth metrics provide a solid foundation for future dividend sustainability.

        "title": "3 Cash Cow Dividend Stocks for Outsized Income &amp; Upside",
        "content": "Following another shaky day in the market, investors may want to consider cash cow dividend stocks. They\u2019re not sexy and they probably won\u2019t make you rich. However, they get the job done when faced with challenging circumstances.\n\nFor football fans, cash cow dividend stocks symbolize the jumbo package of Wall Street. Basically, you grab your biggest, meanest players \u2013 Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s favorite word applies here \u2013 to drive the ball for that extra yard or two that you need.\n\nJust like in the investing arena, it\u2019s not a play you run all the time. It\u2019s predictable and it expends a lot of energy for minimal gain. But sometimes all you need is that one yard to move the sticks or to drive for six. In that case, these cash cow dividend stocks will do you just fine.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Logotype of PepsiCo (PEP) against the blue sky\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a soft drink and snack foods giant, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) really needs no introduction. If you do, just look in your refrigerator or your pantry. Chances are, you\u2019ve got a PepsiCo-owned brand somewhere. Given its massive business and the predictability of its revenue streams, PEP makes a great case for cash cow dividend stocks.\n\nTurning to the financials, the company is sitting on cash and cash equivalents of $9.71 billion (since the fourth quarter). It consistently generates positive free cash flow (FCF), with the latest print landing at $2.83 billion. Net income in Q4 clocked in at $1.3 billion, facilitating PepsiCo\u2019s solid 3.01% forward dividend yield. Even better, it commands 52 years of consecutive annual payout increases.\n\nFor the full year 2023, the soft-drink stalwart posted revenue of $91.47 billion. Looking ahead, analysts on average anticipate current year revenue to land at $94.7 billion. One year later, they forecast sales to reach $99.16 billion.\n\nLastly, Wall Street\u2019s experts rate PEP a moderate buy with a $189.44 average price target. That implies almost 13% upside potential, making PepsiCo one of the cash cow dividend stocks to consider.\n\nStory continues\n\nExxon Mobil (XOM) Exxon Retail Gas Location\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top-tier hydrocarbon stalwart, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another enterprise that doesn\u2019t need an introduction. Fundamentally, though, XOM might seem a challenging idea for cash cow dividend stocks. With so much attention paid to green and renewable energy infrastructures, Exxon Mobil appears anachronistic. Nevertheless, the world still runs on oil, making XOM a cynically effective idea.\n\nYou can\u2019t argue with the financials. As of Q4 2023, the company held $31.54 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As well, aside from an understandably rough year in 2020, Exxon has been robustly FCF positive. Last year, the metric stood at $33.45 billion. As for net income, the company\u2019s Q4 print was $7.63 billion.\n\nNaturally, the bottom line undergirds the oil giant\u2019s forward dividend yield of 3.65%. While that\u2019s a bit lower than the energy sector\u2019s average yield of 4.24%, it also boasts 41 years of consecutive annual payout increases.\n\nIn closing, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $125.75 average price target, implying almost 21% upside potential.\n\nSanofi (SNY) Sanofi (SNY) logo on the side of company branch in Germany\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nA French multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare company, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is a major component in medical innovations. Per its public profile, Sanofi covers seven major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, central nervous system, diabetes, internal medicine, oncology, thrombosis, and vaccines. Despite its relevance, SNY is off to a soft start, losing about 4% since the January opener.\n\nAlso, over the past 52 weeks, SNY moved up less than 1%. That has longtime shareholders frustrated. However, the disappointing performance presents a contrarian opportunity for prospective investors. For one thing, Sanofi benefits from sound financials. Currently, the company is sitting on a cash and cash equivalents war chest of $9.5 billion. It also has marketable securities amounting to $294 million.\n\nLast year, FCF landed at $7.89 billion while net income clocked in at $5.9 billion. While the company is going through a rough patch, it hasn\u2019t forgotten to reward its shareholders. Right now, its forward yield stands at 3.94%, above the healthcare sector\u2019s average yield of 1.58%.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts rate SNY a moderate buy with a $59 average price target, implying over 22% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Kellogg and PepsiCo are urging Gen Z to eat Doritos and cereal for dinner",
        "content": "Tired of meat and potatoes or chicken and rice for dinner? Food conglomerates like WK Kellogg and PepsiCo are pushing Frosted Flakes and Dorito casserole as pleasing alternatives.\n\nConvenience food brands are asking customers to consider their products beyond their conventional uses, as sales for snack products continue to waver amid inflation-induced price hikes.\n\nWK Kellogg cochairman and CEO Gary Pilnick encouraged cash-strapped consumers to have \u201ccereal for dinner,\u201d in a recent CNBC interview.\n\n\u201cThe cereal category has always been quite affordable, and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nPepsiCo is also asking consumers to get creative with their carbs. At an industry conference in Florida last week, CEO Ramon Laguarta said he hoped consumers would use salty snacks, such as Doritos and Rold Gold pretzels, as \u201cside dishes and ingredients\u201d in meals, extending their purpose beyond a midday or late-night munchie.\n\nTaco Bell consumers are no stranger to Doritos for dinner, such as Doritos Locos Tacos. PepsiCo wants to take this innovation further. At last week\u2019s Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, PepsiCo\u2019s presentation included a nod to the Mexico City street food Dorilocos or \u201cwalking taco,\u201d an open bag of tortilla chips topped with cucumbers, lime juice, and chamoy, among other ingredients. Last year, Doritos posted a recipe video on TikTok for Spicy Sweet Chili chocolate chip cookies using the eponymous Doritos flavor.\n\nDoritos is PepsiCo\u2019s ground zero to engage with Gen Z, who have turned their backs on sodas to pursue a healthy lifestyle. In December, PepsiCo launched a Doritos-flavored cocktail, which joined the beverage ranks with Starry, PepsiCo\u2019s bid for Gen Z\u2019s preferred soda. WK Kellogg tried to appeal to Gen Z\u2019s healthy sensibilities by launching its Eat Your Mouth Off vegan cereal last month.\n\nGen Z loves snacks\n\nGen Z doesn\u2019t mind making meals out of an amalgamation of nibbles, dubbed on TikTok as \u201cgirl dinner.\u201d Over half of 2,000 U.S. Zoomers surveyed by Ketchum said they piece together snacks to form a meal on a weekly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese pushes for innovation come after shaky fourth-quarter reports from the snack companies: PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter revenue drop earlier this month\u2014after years of double-digit price hikes\u2014including a 2% drop in volume for Frito Lay North America. Kellogg\u2019s fourth-quarter sales, which saw a 10% volume drop, tell a similar story, as the company continues to increase prices.\n\nFortune 500 executives calling for creative cereal and chip uses come at a tumultuous time for snack companies. WK Kellogg\u2019s \u201ccereal for dinner\u201d strategy has been around for years. In 2022, the company awarded $5,000 to five sweepstakes entrants who posted an Instagram photo of themselves eating cereal for breakfast with the hashtag #KelloggsCerealforDinnerEntry. The strategy has been employed to boost sales after the pandemic\u2019s initial cereal boom cooled. Its cereal sales have declined for decades as consumers go in search of healthier breakfasts or fast food offerings. Weight-loss-aiding drugs like Ozempic have tempered food sales at retail giants like Walmart, pressuring junk food brands to shrink portions.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason for these big snack brands to hold out hope. Kellogg\u2019s profits have stayed steady, as price increases counteracted sales dips and as demand for classic products such as Frosted Flakes remain resilient. The U.S. savory snack market is still expected to grow 6% annually from 2022 to 2027.\n\nThe continued profits of these companies mean that even though they\u2019re acknowledging consumers struggling to keep up with sky-high prices, they\u2019re unlikely to lower them anytime soon.\n\nGet used to higher prices\n\nBeyond convenience food brands, all groceries have gotten more expensive. While inflation rose 19% over the past four years, grocery food prices have increased 25%. Gen Z is particularly sensitive to these increases as a cost-conscious generation. Almost two of three Gen Zers buy a store\u2019s private brand always or frequently, according to a 2023 Private Label Manufacturers Association survey of 1,000 U.S. Zoomers.\n\nEven after trying to address sales dips, PepsiCo plans to \u201cmodestly\u201d increase prices this year. PepsiCo did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOne of the reasons for price hikes is \u201cgreedflation,\u201d or companies choosing to increase prices, even as inflation cools, taking advantage of consumers who were previously willing to pay more when the economy was more volatile. Food giants Kraft Heinz and Bunge were among several corporations to have their profits outpace inflation in 2022, according to a 2023 study by IPPR and Common Wealth.\n\nBut Braden Douglas, CEO of consumer marketing agency Crew Marketing Partners, told Fortune that food manufacturers aren\u2019t entirely the ones to blame for high prices.\n\n\u201cIt's easy to try to point fingers\u201d at manufacturers like PepsiCo, Douglas said, but every part of the food chain is being squeezed.\n\nMondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put told YahooFinance on Wednesday that the prices of Oreos and Ritz will likely go up as a result of the increased cost of sugar and cocoa. Grocery stores like Kroger are eager to raise product costs not only to maintain margins, but also grow them by nudging customers towards their own cheaper, private-brand products. Manufacturers want to raise prices because they\u2019re also raising wages to combat labor shortages.\n\nNo one wants to budge, Douglas said, but there will have to be interventions on multiple dimensions if consumers want to see well-priced products. That means either companies eating costs to counter inflation\u2014Ikea spent $1.1 billion to absorb inflation and lower the price of its goods\u2014or government intervention to subsidize production costs.\n\n\u201cIf people really cared about the consumer\u2014which they always say they do, but if they really did\u2014I think that their profit expectation has to change,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- A potential tax benefit is spurring US companies including PepsiCo Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. to sell bonds through their Singapore subsidiaries, fueling a record surge of sales from borrowers in the city state.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD\u2019s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Stock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap Freddie Mercury\u2019s London Residence Lists at \u00a330 Million Jacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87 Poland\u2019s Famously Frank Top Diplomat Lands a Blow With Rebuff of Russia\n\nThe tactic can allow companies to deduct interest expense from their taxable income in both the US and Singapore. That double deduction means that effective borrowing costs \u2014 after taxes \u2014 can be materially lower than they would be with a bond issued in the US.\n\nThe mechanics of qualifying for the benefit are complicated and a rule that emerged from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in December may wind up stopping firms from using the technique. But companies may be able to take advantage of it for at least the next three years.\n\nAs companies sell bonds, they are pushing debt sales volume from Singapore ever higher. Last year, corporates sold $51.5 billion of notes from the city state, more than double the previous year and an all-time record. That mainly came from Pfizer Inc.\u2019s sale of $31 billion of bonds, one of the biggest corporate bond offerings on record, in May 2023 through a Singapore unit to help finance an acquisition.\n\nThe sales have continued this year: PepsiCo Singapore Financing sold $1.75 billion of bonds earlier this month, and IBM International Capital sold $5.5 billion of securities in late January.\n\nA spokesperson for IBM declined to comment. PepsiCo and Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNew global tax rates are taking shape through the OECD to ensure minimum tax corporate rates are levied globally. Singapore domestic tax law allows a company, including a local subsidiary of a foreign corporation, to deduct interest payments on debt from their taxable income in the nation state. At the same time, the US tax code might allow companies to deduct a foreign branch\u2019s interest expense from its US taxable income.\n\nStory continues\n\n--With assistance from Finbarr Flynn.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations The High Cost of Eating Out in America Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

        "content": "Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) has been growing nicely despite moderate unit volume gains, led by price increases. However, as consumers start to show price increase fatigue, volume growth should come more into play in the future.\n\nCompany profile\n\nCoca-Cola owns a number of beverage brands in the soft drink, sports drink, energy drink, water, coffee, tea and juice categories. Its brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Powerade, Dasani, Vitaminwater, Costa and Minute Maid, among others.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ABNB.\n\nThe company's products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. It sells its concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners, as well as finished products to wholesalers, distirbutors and retailers.\n\nOpportunities and risks\n\nCoca-Cola has long been one of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s and Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) largest holdings, most recently representing about 6.80% of the insurance giant's investment portfolio. The guru originally bought the stock back in 1988 and has held on ever since. Coca-Cola Has Seen Strong Pricing Power\n\nSo what made Coca-Cola attractive to Buffett and other investors? First and foremost, the Coke brand is one of the most recognizable brands around the globe. It is the clear leader in the soft drink category with five of the top six global soft drink brands in the world. Brands are valuable, and there are not many as big as Coca-Cola in the food and beverage space.\n\nWhile overall global unit case volume growth has been modest, up only 2% in 2023 after 5% growth in 2022, what the company has shown is a lot of pricing power. Price and mix accounted for 10% growth in 2023 and 11% in 2022. As a result, Coca-Cola has seen strong organic revenue growth the past two years of 16% and 12%. It is looking for 6% to 7% organic growth in 2024.\n\nLatin America has been an area of particular strength for the company in recent years, with unit case volumes up 6% in 2022 and 5% in 2023, and concentrate sales up 7% in 2022 and 6% in 2023. This strength continued in the fourth quarter of 2023, with unit case volumes up 4% and concentrate sales up 10%.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola will also look to boost sales through its first new permanent soft drink flavor in quite some time. Over the past several years, it has offered some limited-edition flavors, but it recently announced Coca-Cola Spiced will become a permeant addition to its soft-drink roster to help connect with younger consumers whose tastes have shifted from older generations.\n\nThe company is also in the process of refranchising its company-owned bottling operations. The goal is to not only get cash for the deals, but to have it boost margins as well. Soda makers seem to go through phases of vertical integration and then selling off their company-owned bottlers. Coca-Cola is in the selling off phase at the moment.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the company is also eyeing its first big acquisition in years, looking to acquire healthy soda brand Poppi. The upstart beverage company recently turned heads with its first Superbowl advertisement claiming that soda will no longer be considered a dirty word. Coca-Cola has a strong track record with acquisitions, and if it acquires the company, would likely be able to accelerate the brand's growth given its huge distribution network.\n\nWhen it comes to risks, soda has certainly lost some share over the years to other beverage categories, including energy drinks and sparkling water. Soda has become linked to health issues, even diet versions, which has changed drinking habits in places like the U.S. and other areas, especially with younger generations. This should be a continued headwind in more developed markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Coca-Cola has taken a lot of price over the past few years. While it has shown pricing power, it may not be able to continue to increase prices at the same rate going forward. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for example, has said it is seeing some backlash from its customers over prices. All in all, it seems consumers are getting fed up with the rate of price increases throughout the consumer staple space.\n\nValuation\n\nCoca-Cola's stock currently trades at 17.40 times the 2024 consensus Ebitda of $15.28 billion and 16.30 times the 2025 consensus of $16.30 billion.\n\nIt trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 21 based on the 2024 consensus of $2.81 and nearly 20 times the 2025 consensus of $3.01.\n\nIt is projected to grow revenue by 0.40% this year and 4.90% in 2025. Its bottler refranchising will cut into revenue in 2024, which is why its organic revenue growth is projected to be higher.\n\nCoca-Cola trades at premium to its two soda peers, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP), despite expected slower revenue growth.\n\nHistorically, over the last several years, it has traded between 17 and 22 times enterprise value/Ebitda. That would place a fair value on the stock based on 2025 Ebitda of between $62 and $81, with a midpoint of $71.50.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoca-Cola has put together some solid revenue growth the past three years coming out of the pandemic. However, with consumers starting to push back on prices caused by high inflation, volume will likely start to come more into play over the new few years.\n\nThe company will likely continue to carry a premium valuation given its brand power, but the growth of the past few years should start to slow down in the coming years. This could lead it to trade closer to the lower end of its recent historical multiple range.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Ignore PepsiCo -- Here's a Better Stock for Passive Income",
        "content": "PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) recently gave investors some new reasons to feel cautious about the stock. While the company achieved solid sales growth this past year, demand slowed into early 2024, according to management's early February update. The consumer staples company is also projecting weaker sales trends ahead as its inflation-based price increases end.\n\nThat's unfortunate news for income investors since Pepsi and its 3% dividend yield are so popular with fans of passive income. But there's another top dividend company that looks more attractive today and pays a hefty yield of nearly 2.5%. Let's look at some reasons to buy McDonald's(NYSE: MCD) right now.\n\nSlower is OK\n\nMcDonald's shares fell in the wake of its early February earnings report, yet investors should see that drop as a chance to pick up a quality business at a discount. Sure, comparable-restaurant sales through late December slowed to 3% in the fourth quarter from 9% for the full 2023 year. The core U.S. market notched a mildly disappointing 4% increase compared to 9% in the prior quarter as well.\n\nThe chain will bounce back with some big growth avenues it can pursue this year. Its home delivery and drive-thru channels are highly popular, for example, and the chain is planning to stress its value proposition in the coming quarters to boost customer traffic back into positive territory.\n\nPepsi, on the other hand, seems much more constrained by the tough selling conditions that characterize the snacks, food, and at-home beverage niches. Investors should prefer to own stocks that have more control over their own fate, like McDonald's does.\n\nMarket-leading earnings\n\nMickey D's doesn't just have some of the highest profit margins in its industry, it is among the most profitable companies in any industry. Compare its nearly 50% operating profit margin with PepsiCo's 14%, or even with the 44% that Microsoft generates right now, and that's clear enough.\n\nStory continues MSFT Operating Margin (TTM) Chart\n\nMost of this success can be attributed to the dividend stock's lucrative selling model that relies on royalties, rent, and franchise fees from its huge global footprint of franchisees.\n\nIt also helps that McDonald's maintains the world's most valuable fast-food brand, with all the pricing power that this asset delivers. \"We remain confident in the resilience of our business amid macro challenges that will persist in 2024,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski told investors in mid-February.\n\nPrice and value\n\nYou'll pay a premium for McDonald's over PepsiCo and some other passive-income stocks, to be sure. Its price-to-sales ratio is over 8 compared to Pepsi's 2.5, in fact. Mickey D's also pays a more modest yield of 2.4%, while Pepsi is yielding closer to 3%.\n\nInvestors have to balance those weaknesses against the stock's clear operating advantages. McDonald's has shown it can grow through just about any selling environment. It can boost profit margins during booming consumer-spending periods and when shoppers are feeling price-sensitive. And through it all, the fast-food giant steadily hikes its dividend, as it has for nearly 50 consecutive years. That's a recipe for market-beating long-term returns for patient income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and McDonald's wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 11 best stocks that pay monthly dividends in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024.\n\nDividend income has risen from 2.85% in 1981 to 5.89% in 2014, while interest income has decreased from 13.5% to 8.6% during the same timeframe, as reported by S&P Dow Jones Indices. In addition to this, looking back to 1960, 69% of the overall return of the S&P 500 Index can be credited to the reinvestment of dividends and the compounded growth they generate over time.\n\nThere has been a new angle on dividend investing cropping up lately. Traditionally, investors leaned towards companies offering hefty dividends, assuming they were more dependable. However, recent studies suggest that companies maintaining a balance with sustainable dividends, without excessively high payouts, have actually yielded superior returns over the long term. A research conducted by Wellington Management split dividend-paying companies into five groups and then sorted them based on their payout levels from highest to lowest. Surprisingly, the companies that performed better than the S&P 500 Index fell into the second-highest quintile rather than the highest. This unexpected outcome suggests that some companies may have been overdoing it with their dividend payouts, leaving themselves with less capital for future growth. Meanwhile, companies with more moderate payouts were able to reinvest their earnings and maintain enough flexibility to continue offering steady dividends in the long run.\n\nApart from reliable dividends, the growth of dividends is also crucial to contemplate when investing in dividend stocks. According to research conducted by Ned Davis Research, companies that either increased or began paying dividends yielded the highest returns compared to other stocks, and they exhibited considerably less volatility. Additionally, the study highlighted a robust relationship between companies that consistently enhance their dividends and those boasting strong fundamentals, well-defined business strategies, and a sincere dedication to their shareholders. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stand out as top choices for dividend investors. These companies have demonstrated a strong dedication to their shareholders by consistently increasing their dividend payouts over many years.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile it's difficult to forecast the stock market's performance with absolute certainty, analysts are optimistic about dividend-paying stocks for 2024, especially following their subpar performance in 2023. In the Bloomberg Outlook report, analysts from Citigroup offered their perspective on investing in dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are the comments:\n\n\u201cWith investors swept up in the artificial intelligence fervor, valuations for dividend-paying stocks have quietly drifted toward multi-decade lows compared to the broader market. With growth expected to moderate in 2024, and the potential for recession lingering, dividends may take a more prominent role in driving total returns for investors.\u201d\n\nWhile many major companies pay dividends on a quarterly basis, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends to shareholders. 11 Best Stocks That Pay Monthly Dividends in 2024\n\nPhoto by Dan Dennis on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nFor this list, we reviewed companies providing monthly dividends to their shareholders.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2024 report, just over 5% of the global workforce is currently unemployed. While this figure represents an improvement compared to the pre-pandemic era, the outlook remains uncertain, with an anticipated additional two million individuals expected to seek employment within the next year. Concurrently, the global economy faces its slowest growth period in three decades, as indicated by a recent World Bank report.\n\nNotably, the disparity in economic circumstances persists between higher and lower income countries, with joblessness rates significantly higher in poorer nations. Despite efforts to address challenges such as inflation and informal employment, income inequality continues to widen, posing obstacles to achieving sustained economic recovery and social justice, according to ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo.\n\nSpeaking of recovery, in 2022 and early 2023, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) experienced major layoffs, affecting tens of thousands of employees. The company seemed to be transitioning into a period of austerity, marked by reduced teams, tighter budgets, and fewer perks. However, within a few months,\u00a0 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s trajectory took a sharp turn as it announced plans for robust hiring in 2024.\n\nDespite the recent layoffs,\u00a0 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) anticipates sizable growth in its workforce and payroll expenses to support priority areas, particularly focusing on higher-cost technical roles. Additionally,\u00a0 Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) aims to invest heavily in groundbreaking tech initiatives, such as the development of the \"metaverse,\" which includes augmented and virtual reality ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s reversal in hiring strategy reflects a broader trend among tech giants. Companies like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), after huge layoffs, are now embarking on large-scale rehiring endeavors, particularly in critical divisions such as engineering and data cloud. This resurgence in hiring confirms the demand for tech professionals with sought-after skills, even amidst economic fluctuations.\n\nWith an aim to increase the competitiveness and employability of the youth, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)\u2019s $5 million Pathways to Readiness and Empowerment Program (PREP) has entered its third year, targeting the growth of career opportunities for over 3,000 youth from Chicago's South and West Sides. Since its inception in 2021, PREP has impacted over 2,200 young individuals, offering career exposure, paid internships, credentialing, and full-time employment opportunities. This year, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)\u2019s reaffirms its commitment by awarding $250,000 to various local nonprofits, including Imagine Englewood if, Girls in the Game, and Southwest Organizing Project, among others.\n\nOne notable partnership is with Ladies of Virtue (LOV), which empowers girls in underserved areas, with a 100% college acceptance rate among its high school seniors. PepsiCo, Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) collaborated with LOV, providing funding for STEM-focused internships and career exploration experiences. Additionally, the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP) has started a workforce program that aims to enroll 100 community members annually, projecting an annual income gain of $4 million reinvested into the community.\n\nPepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)\u2019 2024 National Hiring Day initiative also seeks to promote its Canadian workforce by recruiting over 800 individuals. Positions range from Warehouse Workers to sales representatives, dispersed across cities such as Calgary, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa. Successful applicants stand to earn up to $15,000, making it a potentially lucrative opportunity.\n\nDespite training initiatives around the globe, AI is set to revolutionize the global economy, with nearly 40% of jobs worldwide facing its impact, either through replacement or augmentation. While advanced economies stand to benefit from AI's integration, they also face heightened risks, with approximately 60% of their jobs vulnerable. In contrast, emerging markets and low-income countries face fewer immediate disruptions but lack the infrastructure and skilled workforce to fully capitalize on AI's potential.\n\nThe advent of AI introduces the potential for increased income and wealth inequality within countries. Those able to harness AI may see an increase in productivity and wages, leaving others behind. Without proactive policies to address these disparities, AI could exacerbate existing social tensions. To mitigate these risks, comprehensive social safety nets and retraining programs are essential to ensure a more inclusive transition to an AI-driven world. 25 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World\n\nA headshot collage of employees indicating the company's diversity and innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the countries with the highest employment rates in the world, we relied on OECD\u2019s Employment Rates (Total, % of working age population).

It is one of the countries with the highest minimum wage in the world.\n\n16. Finland\n\nEmployment Rate in Q3 2023: 73.86\n\nWhile the country is one of the countries with the highest employment rates, Finland faces a mounting worker shortage in crucial sectors like healthcare and construction, prompting a proactive approach in recruiting skilled professionals globally. With increasing interest from abroad, Finland received 7,343 applications for work and residence permits in early 2023.\n\n15. Austria\n\nEmployment Rate in Q3 2023: 74.00\n\nWhile it is one of the countries with highest employment rates, Austria still plans to attract over 15,000 skilled workers annually from non-EU countries by 2027 through the Red-White-Red Card system.

        "title": "Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) For Its Upcoming Dividend",
        "content": "It looks like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 29th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of April.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$1.265 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.06 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, PepsiCo has a trailing yield of approximately 3.0% on its current stock price of US$169.60. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.\n\nView our latest analysis for PepsiCo\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. PepsiCo paid out more than half (75%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out 84% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nStory continues historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nWhen earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see PepsiCo's earnings per share have dropped 5.7% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, PepsiCo has lifted its dividend by approximately 8.3% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHas PepsiCo got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least PepsiCo's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. Bottom line: PepsiCo has some unfortunate characteristics that we think could lead to sub-optimal outcomes for dividend investors.\n\nWith that being said, if you're still considering PepsiCo as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with PepsiCo and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

        "title": "Food companies detail 3 big trends in packaged goods right now",
        "content": "Major food companies are setting the table for investors.\n\nAt the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference in Boca Raton, Fla., major packaged food brands with enticing dividend payouts such as PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), Hershey's (HSY), Conagra Brands (CAG), and Molson Coors (TAP) presented updates to their businesses. Some even offered unexpected twists to their strategies.\n\nThe overarching story from food companies centered on a return to normal. After a year of Ozempic fears settling in, a pullback in consumer spending amid higher prices, and a few lingering post-COVID supply chain issues, food execs were eager to move the narrative forward.\n\nBarring any further disruptions in 2024, one common theme from food companies was staying on track, Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance. \"This is the first year now in probably three or four where you're sort of operating in normalized conditions. ... So I think [they have] a lot of hope that [they're] going to be in a stable environment.\"\n\nWith the conference set to run through Friday, here are some other trends Yahoo Finance noticed on the ground. The Pop-Tarts mascot, Strawberry, poses for a photo before the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Thursday, Dec. 28, 2023, at Camping World Stadium, Orlando, Fla. (Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) (Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nAll eyes on volume\n\nFood execs are focused on volume recovery, as Americans have scaled back how much they're buying because of high prices.\n\nLeaders at General Mills (GIS) and Conagra were \"hesitant to comment on whether fiscal 2025 (beginning in June) could be a return to growth in line with long-term targets,\" Evercore ISI analyst David Palmer wrote in a note to clients from the event.\n\nHershey and Mondel\u0113z (MDLZ) called out \"price pack architecture,\" which uses different sizes and price points, as a potential growth lever. \"We've always capitalized on having different price points, different pack sizes, so that there's accessibility for everyone,\" Hershey CEO Michele Buck said to the crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, WK Kellogg Co is taking a different approach by providing value through nutrition, an idea that CEO Gary Pilnick believes will stick around.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe go through different business cycles, we go through different fads, different nutrition demands,\" Pilnick said. \"There's something in [each of those trends] for cereal.\" Various types of Kellogg's cereals are pictured at a Ralphs grocery store in Pasadena, Calif., Aug. 3, 2015. (Mario Anzuoni/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIn the fourth quarter, WK Kellogg's revenue decreased by 2.7%, reflecting a 10% volume decline offset by price increases.\n\nPilnick explained that affordable protein sources open up a new frontier for the cereal maker, which spun off from Kellogg\u2019s snack business last year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he reiterated that cereal demand is \"durable\" as consumers\u2019 preferences change.\n\nPilnick added that a focus on nutrition also unlocks the premium market for WK Kellogg too, as shown by the company's Eat Your Mouth Off brand, a granola-like cereal that boasts plant-based protein and zero sugar.\n\nInnovating with new flavors, packaging, and marketing\n\nReimagining classics was another key strategy execs pointed to.\n\nThey held up flavor innovation as one tactic. WK Kellogg's Pilnick said the company saw success bringing back customers with new strawberry Frosted Flakes and the return of chocolate Frosted Flakes. J.M. Smucker Co.'s slide from its presentation at CAGNY 2024 teased a new flavor that will be added to the Uncrustables lineup in September. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nMeanwhile, J.M. Smucker (SJM) said it's adding raspberry Uncrustables to its lineup in September 2024 as it aims to deliver $800 million in net sales for its Uncrustables brand this fiscal year. The new flavor is part of a larger effort to lean into \"a flavor for every day of the week.\"\n\nThe company also announced its JIF peanut butter brand will launch a peanut butter and chocolate spread this summer. \"Over 70% of peanut butter buyers are not purchasing a chocolate-flavor spread today, and we anticipate this innovation will be highly incremental to the brand,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said.\n\nPackaging innovation offers another opportunity. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has invested in updating its packaging for \u201cportion control\u201d and \u201cportability\u201d as customers snack more throughout the day. PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Luis Laguarta presents at CAGNY 2024. (Yahoo Finance)\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that consumers can find us in many more occasions,\u201d he said. Pepsi is also leaning into powders and tablets, \u201cgiving consumers the opportunity to find Gatorade or to use Gatorade in a much different way.\u201d\n\nFood giants are also reengaging consumers through marketing campaigns with new partners.\n\nHershey, for example, excited the CAGNY conference crowd by bringing in NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal to announce a partnership to \u201cwin\u201d in the gummy segment, the fastest-growing sweets segment. Conagra Brands, meanwhile, shared that Dolly Parton's baking line is expanding into frozen shelves.\n\nCompanies are looking for partnerships beyond grocery store shelves too. They're eager to tap into the market for dining away from home, which has seen prices continue to grow.\n\nFor instance, did you know McCormick (MKC) launched a limited-time offering with McDonald's (MCD) in February for the McSpicy sandwich in the UK with Frank's RedHot sauce? Or that it teamed up with Wendy's (WEN) to launch a breakfast burrito served with Cholula hot sauce?\n\n\u201cWe're excited to continue to leverage our brands and our hot and spicy flavors to further penetrate menus and add the heat in away-from-home channels,\u201d McCormick CFO Michael Smith said.\n\nThe buzz around M&A\n\nWhile no major announcements were made, many companies teased that they're open to dealmaking but are waiting for the right company to come along.\n\nWK Kellogg's Pilnick said potential targets \"would likely be [in the] center of the food business where our brands would resonate because you'd get cost synergies.\" However, he noted that WK Kellogg is not focused on M&A right now.\n\nMondel\u0113z CEO Dirk Van de Put gave investors insight into its M&A process. The company begins by building relationships with about 30 to 40 companies, most of which are family-owned, making gaining trust on both sides crucial.\n\n\"We can't forecast the timetable, but what I can say is that the pipeline is active,\" Van de Put said. Deals are getting \u201cmore expensive because there's more interest,\" he added. \"We want to stay very disciplined.\"\n\nHowever, the next major food deal may not be a traditional acquisition.\n\nMizuho's Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance that investors could see deals similar to Walmart's acquisition of Vizio, in which \"food staples companies [acquire] differentiated tech companies\" to gain a deeper understanding of consumers.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "2 Top Dividend Stocks That Just Hiked Their Payouts",
        "content": "Investors can often see them coming weeks in advance, but the specific amount of a given annual dividend hike is always a surprise. That's because so much goes into management's decision about this payout boost, beyond simply the most recent growth and earnings performance.\n\nPepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) and Home Depot(NYSE: HD) each announced new dividend payment rates as part of their Q4 earnings updates in February. Let's look at what these moves say about the business of these two companies and whether the dividend stocks are buys today.\n\n1. PepsiCo\n\nPepsiCo recently ended a solid year on a down note. Organic sales gains in the Q4 period slowed to a 5% year-over-year increase from 9% in the prior quarter, and investors are bracing for further sluggishness ahead. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team say that sales will rise by just 4% in 2024 compared to last year's 10% spike.\n\nDemand trends in the beverage and snack food niches are slowing back down to the pre-pandemic pace after several years of above-average growth, but Pepsi's dividend is still well covered by its ample earnings and cash flow. The company generated $13 billion of operating cash last year, up from $11 billion in 2022. That success was powered by improving efficiency and rising prices. \"We are pleased with our results for 2023,\" Laguarta said in early February.\n\nPepsi's 7% dividend boost is covered by the expected 8% earnings increase in 2024. It's true that the hike marked a slowdown compared to last year's 10% dividend boost. Yet income investors should still be happy with the rising payout. Pepsi is among the most consistent dividend stocks on the market when it comes to annual raises. The 2024 boost was its 52nd consecutive annual hike.\n\n2. Home Depot\n\nA lot has changed since late February of 2023, when Home Depot announced its 10% dividend hike. Consumer spending slowed in the home improvement market as interest rates jumped and the housing market contracted. That pressure shows up most directly in Home Depot's comparable-store sales, which fell 3% on the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe good news is customer traffic trends improved to a 3% drop from a 5% decline in 2022. However, average spending rates were down this past year as do-it-yourself shoppers canceled or delayed their home investment projects. It didn't help that lumber prices collapsed year over year, either.\n\nYet Home Depot's management team is still optimistic about the next several years. Operating profit margin is projected to hold above 14% of sales in 2024, putting the metric near the pandemic record of about 15% of sales. But with earnings on pace to decline for a second straight year, how could Home Depot afford to boost its dividend by 8% in 2024?\n\nThe short answer is cash flow. Home Depot became much more efficient last year as management adjusted to slowing sales trends. That explains how operating cash flow jumped to $21 billion from $15 billion on the year. This success allowed it to spend more on its dividend and stock buybacks without harming its financial position. HD Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nHome Depot has a more diversified business than rival Lowe's, which doesn't generate as much revenue from the professional contractor niche. That difference, combined with its market-leading industry position, should allow the chain to keep winning share even in a tough selling environment. Investors can consequently expect many more years of dividend increases ahead, powered by that diverse business.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Home Depot wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "The 'No Lay's, No Game' platform is back with an in-stadium \"Chip Cam\" stunt you have to see to believe, new \"Lay's Detector\" technology, and much more \u2013 rewarding fans who are game-day-ready with Lay's!\n\nPURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Do you have Lay's? Well, this seemingly simple question could lead to unexpected rewards, at unexpected moments, and sometimes by unexpected people. Lay's, the world's number one chip brand and official snack partner of the\u00a0UEFA Champions League (UCL), has launched No Lay's, No Game 2024, rewarding fans who are game day ready with Lay's throughout the tournament. Through an ambitious \"Chip Cam\" stunt featuring soccer superstars David Beckham and Thierry Henry, as well as an immersive digital experience with the Lay's Detector, Lay's is delivering joy to football fans around the globe who watch the beautiful game with Lay's in hand. No Lay's, No Game Badge\n\n\"We've heard from soccer fans from all over the world and they tell us the same thing: whether watching with a group of friends or at home solo, the experience is always better when sharing a bag of Lay's,\" said Ciara Dilley, vice president of marketing, Global Foods Group at PepsiCo. \"This year, No Lay's, No Game is giving fans even more reasons to have Lay's in hand. For those who do, something truly remarkable might happen. And those who don't? They may be left missing out.\"\n\nThis year, Lay's took a bold approach to its campaign and invited Beckham and Henry to ask, \"Do you have Lay's?\" to a crowd of 75,000 cheering fans at San Siro during one of the most anticipated matches of the UEFA Champions League season between AC Milan and PSG. Just before kick-off, Beckham discovered, and couldn't believe, that Henry had eaten all of his Lay's chips. To solve it in just five minutes, the two put out a call through the Lay's \"Chip Cam\" \u2013 an unexpected spin on the traditional kiss cam.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn what turns out to be a nail-biting, yet humorous, search for someone with Lay's, the Chip Cam scans the crowd. Beckham and Henry see spectators offering up items on the jumbotron \u2013 like pizzas, empty Lay's bags, even a couple kissing \u2013 desperate to be selected. Finally, to Beckham and Henry's delight, two lucky fans, a father and daughter,\u00a0are found with Lay's and are invited to watch the game with the iconic soccer stars\u00a0\u2013 proving having\u00a0Lay's can unlock a truly mind-blowing soccer-watching\u00a0experience. This epic hunt to find fans with Lay's \u2013 and opening the door to a once-in-a-lifetime viewing experience for the lucky winners \u2013 serves as the main feature of this year's No Lay's, No Game commercial and will air throughout the UCL tournament season.\n\n\"We had a great day filming at the San Siro stadium for No Lay's, No Game. Whenever Thierry and I get together it's always a lot of fun \u2013 and it was fantastic being able to surprise 75,000 fans,\" said Beckham.\n\n\"Last year, I teamed up with Lay's to surprise some of soccer's biggest fans by literally going to their doors to see if they had Lay's \u2013 and if they did, I stayed and watched the match with them,\" said Henry. \"This year, we really upped the ante with the Lay's Chip Cam, and it was truly an exhilarating experience being back in the stadium with David. We spent a lot of our careers playing against each other on the field, so there's something special about coming together with Lay's in a whole new way to offer a once in a lifetime experience for fans.\"\n\nThe campaign was created in partnership with Slap Global and directed by award-winning commercial and television director Andrew Lane.\n\nAnd while not everyone could be in the stands of San Siro, Lay's is bringing No Lay's No Game home. In partnership with Meta, Lay's has created the Lay's Detector, a unique digital experience that unlocks the chance to win exciting prizes for football fans in select countries around the world now through the end of the UCL tournament. How? Fans must prove they have Lay's with them while watching a game.

Then, fans will be prompted to verify that they have Lay's with them \u2013 and if they do, they will be entered to win exclusive prizing, content and even tickets to the UCL Men's Finals at Wembley Stadium in London. And if they don't have Lay's? Not to worry, fans will have more chances to show off their bag of Lay's to win epic prizes throughout the rest of the season.\n\nU.S. residents can access the Lay's Detector on Lay's Instagram and Facebook. Fans outside the U.S. can check their local Lay's Instagram and Facebook pages for more information.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 2023-2024 Men's and Women's UEFA Champions League tournaments, fans should look out for more exciting and unexpected moments from No Lay's, No Game.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S. If you want to skip our overview of the global energy drink industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at 5 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US.\n\nFor decades humans have been discovering ways to enhance their performance. Whether its academia, business, sports, or medicine, the use of both natural and synthetic substances is common to alter the chemistry of the human body. Natural substances such as coffee power up global workforces to an extent that America's biggest coffee chain, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), is worth a whopping $105 billion on the stock market. Similarly, anabolic steroids are some of the most watched out substances when it comes to high performance sports such as basketball, weight lifting, or football.\n\nHowever, while most coffee requires milk and steroids require a prescription, another commonly consumed drink by truckers and college students alike is an energy drink. Energy drinks come in a variety of flavors and variants, and they can be stocked well in advance to allow 'binge' drinking for the really ambitious. Some common substances found in energy drinks are caffeine and taurine, with the latter often being exclusive to energy drinks or other carbonated beverages instead of being also found in, say, coffee.\n\nOver the years, the global energy drink industry has also grown from being limited to a few players to seeing greater focus from big players such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). With market capitalizations of $258 billion and $228 billion, they are among the biggest companies in the world that demonstrate that no matter how popular coffee is, at the end of the day a diversified business model can cater to tight consumer budgets during an economic contraction are still perceived to be worth more by both professional and retail investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet one of the most popular energy drink brands in the world, i.e. Red Bull, is private. Red Bull's advertisement campaigns have seen it associate its brand name with high risk activities such as the highest altitude parachute jump in the world and customized sports car racing, and when compared to its American counterpart Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), it can be safely assumed that Red Bull has a far greater brand reach.\n\nDelving deeper into the current performance and environment of the energy drink industry, these companies tend to thrive the most when consumers have more money to spend. After all, while energy drinks are popular, they still are not essential daily use products such as toilet paper and toothpaste. However, they cannot be purely classified as cyclical either, especially since a lot of energy drink users consume them daily and might skip out on other purchases to keep up their consumption during tough economic times. As an example, consider research published in the BMC Public Health journal. It used data from 266 commercial bus drivers, a physically intensive job that can require hours of sustained concentration to safely operate a vehicle to show that 32% of the drivers drank seven to ten bottles of energy drinks a week - or more than one bottle a day. Additionally, three quarters believed that drinking energy drinks would improve their work performance, and the majority were unaware of any adverse health effects.\n\nShifting towards the corporate side of things, a brief look at the latest financial results of Monster Beverage and Celsius Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CELH) is warranted. Both of them had missed analyst EPS estimates for their fourth quarter of 2022 financials, but since then, they have either met or beaten them. During the third quarter of 2023, Celsius's revenue grew by a whopping 104% annually to sit at $385 million. The corresponding press release highlighted that these gains came on the back of an improved logistics chain that increased product availability and allowed the firm to drive up sales. Monster, a bigger company, also marked revenue growth during the quarter, as its revenue grew by 14.3% to sit at $1.86 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the firm's management shared during the earnings conference:\n\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until the end of September 2023, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.6% to 18.4% in Germany, Monster\u2019s retail market share in value as compared to the same period of the previous year remained flat at 31.6% in Italy, Monster\u2019s retail market share value as compared to the same period the previous year declined from 19% to 18.4% in Poland and from 19.8% to 17.9% in South Africa.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S. 10 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US\n\nPixabay / Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the ten fastest growing energy drink stocks in the U.S., we ranked the 12 stocks part of our coverage of the 12 Biggest Energy Drink Stocks in the US and tertiary energy drink stocks by their five year or all time share price performance.

        "content": "Beyond Meat (BYND) is aiming to give investors better news to digest in 2024.\n\nTo do that, it unveiled its \"Beyond IV\" product line on Wednesday.\n\nThe company is taking the wraps off new plant-based patties and ground beef that use avocado oil as the star ingredient while execs fire back at critics of the product's historically high fat and sodium counts.\n\nBeyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown told Yahoo Finance that his team wanted to create products that are \"unassailable from a health perspective.\" Beyond Meat's newest products use avocado oil as the company looks to reduce criticism from those in the food industry. (Beyond Meat) (Beyond Meat)\n\nBeyond Meat says the shift to avocado oil alone has reduced the saturated fat count by 60% compared to the previous version of its plant-based beef. Prior iterations used a combination of canola oil and refined coconut oil.\n\nThe company claims its new patty, which will start arriving at retailers soon, contains 14 grams of total fat (the same amount as the prior version) and 2 grams of saturated fat (compared to 5 grams previously) per serving. It also claims to have reduced the sodium count by 20%.\n\nOther new ingredients include red lentil and faba bean protein. Previously, the company used a mixture of pea and rice proteins. Overall, Beyond Meat said it reduced the number of ingredients for the products.\n\nThe company was also able to secure a label from the American Heart Association (AHA) that marks the product as a \"heart-healthy recipe.\"\n\n\"It takes the product from relative health claims like 'this is healthy' to an absolute health claim \u2014 'this is a healthy, delicious product,'\" Brown told Yahoo Finance on a Zoom call from inside the company's El Segundo, Calif., headquarters. A staff member displays a burger with a Beyond Meat plant-based patty at VeggieWorld fair in Beijing, China, on Nov. 8, 2019. (Jason Lee/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA reset for Beyond Meat\n\nBrown is no doubt hoping an avocado-centric patty and ground beef substitute \u2014 which could redefine the plant-based meat industry \u2014 is akin to hitting the reset button on what has been a challenging two years.\n\nThe challenges have centered around a consumer debate over whether plant-based meat is healthier than regular meat. Critics have pointed to plant-based meat's high sodium and saturated fat counts.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, the industry's products, along with packaged foods more broadly, have also gotten dinged for being processed and potentially not heart-healthy \u2014 a label that PepsiCo (PEP) chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta told Yahoo Finance Live isn't accurate.\n\nTo be sure, a reset moment is needed with customers and investors, given the raw optics of the company's financials and the state of the industry at large.\n\nIn November of last year, Beyond Meat said it would slash 19% of its non-production workforce after a softer-than-expected third quarter. Third quarter sales fell 8.7% from the prior year to $75.3 million. The company lost $57.5 million on an adjusted operating profit basis.\n\nBeyond Meat is slated to report its fourth quarter and full-year results on Feb. 27, and the Street is bracing for more of the same. Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown acknowledged that the plant-based meat company has been battling weaker sentiment around its products.\n\nAnalysts expect Beyond Meat to report $66.7 million in sales for the fourth quarter of 2023, down 17.4% year over year. In last year's fourth quarter, Beyond Meat's sales dropped 20.6% year over year.\n\nThe company is expected to report a fourth quarter adjusted loss of $0.88 a share, compared to a loss of $1.05 a share a year ago.\n\nFor all of 2023, market research firm Mintel estimated that the size of the plant-based meat market fell 3.6% year over year to $1.46 billion.\n\n\"[Beyond Meat] as a whole continues to suffer under the weight of depressed demand in the US for plant-based meat,\" JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a recent client note. \"We don\u2019t have visibility at this time into when the trend bottoms.\"\n\nSubsequently, the market has taken a large bite out of the valuation of Beyond Meat.\n\nThe stock changed hands at $7.18 a share as of the market close on Tuesday, down 60% over the past year.\n\nRecall that the company priced its May 2019 IPO at $25 a share, opened for trading at $46, and then surged to $65.75 by the close. The gain when that closing bell sounded was a mouth-watering 163%.\n\nBy July 2019, shares of Beyond Meat hit a peak of $234.90 a share amid a flurry of deals with fast-food chains like KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, which are owned by Yum! Brands (YUM).\n\n\"Management is pursuing a 'kitchen sink' approach (innovation, promo, marketing) to combat a swift change in consumption habits,\" Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawalawrote in a recent client note. \"It is unclear when trends will stabilize. Low demand visibility makes right-sizing operations necessary.\"\n\nBrown thinks the worst is, well, beyond Beyond Meat.\n\n\"I do think [the new products are] an accelerant for the reinvention of the category,\" Brown said.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Collaboration with Community-Based Organizations Expand Workforce Resources and Drive Economic Mobility\n\nCHICAGO, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Building on its more than 100-year history in Chicago, local employer PepsiCo is entering the third year of its $5 million Pathways to Readiness and Empowerment Program (PREP), which aims to advance career opportunities for at least 3,000 youth from the South and West Sides. Since launching PREP in 2021, PepsiCo has invested in grassroots organizations that provide career resources to more than 2,200 youth and young adults through career exposure, paid internships, credentialing and full-time employment.

PepsiCo's engagement with LOV is multidimensional, including funding to LOV distributed as stipends to high school students in STEM-focused internships at the Field Museum and a co-designed career exploration experience with PepsiCo that included a pitch contest in which students proposed new product ideas to a panel of leaders at the company's downtown headquarters.\n\n\"Financial support for local organizations on the South and West Sides has decreased, while community needs persist,\" said Jamila Trimuel, the founder of Ladies of Virtue. \"Our dedication is unwavering, but additional support is crucial. Partners like PepsiCo are game changers and their value goes beyond dollars. We count on partners to tackle challenges together and sustain their commitment in order to create lasting wins for our youth.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSouthwest Organizing Project (SWOP)--a broad-based organization of 43 member\u00a0institutions--pioneered a workforce program that opens doors to high-quality career opportunities, reaching 200 community members with employment, career training, interview and resume support, and youth internships in 2023 with PepsiCo seed funding. SWOP anticipates enrolling approximately 100 neighbors into the career program annually which they estimate will result in $4 million each year in income gained through direct employment being invested back into the community and improving the quality of life for Southwest Chicago residents.\n\n\"Working day in and day out with our community partners, I see firsthand the positive impact these groups have in people's lives,\" said Brittany\u00a0N.

        "title": "3 Passive Income Stocks You Can Consider Buying Today",
        "content": "Investing in blue-chip dividend stocks can help you generate a recurring stream of passive income at a low cost. Here, you need to identify quality large-cap companies that thrive across market cycles and generate steady cash flows. Generally, blue-chip companies allocate a portion of these cash flows to shareholders in the form of dividends. Further, these companies increase dividends annually each year, enhancing the effective yield over time.\n\nThree such companies that can help you generate passive income include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). I am bullish on each of these stocks due to their strong brands, predictable earnings, and steady, growing dividends.\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO)\n\nValued at $256 billion by market cap, Coca-Cola is among the most recognizable brands in the world. It is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of non-alcoholic beverages. In the last 20 years, Coca-Cola\u2019s stock has returned 133% to shareholders. But after adjusting for dividends, total returns are closer to 323%. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) has returned 538% after adjusting for dividends.\n\nWhile Coca-Cola has underperformed the broader market, it has still outpaced inflation over the long term. Moreover, the stock is much less volatile than the S&P 500 Index, with a beta of less than 0.6. A beta of less than 1.0 suggests low relative volatility for a particular stock.\n\nDespite its massive size, Coca-Cola increased its sales from $33 billion in 2020 to $43 billion in 2022. In 2023, its sales increased to $45.75 billion. Comparatively, operating income has risen from $9 billion in 2020 to nearly $11 billion in 2022 and $11.3 billion in 2023.\n\nCoca-Cola pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $1.94 per share, indicating a forward yield of 3.3%. In the last 20 years, Coca-Cola has increased its dividends at an annual rate of 7.3%.\n\nCoca-Cola continues to gain market share in the beverage segment and ended 2023 with free cash flow of $9.7 billion. Its payout ratio has ranged around 75%, providing it with enough room to strengthen the balance sheet, reinvest in capital expenditures, and increase its dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for Coca-Cola Stock?\n\nOut of the 14 analysts tracking Coca-Cola, 10 recommend Buying, and four recommend Holding. There are no Sell recommendations for KO stock. The average KO stock price target is $65.79, indicating upside potential of 10.8% from current levels.\n\nPepsi (NASDAQ:PEP)\n\nValued at $229 billion by market cap, Pepsi is a direct competitor to Coca-Cola. Its portfolio of brands other than Pepsi includes Cheetos, Gatorade, Lay\u2019s, and Mountain Dew, among others. Pepsi currently pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $5.06 per share, indicating a yield of 3%.\n\nMoreover, the company has raised the payouts for 52 consecutive years, which is remarkable. In the last 20 years, Pepsi has grown its dividends by more than 10% annually.\n\nIn recent years, Pepsi has increased product prices to offset inflation, showcasing its pricing power. However, due to a sluggish macro environment, Pepsi expects sales to grow by just 4% year-over-year in 2024, lower than consensus estimates of 5.2%.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for Pepsi Stock?\n\nOut of the 16 analysts covering PEP stock, nine recommend a Buy, seven recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average Pepsi stock price target is $189.44, 13.9% above the current price.\n\nProcter & Gamble Stock (NYSE:PG)\n\nThe final dividend stock on my list is Procter & Gamble, valued at $370 billion. Operating in the branded consumer packaged goods segment, Procter & Gamble is a household name and operates in multiple verticals, such as beauty, healthcare, and family care, among others.\n\nSimilar to other companies, P&G is struggling with tepid consumer spending amid higher interest rates and inflation. Despite these headwinds, P&G saw its earnings grow by 16% in the October-to-December quarter due to cost savings and price hikes.\n\nThe company expects organic sales to grow between 4% and 5% in 2024, compared to a 7% increase in 2023. P&G\u2019s focus on cost optimization should drive earnings and dividends higher from here.\n\nP&G pays shareholders an annualized dividend of $3.76 per share, indicating a forward yield of 2.4%. These payouts have increased by 7.6% annually in the last 20 years.\n\nWhat Is the Target Price for PG Stock?\n\nOut of the 16 analysts covering PG stock, 10 recommend a Buy, six recommend a Hold, and none recommend a Sell, giving it a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average PG stock price target is $167.93, 6.6% above the current price.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nPassive income investors can consider investing in large-cap dividend stocks. In addition to the dividend yield, investors are also positioned to benefit from long-term capital gains.\n\nGiven the average yield of 2.8% for these three stocks, an investment of $5,000 in each of these dividend giants will help you earn $420 in annual dividends. In case the payouts increase by 7% each year, your dividends will double in the next 10 years.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "1 Growth Stock Down 14% to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Growth stocks are rarely available at a discount, and that's especially true after a strong stock market rally like the one that investors have seen in the past year. Yet while tech growth stocks have soared, Wall Street's enthusiasm hasn't carried over to less-popular industry niches like retailing and consumer staples.\n\nPatient investors should consider taking advantage of that glaring oversight. Let's look at why you might want to put PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) in your portfolio following its decline since last Spring.\n\nA good deal\n\nThe stock is down 14% since mid-May, even as the wider S&P 500 index jumped 20% higher. That shift has made PepsiCo cheaper by a few key valuation metrics.\n\nYou can own the diversified snack and beverage giant for 2.5x sales, down from the over 3x sales that investors have been paying through most of the past several years. The same is true for Pepsi's price-to-earnings ratio, which sits at 27 today, compared to a 2023 high of around 40.\n\nPepsi's discount reflects the somewhat challenging times that the business is facing right now. In early February, management forecast slower growth in 2024 after several years of above-average demand spikes.\n\nIt turns out that consumers are a bit less excited to stock up on snacks and beverages for at-home consumption these days, so demand growth is slowing back down to normal. And there's less need for price hikes in 2024 as inflation gets back under control. That's another drag on Pepsi's core organic sales metric.\n\nYet the outlook is still positive around top-line sales growth and even better with respect to earnings. Pepsi's management is calling for net profits to rise at a significantly faster pace than sales for a second straight year, thus expanding the company's profit margins. Earnings should improve by at least 8%, management predicts, or double the sales growth rate.\n\nCash flow and cash returns\n\nShareholders will also benefit from Pepsi's ample cash flow that's powering higher direct cash returns to investors. Operating cash flow was $13 billion in the past full year, up from $11 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues PEP Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nAs a result, investors can expect to receive just over $8 billion of direct cash returns in 2024, split between $1 billion in stock buybacks and $7.2 billion in dividend payments. Pepsi is generating all this cash with help from positive trends such as price increases, cost cuts, and its growing global sales footprint. Success on these fronts gave management confidence to boost the annual dividend by 7% on top of last year's 10% increase.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nManagement believes it has the right growth strategy in place, which relies on innovative product releases in the snack-food segment and a push deeper into high-growth areas in the beverage niche. Pepsi is especially excited about drinks that are outside of its core soda brands including water, sports drinks, and energy drinks.\n\n\"We are pleased with our results for 2023 as we successfully navigated another year of elevated levels of inflation, macroeconomic volatility, geopolitical tensions, and international conflicts,\" CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a press release. \"We are confident that our businesses will perform well in 2024 in the context of changing market conditions.\"\n\nInvestors will want to watch those changing conditions, which will likely result in a period of slower sales growth, as compared to the past few years. Yet thanks to that short-term pessimism, you can own the consumer staples stock at an attractive discount. Considering its potential for good long-term growth plus rising cash flow, Pepsi stock seems worth considering as a buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and PepsiCo wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 16 best income stocks to buy according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of income-generating stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nDividends have played a significant role in the overall returns of the S&P 500 since 1930, contributing approximately 40% of the total return. However, during periods of high inflation, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, when inflation rates averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, around 54% of the total return. This insight came from Naveed Rahman, who serves as a co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy. The Fidelity report further elaborated on the performance of dividend stocks during inflationary periods, highlighting that during the 1930s and 2000s when the stock prices of the S&P 500 declined, dividends nearly offset those losses. Moreover, in the 1940s and 1970s, characterized by significant inflation spikes, dividends contributed substantially to the S&P 500's return, accounting for 65% and 71% respectively.\n\nDividend-paying stocks have become a cornerstone of many individual investor portfolios due to their ability to generate substantial income over time. This income component is essential as it can significantly contribute to the overall return on investment, helping investors achieve the necessary portfolio growth to meet their financial goals. A study conducted by Eagle Investment Management sheds light on the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the income generated by a theoretical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, consisting of companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years, with the broader S&P 500 Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. According to the report, the initial investment of $1,000,000 in 2012 in the dividend aristocrats would have generated an income of $93,212 by 2022. In contrast, the income from the same investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have been $55,726. This stark difference highlights the significant income potential offered by dividend aristocrats compared to the broader market index. Although historical, this example serves to demonstrate the importance of not just prioritizing dividends but also considering the growth of dividends. This dual focus is crucial for enhancing a portfolio's income stream gradually over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThroughout the years, stocks belonging to companies that begin and consistently increase their dividend payouts have shown superior performance compared to the overall market. Conversely, stocks of companies that reduce or fail to pay dividends have notably underperformed. According to findings from a report by RMB Capital, from 1972 to 2018, dividend-growing companies and those initiating dividends delivered an average annual return of 9.62%, while stocks of companies cutting dividends experienced a negative return of 0.79%. During this period, non-dividend companies returned 2.40%, significantly underperforming dividend growers.\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)\u00a0are considered some of the best dividend stocks for regular income as these companies hold strong dividend growth track records.

EPS came in at 54 cents. Better, Intel is expanding its semiconductor and foundry business which will pay off in the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIntel is a well-known name in the industry which has had its fair share of troubles.

It also posted a total payment volume of $1.5 trillion in 2023. Revenue was up 9% to hit $8 billion, as EPS jumped 19% year over year to $1.48 per share. However, despite the strong numbers, analysts are concerned about the company\u2019s long-term growth, which led to a drop in the stock.\n\nIn addition, while management did provide a weaker-than-expected growth forecast, investors should keep in mind that PayPal is a massive business that already has an edge in the industry.

It enjoys a strong market position, is a dividend aristocrat, and enjoys high brand loyalty.\n\nMost recently, Coca-Cola posted mixed earnings results. EPS came in at 49 cents, as revenue stood at $10.85 billion. Sales were up year over year, but it was mainly due to the higher prices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. I\u2019m not too concerned, though. A dip in sales volume for one quarter doesn\u2019t reflect its potential. Plus, if you enjoy passive income, KO is a good bet.\n\nAt the moment, KO yields 3.1% and should continue rewarding investors for years.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been in a downward trend for the past six months and has lost 22% of its value. All thanks to declining revenue from its Covid-19 vaccine. However, I believe the correction is overdone.\n\nThere is so much more to Pfizer than the vaccine, and it has nine new molecular approvals by the FDA which has set the tone for 2024. It has a massive pipeline of drugs that are progressing in different phases, and the company is aiming for growth in the range of 3% to 5% for 2024.\n\nIt recently completed the acquisition of Seagen, which will help the oncology pipeline, and we will see it impact the revenue in the coming years. Trading at $27 today, the stock is down from the high of $42 and is worth buying. It also brings a dividend yield of 6.11% which is one of the best in the industry.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) just reported a sales decline in its domestic and international markets.\n\nEPS came in at 90 cents while revenue stood at $9.43 billion, which was lower than market expectations. There is a perception that Starbucks supports Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war, and this has led to a boycott of the brand.\n\nIts second largest market, China also saw a 9% drop in sales. The company had to revise the sales outlook and this led to a dip in stock. SBUX stock is trading at $93 today and is very close to the 52-week low of $89.\n\nHowever, I believe the long-term picture still looks attractive.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) missed analyst expectations, which left investors disappointed.\n\nAccording to the company, a drop in revenue was due to the higher prices. Plus, consumers are looking for cheaper alternatives. However, the latest dip in the stock is a strong opportunity to buy. As consumer spending improves, Pepsi will regain its market, and we could see the stock soar.\n\nThis was a rare revenue miss and not something that could impact the company\u2019s long-term outlook. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 3.01% and is one rock-solid stock to buy and hold.\n\nDeere & Co. (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best blue-chip stocks to buy, Deere (NYSE:DE) is one of the best construction equipment manufacturers. Unfortunately, it\u2019s been suffering from supply chain issues.\n\nIt still managed to deliver strong growth in 2023 and saw a 42% rise in net income in the year. Trading at $364, DE stock is down 13% in the past six months and is just a little over the 52-week low of $345.\n\nThe company has solid potential to expand and it could benefit from the Infrastructure Investments & Jobs Act. It has a dividend yield of 1.61% and has steadily increased its quarterly dividends. It recently announced a 9% hike to the dividend despite an anticipated decline in earnings in 2024.\n\nDE might be down today, but the stock is a buy on dips.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nWelcome to the first theme change in markets for 2024.\n\nLet's call it, for argument's sake, the Great Reality Check.\n\nThe Great Reality Check has two components that lead to one conclusion for investors.\n\nComponent one is that we are stuck with sticky inflation at least through the first half of the year. That was confirmed in this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), both coming in above Wall Street estimates (notably the \"core\" readings).\n\nIt has also been confirmed by Corporate America, provided you are doing your daily due diligence.\n\nSo many companies have told the investing masses this earnings cycle that margins are still being hurt by high levels of inflation, including beverage giants PepsiCo (PEP) and Coca-Cola (KO), among others.\n\nThe second component is that the US economy is slowing down. Not falling off a cliff, but looking unlikely to spring a surprise upside in the near term.\n\nWhile Wall Street played down the soft retail sales report this week, I would push back and suggest consumers and businesses are growing more cautious.\n\nDiscretionary apparel companies VF Corp (VFC) and Levi's (LEVI) have laid eggs on earnings within the past two weeks.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) CEO Peter Kern told us on Yahoo Finance Live that travel demand in the first quarter has slowed, partially leading to his company's below-expected guidance last week. We got similar language from Airbnb (ABNB) on its earnings call this week and with its first quarter guidance.\n\nCisco (CSCO) said Thursday it would slash 5% of its workforce as it's seeing clients \u2014 such as telecom firms \u2014 delay new orders.\n\nElevator and escalator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS) told investors at a gathering at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that it projects new equipment sales to be flat to up low single digits in the \"medium term.\" (I will note Otis had a good investor day, outlining a new $8 billion capital return plan \u2014 more on that in my interview above with Otis chair and CEO Judy Marks.)\n\nStory continues In terms of the macro environment, we are seeing a greater degree of caution and scrutiny of deals given the high level of uncertainty... It's leading us to be more cautious with our forecast and expectations.\n\nOverall conclusion: Inflation is still on an upswing while economic growth is on a downswing, and Fed policy is caught in a vortex of being unable to cut rates to support growth acceleration.\n\nRemember it was just Jan. 1, 2024, when many on the Street thought March would bring the first of potentially six rate cuts this year.\n\nAnd there is your theme change, and why investors have reacted harshly to the inflation numbers. The mix of sticky inflation, slowing economic growth, and uncertain Fed policy will add volatility to both equities and fixed income markets.\n\n\"A solid economy should continue to support earnings growth, but higher rates will likely also serve to cap valuation expansion,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner said in a client note.\n\nSome basics questions to be asking right now:\n\nIs this the start of a market correction? If so, how should I be preparing my portfolio of investments? Is this all overblown and I should not make any drastic changes to my portfolio? How can I develop a diversified portfolio that withstands the inevitable market volatility in 2024? Are we getting a sampling of how the market will be reacting as Election Day gets closer?\n\nOf course, Nvidia (NVDA) could come out next week with earnings and blow everyone away, sending broader markets higher. In the meantime, the data is telling us things have changed \u2014 and it should be respected.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "The Nasdaq is off to a scorching start in 2024. The Nasdaq 100 Index is making new highs seemingly almost every week, and glamor stocks in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductors are blasting off.\n\nThis has left some investors worried about a potential bubble. There are definitely some significantly overvalued Nasdaq stocks out there. However, there are still quite a few good buys within the Nasdaq today. These three Nasdaq stocks to buy, in particular, offer good entry points right now.\n\nBruker (BRKR) Bruker sign and logo at office of manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research company\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBruker (NASDAQ:BRKR) is an interesting life sciences company. The firm is most known for its niche lab equipment, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy machines. Bruker has operated in these fields for decades and has a dominant market position for several of its key product lines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBruker saw a slowdown in sales over the last couple of years as various academic institutions and biotech firms reined in spending amid the pandemic and inflationary conditions. However, things are now normalizing, and Bruker announced excellent earnings results earlier this week.\n\nAdditionally, Bruker has another intriguing element. It has its Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies \u201cBEST\u201d division, which, while small, is rapidly growing. 2023\u2019s excitement around potential developments in the superconductor space seemingly focused attention on the fact that Bruker is one of the few firms with a sizable line of existing superconductor revenues today.\n\nWhile Bruker started off making superconductors for its own lab equipment, it has increasingly found uptake in applications such as renewable energy and electronics. Therefore, all this makes BRKR stock a great pick as shares break out higher following its surge in earnings.\n\nHoneywell (HON) Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the more unique growth opportunities on the Nasdaq is industrial company Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON). And yes, Honeywell is indeed on the Nasdaq. It transferred its listing over the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, highlighting its efforts in the technology and sustainability fields.\n\nStory continues\n\nHoneywell\u2019s roots go back to Butz-Thermo Electric Regulator, a company which developed the first predecessor to the modern thermostat. Over the decades, Honeywell has created all sorts of inventions including barcodes, unleaded gasoline, biodegradable detergents and aviation autopilots.\n\nToday, Honeywell is highly focused on industrial automation. Companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) have prospered due to their smart warehouses and logistics networks. In fact, Honeywell builds much of the underlying infrastructure to support these functions.\n\nAnd, given Honeywell\u2019s history, it should be surprising that the company keeps developing other cutting-edge innovations, such as quantum computing. Honeywell helped generate novel discoveries in quantum computing. It has spun that unit out into a separate firm, Quantinuum, which is pursuing solutions in cybersecurity, drug discovery, supply chain management, AI, and finance among other fields. Honeywell retains a majority shareholding in Quantinuum, and the firm just raised funds at a $5 billion valuation in January.\n\nThis combination of factors makes HON stock a great way to get growth exposure to several promising fields at a reasonable starting valuation.\n\nPepsico (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nAnother surprising company that resides on the Nasdaq exchange is soft drinks and snack food giant Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP).\n\nUnlike most Nasdaq 100 Index companies, Pepsico hasn\u2019t seen its shares appreciate meaningfully over the past year.\n\nThis is understandable. Consumer staples companies such as Pepsico have sold off thanks to higher interest rates. In addition, concerns exist that the GLP-1 category of weight loss drugs could meaningfully lower demand for soft drinks and high-calorie snack foods.\n\nHowever, these concerns seem baked into the price already with PEP stock at a reasonable 21 times forward earnings. Pepsico has delivered steady earnings growth and rising dividend payments for decades on end, and this blue chip Nasdaq stock is a relative bargain in the market today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BRKR stock.

        "content": "As the craze surrounding weight loss drugs like GLP-1s continues, many investors are wondering how to capitalize on the massive valuation given to this sector by many on Wall Street. \r\n\r\nMatt Higgins, RSE Ventures Co-Founder and CEO, joins Yahoo Finance for Good Buy or Goodbye, letting investors know which stocks to dig into and which to avoid when trying manage their portfolios.\n\nHiggins chooses his Good Buy as Eli Lilly (LLY), citing the growth potential of GLP-1 drug market, the pipeline of obesity drugs for Eli Lilly as they continue to perfect weight-loss drugs, and the rate of obesity in America which makes for a large marketability.\n\nHiggins picks his Goodbye as PepsiCo (PEP). Higgins argues GLP-1 users are less likely to snack, which would lead to a drop in snack food sales. Higgins also says that PepsiCo seems slow to pivot to healthier options and that PepsiCo has recently shown a decline in revenue.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino",

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned +0.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.53 per share, indicating a change of +2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.14 points to a change of +6.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +8% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PepsiCo.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $18.22 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.1%. The $94.89 billion and $99.41 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.7% and +4.8%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $27.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.5%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.67 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.24 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.39%. The EPS surprise was +3.49%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The latest earnings reports from Coca Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Pepsi Co (NASDAQ: PEP)\u00a0reflected a\u00a0resilientUS consumer, however with changing habits. As for Coca Cola, its earnings were in line with analyst estimates while sales surpassed analyst expectations.\n\nPepsi Is Facing A\u00a0Slowdown Across Categories\n\nPepsi reported its North America sales slipped about 3.5% during the last quarter of 2023 as consumers were put off by higher prices. In addition to falling North America sales, global revenues were down\u00a00.5%\u00a0YoY to\u00a0$27.85 billion.\u00a0In response, Pepsi lowered its guidance but remained optimistic about 2024 due to optimizing its portfolio by no longer selling unprofitable brands.\n\nCoca Cola\u2019s Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the three months ended on December 31st, Coca Cola reported that revenue grew\u00a07% to $10.85 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of\u00a0$10.68 billion.\u00a0Fourth quarter net income dropped from\u00a0$2.03 billion, or 47 cents per share\u00a0Coca Cola made during 2022\u2019s comparable quarter to\u00a0$1.97 billion, or 46 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of\u00a049 cents per share\u00a0were in line with analyst estimates.\n\nPutting aside pricing and foreign currency,\u00a0unit case volume\u00a0grew\u00a02%\u00a0with the beverage giant estimating that the raging conflict on the Middle East took out 1% of volume growth. Although Pepsi reported a far worse decline in North America, even Coca Cola wasn\u2019t immune to inflation that squeezed the budgets of its consumers. Coca reported a 1% volume drop in North America, while Pepsi experienced a fall of 6% in its beverage business in North America. However, Coca Cola also observed\u00a0strong growth for\u00a0some of its\u00a0higher price point\u00a0and\u00a0premium segments, such as Fairlife and\u00a0Core Power brands.\n\nGuidance Impacted By Foreign Exchange Rates\n\nFor the current, first, quarter, Coca is expecting a\u00a04% headwind from currency exchange rates on comparable revenue, with the headwind also slowing down the growth of\u00a0its earnings per share. It guided for\u00a0an 8% hit from currency changes\u00a0during the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nView more earnings on KO\n\nAs for the full year, Coca Cola guided for\u00a0organic revenue growth\u00a0between\u00a06%\u00a0and\u00a07%\u00a0with a\u00a04% to 5%\u00a0rise in\u00a0comparable earnings per share. Coca Cola warned that foreign exchange rates will impact both its top and bottom lines.\n\nEven the mighty McDonald\u2019s admitted that price hikes are putting off some of its customers as generally consumers are now \u201cmore wary or weary\u201d of pricing. PepsiCo consumers were undoubtedly put off by higher prices. But not Coca Cola\u2019s as with higher prices, the beverage giant managed to overcome a volume decline in North America.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Soft drink bellwether Coca-Cola Company KO reported earnings yesterday and PepsiCo Inc. PEP reported last week.\u00a0 Both giants came up with upbeat earnings, auguring well for the consumer staples sector. Let\u2019s delve a little deeper.\n\nCoca-Cola Beats Overall\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (KO) has reported fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings and sales also improved year over year. The company\u2019s results have benefited from its continued business momentum. KO has outlined its view for 2024.\n\nComparable earnings of 49 cents per share improved 10% from the year-ago period and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. However, unfavorable currency translations hurt comparable earnings by 13 percentage points. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share rose 23% year over year. Revenues of $10,849 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,645 million and improved 7% year over year.\n\nManagement has outlined its view for 2024. It anticipates organic revenue growth of 6-7 for 2024. Comparable revenues are expected to include a 3-4% currency headwind based on current rates. The guidance includes a 4-5% negative impact of acquisition and divestiture. It anticipates an underlying effective tax rate of 19.2% for 2024.\n\nPepsiCo Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Miss\n\nPepsiCo Inc. (PEP) has reported robust fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate and declined year over year.\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter core EPS of $1.78 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 and increased 6.6% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 9% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives.\n\nThe company\u2019s reported EPS of 94 cents rose 152% year over year in the quarter. Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 2% in the quarter. Net revenues of $27,850 million declined 0.5% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28,242 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors may be interested in knowing about the Coke and PepsiCo-heavy ETFs along with their stocks. This is because an ETF approach offers one to bet on both stocks. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo each has exposure to funds like Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTA and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC in the range of 8% to 11%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Nasdaq continues to lead the three major stock indices and is currently near its all-time high. In fact, year-to-date, the Nasdaq is up 5%. That compares with a 4% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index and a 1% increase in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, as well as the Nasdaq is doing, not every stock trading on the index is winning, creating a list of top Nasdaq stocks to sell now.\n\nThe Nasdaq continues to benefit from the fact that it has a large concentration of technology companies listed on its exchange. This has allowed the Nasdaq to benefit from the investor euphoria related to artificial intelligence (AI), as well as other areas of tech such as e-commerce and cybersecurity that are performing exceptionally well.\n\nAgain, with some stocks not performing up to par, here are just a few of the top Nasdaq stocks to sell.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCadence Design Systems (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) provided some truly awful guidance with its just-released earnings print. The company, which makes microchip design software, managed to beat Wall Street forecasts with its fourth quarter 2023 financial results. However, its outlook for the current first quarter of 2024 was extremely weak. The company forecast revenue of $990 million to $1.01 billion, and a profit of $1.10 to $1.14 per share for the current quarter.\n\nThat outlook fell far short of Wall Street consensus estimates of $1.09 billion in revenue and profits of $1.37 a share. Management blamed the weak guidance on tough comparisons in its hardware business, saying they had an exceptionally strong first quarter a year ago due to a hardware backlog. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a major miss for a company that many analysts and investors had expected to be a beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) demand.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrochip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) nearly doubled since its earning report.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, with that kind of meteoric rise, investors should expect a pullback in the near term. Even with better-than-expected earnings, and increased demand for AI, the stock has become a bit overheated.\n\nARM stock has now nearly tripled since the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) last September, and its market capitalization now rivals that of fellow chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Arm\u2019s chips are found in nearly every type of smartphone and many personal computers (PCs), and the company sees a big catalyst in AI. However, anytime a stock runs this hot, a pullback can be expected.\n\nWe also have to factor in that in March, the 180-day post-IPO lock-up period on ARM stock expires, allowing insiders to sell their shares in the company and take profits. This includes Japanese holding company Softbank, which has a 90% stake in Arm Holdings.\n\nCanopy Growth (CGC) Smartphone with logo of Canadian cannabis company Canopy Growth Corporation on screen in front of web page. Cannabis plants are in the background. CGC stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nCannabis producer Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) delivered another monster loss. The company just reported a net loss of $216.8 million as part of its latest financial results. The loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, builds on a net loss of $264.4 million a year earlier. Canopy Growth tried to spin the results, saying that the loss equated to $2.62 per share versus a loss of $5.34 per share a year earlier.\n\nHowever, the per share loss improvement was due to Canopy Growth issuing more stock over the last 12 months, diluting existing shareholders in the process. Revenue for what was the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter continued to steadily decline, totaling $78.5 million, down 8% from $84.9 million a year earlier. Canopy Growth continues to struggle with declining sales and a loss of market share. In recent months, the company sold its corporate headquarters and placed part of its business under creditor protection.\n\nWith CGC stock having lost 99% of its value in the last five years and the shares now trading on the penny stock league tables, there are rumors that a bankruptcy filing is not far off. This makes Canopy Growth one of the top Nasdaq stocks to sell immediately.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) reported a rare revenue miss with its fourth-quarter financial results.\n\nThe company, whose products include Lay\u2019s chips and Mountain Dew, said that demand for its products weakened during Q4 2023, which included the year-end holidays, a time when its sales normally spike. Sales declined 0.5% year-over-year in Q4. Analysts were expecting a 1.4% sales increase in the October to December quarter.\n\nPepsiCo blamed the revenue drop on consumers responding to higher prices at the grocery store, saying that people are seeking out cheaper generic versions of its products. If true, then PepsiCo may have exhausted its pricing power, which is the ability to raise prices without losing customers. There are also concerns about the impact that the new class of weight loss drugs will have on PepsiCo moving forward. All of this is weighing on PEP stock, which is down 6% over the last 12 months. PEP is also one of the top Nasdaq stocks to sell at this time.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefront\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) delivered Q4 2023 financial results and forward guidance that were bad. So bad that it sent PTON stock down 24% in a single day of trading.\n\nWhat spooked investors was management warning of widening losses this year as the maker of internet-connected treadmills and stationary bikes struggles to execute its post-pandemic turnaround strategy. With its share price down 67% over the last 12 months, there are worries about Peloton\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nPeloton guided for a loss in the current first quarter of between $20 million and $30 million. Analysts had expected a loss of $2 million. Peloton had been focusing on trying to grow monthly subscriptions for its online fitness classes. But management now says they\u2019re struggling to grow paid app subscribers and see an uncertain macroeconomic outlook. The company says that it expects to return to revenue growth within a year. That\u2019s little comfort to current shareholders, making PTON another one of the top Nasdaq stocks to sell today.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) In this photo illustration, the Paramount Global (PARA) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nParamount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is another company that has been down on its luck for a longtime. The latest news out of the company is that it\u2019s laying off 800 employees a day after the Super Bowl delivered it the highest ratings in television history. The layoffs come weeks after media entrepreneur Byron Allen offered to buy Paramount Global for $30 billion, including the company\u2019s debt. Excluding debt, Allen has offered $14.3 billion to buy all of the outstanding shares of Paramount Global.\n\nParamount Global let it be known last fall that it was open to a sale after years of grappling with declines in its traditional TV networks and mounting losses from its streaming venture. There\u2019s speculation that Byron Allen would take the entertainment company private if his acquisition is successful. Paramount Global owns the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, CBS television network, specialty TV stations such as BET, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, as well as Paramount+ streaming service.\n\nPARA stock has been in long-term decline. In the last 12 months, the company\u2019s share price has fallen 42%. Over five years, the stock is down 74%, making it a Nasdaq stock to sell in February 2024.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) issued Q4 2023 results that missed Wall Street forecasts across the board as its domestic and international sales each declined. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of 90 cents versus 93 cents that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the final quarter of last year totaled $9.43 billion, which fell short of the $9.59 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. The poor results were blamed on a boycott of Starbucks in the U.S. and increased competition overseas.\n\nGlobal same-store sales at Starbucks increased 5% in Q4 2023, though that figure missed analyst estimates of 7.2%. Starbucks has faced a backlash from conservative consumers in recent months over perceptions that it supports Palestinians in the current war between Israel and Hamas. China, the company\u2019s second-largest market, also disappointed, with the cost of the average item purchased at Starbucks in China falling 9%. Due to the poor results, Starbucks revised down its sales outlook.\n\nSBUX stock has declined 14% in the last 12 months and is near a 52-week low.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The two soda giants are also reporting year-over-year volume declines in North American markets, offset by price hikes alongside inflated food prices.\n\nBeverage Digest Editor and Publisher Duane Stanford explains what the soda and snack manufacturers' performances are indicating about the American consumer, a topic President Biden broached in a recent video addressing snack \"shrinkflation\"\n\n\"When you look at the companies as a whole, they have very different strategies \u2014 PepsiCo, half its business is in snacks and that's a very profitable part of their business,\" Stanford tells Yahoo Finance. \"So, they're looking to always make sure they can maximize investments in the snack business. And so a lot of times, what they're doing is balancing those investments with what they do on the beverage side, so that sometimes leads to decisions when it comes to how much share they're willing to try to take by lowering prices.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.",

        "content": "Dividend stocks can be a beacon of stability for income-oriented investors. These companies distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders through quarterly or annual payouts. This can provide investors with an additional source of passive income during volatile periods.\n\nAdditionally, dividend stocks tend to be more mature, established companies with strong track records. Investors can have peace of mind knowing the company is less likely to go bust. With the AI exuberance in the market continuing to persist, dividend stocks can provide some level of comfort to your portfolio.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discover the 3 most striking dividend stocks to buy now in February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is without a doubt one of the top dividend stocks to buy now. They\u2019re a leading multinational food and beverage company with an extraordinary track record returning cash to shareholders. Furthermore, PepsiCo just announced a 7% increase in their dividend, marking their 52nd annual increase.\n\nPepsiCo covers both manufacturing and distribution of its food and beverage product line. They offer a diverse portfolio of popular brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Lay\u2019s, Gatorade and Quaker. The company was able to close off the 2023 fiscal year on a strong note, despite ongoing supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic instability.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, PepsiCo\u2019s revenue increased 6% YOY to $91.5 billion. While EPS saw a modest 2% growth, Wall Street is more excited about the 2024 outlook. PepsiCo continues to see strength in the Latin America, with operating profit up 67% from the year prior. Management issued 2024 guidance with approximately 4% organic revenue growth and 8% EPS growth. With the company\u2019s annual dividend reaching $5.42 per share, now is a great time to scoop up shares for the long term.\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) In this photo illustration the stock market information of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. displays on a smartphone with the logo of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP stock.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is an enterprise software company that provides HR, payroll and benefits administration services to over 1 million companies across the globe. After closing off a strong 2023 fiscal year, ADP momentum has continued well into 2024.\n\nADP\u2019s superior operational performance and dedicated commitment to shareholders rewards is unmatched. More recently, the company announced their 49th consecutive year of dividend increases bringing their annual yield to $5.60 per share. This places them in the prestigious dividend aristocrat club, averaging over 10% growth in the last 5 years.\n\nIn their latest Q2 FY24 results, ADP revenue increased 6% YOY to $4.6 billion. EPS increased 9% YOY to $2.13 per share, with adjusted EBITDA margin up 20 basis points to 24.6%. Momentum has carried over from the first quarter, driven by record bookings and strong customer retention. If you\u2019re looking for a top dividend stock to buy for 2024, ADP is definitely one of the first places to look.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a titan in the healthcare industry and owns two transformative businesses; UnitedHealthcare and Optum. They continue to see strong diversified growth across both segments, and the company\u2019s 2024 outlook is extremely bullish.\n\nUnitedHealth Group closed off another record year in 2023. Revenue increased 15% YOY to $371.6 billion. However, the metric that stood out the most was operating income up 13.8% YOY to $32.4 billion. Diversified growth has been driving profitability as UNH\u2019s EPS hit a record of $25.12 per share.\n\nOptum has been a key growth driver for the company, and management is forecasting revenues of $400 to $403 billion in FY24. Additionally they project adjusted EPS in the $27.50 to $28.00 per share range. UnitedHealth Group has showcased its resilience in 2023, delivering strong operating results in a tougher macroeconomic environment.

        "content": "Two rival stocks that typically resonate with investors because of their value and steady expansion are Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP). Now is a good time to see if this resonation is holding with both reporting their Q4 results for fiscal 2023 within the last week.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the quarterly reviews for these beverage giants along with their guidance, recent performance, and valuations to see if now is a good time to buy.\n\nCoca-Cola Q4 Review\n\nReporting Q4 results this morning Coca-Cola was able to beat top and bottom-line expectations attributed to higher sales prices despite volume falling -1% in its core North American segment. Fourth quarter earnings of $0.49 a share topped the Zacks Consensus by 2% and rose 9% year over year. On the top line, Q4 sales of $10.84 billion surpassed estimates by 2% as well and were up 7% from the comparative quarter.\n\nCoca-Cola has beaten earnings expectations in each of its last four quarterly reports and has now topped sales estimates for 12 consecutive quarters. Overall, Coca-Cola\u2019s total sales grew 6% in FY23 to $45.8 billion with annual earnings rising 8% to $2.69 per share.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPepsi Q4 Review\n\nPepsi also attested to slower U.S. sales when it reported its Q4 results last Friday and stated its North American beverage volume was down -6%. However, Pepsi was able to beat earnings expectations despite missing top line estimates for the first time since 2018. Quarterly sales of $27.85 billion missed estimates of $28.24 billion by -1% and were slightly down from $27.99 billion a year ago which was Pepsi\u2019s first revenue decline in almost four years.\n\nIn regards to Pepsi\u2019s snack business which separates the company\u2019s offerings from Coca-Cola, its Quaker Foods and Frito-Lay North American segments also saw lower volumes of -8% and -2% respectively. Still, Q4 earnings of $1.78 per share came in 3% better than expected and was up 6% YoY. Despite an end to an unprecedented streak of surpassing sales expectations, Pepsi has now topped earnings estimates for eight consecutive quarters. Furthermore, total sales were up 6% in FY23 to $91.47 billion with annual EPS spiking 12% to $7.62 per share.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFiscal 2024 Guidance\n\nIn their guidance for FY24, Coca-Cola forecasts revenue growth of 6-7% and a 4-5% increase in EPS while Pepsi expects a 4% increase in revenue and EPS growth of at least 8%.\n\nRecent Performance & Valuation\n\nPepsi shares are down -1% in the last year while Coca-Cola\u2019s stock is down -5% with both underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s +22% and their Zacks Beverages-Soft Drinks Market\u2019s +7%. With that being said, over the last three years, Pepsi\u2019s +25% has roughly matched the benchmark although this has trailed its Zack Subindustry\u2019s +33% while Coca-Cola\u2019s +16% has lagged further behind. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotably, Coca-Cola and Pepsi's stock trade at around 21X forward earnings which is on par with the S&P 500 and near their industry average of 19.6X with both being historical leaders in the space. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExceptional Dividend Growth\n\nBeing \u201cdividend kings\u201d and increasing their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years has continued to bolster the value of Coca-Cola and Pepsi stock. Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years with Pepsi at 52 years and counting. At the moment Coca-Cola\u2019s 3.08% annual dividend yield slightly tops Pepsi\u2019s 2.97%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlthough Coca-Cola and Pepsi are dealing with lower volumes attributed to consumers being more conservative on their budgets both stocks land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, longer-term investors may be rewarded from current levels with Coca-Cola and Pepsi still expecting steady growth in FY24 while offering generous and safe dividends to shareholders.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Americans are getting pickier about which pack of soda they pick up.\n\nBoth Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) are seeing a drop in volume sold in North America. For the maker of Coke, volume growth declined 1% last quarter for the region, offset by an 8% increase in prices.\n\nRival PepsiCo saw its North American beverage volume drop 6%, offset by a 9% increase in prices.\n\nExecutives from both companies say they're seeing a resilient, optimistic US consumer \u2014 though buying habits are changing for some.\n\n\"The [North America] consumer has stayed pretty resilient throughout 2023, in the face of fear,\" Coca Cola CFO John Murphy told Yahoo Finance over the phone. \"Pricing in the course of 2023 was much sharper than it has been for a long time.\"\n\nMurphy said some shoppers, particularly low- and middle-income consumers, are feeling the pinch as their weekly spending rises. People are making \"more value- and cost-conscious choices,\" he said, including looking for drinks at different pack sizes and price points.\n\nLast quarter, fewer Americans drank water, sports drinks, coffee, and tea, but orange juice and Coke remained popular.

(Jeff Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)\n\nIn a similar tone, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta told Yahoo Finance last week, \"We're seeing consumer confidence going stronger in the US and we're seeing consumers feeling better.\"\n\nLaguarta said he believes PepsiCo has a \"competitive advantage in smaller size(s).\"\n\nIn a recent earnings call, Laguarta partially attributed the slowdown in the company's revenue growth to North American consumers being pressured on the disposable income front, but he remains optimistic.\n\n\"We feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year. And we hope that by the summer, interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for disposable income in households,\" he said on the call.\n\nBank of America has Buy ratings on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, given they are high-quality, multinational businesses that can generate sustainable returns, analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are looking for \"sales and volume growth\" in the space, and though the two tend to be neck and neck, Coca-Cola sales will likely outpace PepsiCo in 2024, Spillane predicted.\n\nShares of both are down from a year ago, in contrast to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) nearly 20% rise.\n\nThough the cost of dining out keeps rising \u2014 up 5.1% year over year in January per the latest CPI data \u2014 Americans are continuing to return to their pre-pandemic habits.\n\nMurphy noted that Americans are still eating out, heading to movies, traveling, and seeking entertainment, despite sticky inflation. \"People are looking for experiences, they're looking for ways to live life ... we're typically part of that equation,\" he said.\n\nLaguarta said the company is seeing a \"pivot to away from home\" drinking and dining as well.\n\nFor 2024, Coca Cola expects its organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and divestures, to grow 6% to 7%. In contrast, PepsiCo, which has a significant snacks business under its Frito-Lay division, expects a 4% growth in organic revenue.\n\nMurphy, however, is staying on the edge of his seat.\n\n\"Being able to pivot and adapt in the world we're living in to continue to stay close to the consumer is really core to how we think ... it keeps you on your toes.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Coca-Cola Earnings: Is This Rapid-Growth Rival a Better Beverage Bet?",
        "content": "Investors and consumers alike have long asked \u201cCoke or Pepsi?\u201d This is a reasonable question as both stocks and products are very comparable and both have satisfied consumers and investors for decades.\n\nThey both have vast portfolios of products delighting customers daily, steadily growing share prices and earnings, and tidy dividends regularly satisfying shareholders.\n\nBut newcomer Celsius CELH, defining and taking over the \u201cfunctional beverage\u201d market may actually be the stock investors should be considering. Celsius stock has been untouchable in terms of performance, compounding at a ridiculous 121% annually over the last five years.\n\nSo should investors pick one of these stocks, or may they complement each other in a well-diversified portfolio?\n\nSoft drink giant Coca-Cola KO reports earnings Tuesday after the market closes, while PepsiCo PEP doesn\u2019t report again until late April and Celsius in March. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCoca-Cola: A Legacy of Refreshment\n\nCoca-Cola stands as a titan of the beverage industry, boasting a brand recognition that transcends borders. Its core portfolio, anchored by the classic Coke and Sprite, enjoys enduring popularity. Management has also steadily been adding products, venturing into the healthy and functional category with Coke Zero Sugar, Smart Water and Topo Chico.\n\nCoca-Cola stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revisions trend. Sales for the current quarter are forecast to grow 5.1% YoY and for FY23 5.8% YoY. Earnings over the same periods are projected to increase 6.7% YoY and 8%YoY.\n\nThese growth rates are consistent with the long-term, steady increases management and shareholders love to see. KO also pays a dividend yield of 3.1% and has raised the payment by an average of 3.4% annually over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPepsiCo: The Rival\n\nPepsiCo has long been the archrival to Coca-Cola and presents a formidable challenge. Pepsi too has a very strong brand and is further bolstered by its snacks brands at Frito-Lay and sports drink Gatorade.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike KO, PEP\u2019s earnings revision trend has been flat over the past two months, giving it a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Growth rates for Pepsi are nearly the same as Coca-Cola, but slightly lower.\n\nThe two companies also have very similar valuations, with KO trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 21.3x and PEP 21x. They are also both below their respective historical median valuations, with KO\u2019s 10-year median at 23.1x and PEP\u2019s at 22.3x.\n\nPepsiCo too pays a handsome dividend yield of 3% and has raised the payout by an average of 6.7% annually over the last five years. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe two soft drink behemoths have had very similar returns since the start of 2023 as well, losing ~6% over the last 14 months. In the chart below we can see that in October of 2023, both stocks experienced some heavy selling, pushing them down double digits YTD, while the market leaders were up considerably on the year.\n\nIt is not often you get the opportunity to pick up companies as high-quality as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and those investors who stepped up during the selloff have done decently well. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nCelsius: The Maverick Newcomer\n\nCelsius, a relative newcomer, has carved a niche in the functional beverage market with its fitness-focused drinks. Its bold flavors and focus on energy, metabolism, and endurance have attracted a loyal following.\n\nCelsius too has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting a mixed earnings revision trend. But the epic returns from its stock are driven by the almost unbelievable sales growth the company has seen. In 2019, annual sales at CELH were $75 million. In the trailing 12 months they are $1.15 billion. You would be hard pressed to find a single other company that grew at such a rate.\n\nSales and earnings forecasts are very strong as well, which can be seen in the table below. Current year sales are expected to climb nearly 100% YoY to $1.3 billion and EPS are projected to jump 185%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe long-term price action chart on CELH looks quite promising as well. The stock price has traded sideways for nearly six months now, building a very large and convincing bull flag. If the stock can break out above the $60 level, we could see the stock explode to new highs again. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo be honest, at current levels I think all of these stocks are quite appealing. Even with the mixed earnings revision trends, they are each trading below their historical median valuations, and provide investors with complementary portfolio returns.\n\nIf those earnings revisions trends began to trend higher, and the Zacks Ranks improves, any one of these stocks would be a screaming buy. Otherwise, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo offer nice dividend yields at a reasonable valuation, while Celsius offers the potential for exceptional returns, though with higher volatility.\n\nThe earnings meeting this afternoon from Coca-Cola should provide some very interesting insight into the industry and sector more broadly.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Inflation: Cost of eating out continues to rise, a potential hit to restaurant chains",
        "content": "More Americans will be thinking twice before they say yes to a fancy dinner out on the town.\n\nThe cost of dining out in January was up 5.1% year over year, and up 0.5% compared to the previous month. On the other hand, the cost of groceries has moderated, with a 1.2% increase compared to last year, and up 0.7% compared to December.\n\n\"Historically, when commodity inflation runs ahead of labor inflation, grocery pricing pushes ahead of restaurants,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in client note. \"When labor inflation runs ahead of commodity inflation, restaurant prices tend to outpace grocery pricing.\"\n\nLabor is a key pressure point this year, as 22 states raised their minimum wages on Jan.1, while Oregon, Nevada, and Florida are set to increase theirs later this year.\n\nAnd California is facing a looming wage jump as a result of the FAST Act. Beginning in April, food chains that have at least 60 locations nationwide will be required to raise their minimum wage for restaurant employees to $20 per hour.\n\nAs the bill rises, some customers will likely pull back on restaurant visits in favor of cooking at home. \"You're going to see greater pivot at that lower income level,\" Tower told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\n\nThis is already putting pressure on brands like McDonald's (MCD). In its Q3 earnings call last week, CEO Chris Kempczinski called it a \"battleground\" to get the attention of the low-income consumer.\n\n\"There's some transaction size reduction\" and \"some trade down\" among the demographic, he said.\n\nOthers with higher exposure to low-income consumers include Wendy's (WEN), Domino's (DPZ), and Taco Bell (YUM), per Citi's analysis.\n\nChili's parent company Brinker International (EAT) has also been trying to adjust to changing consumer sentiments. \"We're seeing improved responsiveness to TV ads that showcase really sharp value,\" CEO Kevin Hochman said in a call with investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut customers who come in for deals aren't \"buying as much alcohol or desserts,\" he said. The company is planning to use promotions like $6 margaritas to boost traffic.\n\nMore discounts could be coming. If foot traffic broadly \"does not improve from this point forward,\" companies will have to offer better deals, said Tower, or lean into categories that may be not as inflationary, like fries or chicken over beef.\n\nWhile Starbucks tends to skew a higher-income demographic, some of its customer base is changing their spending habits as well. The coffee chain's US foot traffic was up a mere 1% in its latest quarter, while the check size went up 4%.\n\nBoth numbers were under analysts' estimates, partially because the \"occasional\" customer visited less.\n\nStarbucks drinkers are \"managing their checks, managing their frequency, or doing a combination of both,\" said Tower. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 30: People exit a Starbucks store in Manhattan on January 30, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Spencer Platt via Getty Images)\n\nBut consumer staples companies that supplies both groceries stores and restaurants and bars could be well positioned in 2024.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) CEO Ramon Luis Laguarta said on an investor call that the company is \"putting a lot of focus\" in the food away from home channel, as people continue to go back to normal socializing patterns. The company is expecting to gain market share within the restaurants industry, per Laguarta.\n\nHow much people continue to go out will be the issue to watch for food companies that have large \"away from home\" businesses, Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nBut moderating inflation likely won't result in lower prices in grocery aisles, said Spillane. Rather, consumer staples companies will hold the higher prices and reinvest the profit behind their brands.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Next Coca-Cola? 3 Beverage Stocks That Investors Shouldn\u2019t Ignore.",
        "content": "Two of the most successful companies in U.S. history are centered around beverage products. Of course, I\u2019m talking about Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). The two firms\u2019 sodas have become well-known and popular in much of the world, with KO, in particular, becoming quite ubiquitous globally. As a result of these trends, the market capitalizations of Coca-Cola and Pepsi are a huge $257 billion and $240 billion, respectively. But other U.S. beverage firms have also been successful. For example, the market capitalizations of Keurig Dr. Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) are now $44 billion and $59 billion, respectively.\n\nWhile we may not see another Coca-Cola or PepsiCo in our lifetimes, the beverage sector is very lucrative for some companies. Here are three beverage stocks that can grow explosively over the long term. And who knows? Maybe one of these firms could catch fire and become the next Coke or Pepsi.\n\nMonster Beverage (MNST) Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.\n\nSource: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com\n\nMonster is a leader in the U.S. energy-drink category and that category is rapidly growing. According to Statista, the revenue generated by energy drinks in America jumped 13.7% in 2022 and 12.9% in 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s not surprising that Monster\u2019s top and bottom lines are also rapidly increasing. In Q3 of last year, for example, its revenue jumped 16% versus the same period a year earlier, while its net income surged 40% year-over-year (YoY) to $453 million.\n\nAlso encouraging is that the revenue generated by Monster\u2019s emerging alcoholic beverages jumped 58% YoY to $42.3 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Street is quite upbeat on MNST. In December, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) identified MNST as one of 37 high-growth stocks with low volume. In January, it identified the name as a high-quality growth stock.\n\nAnd last month, Goldman (NYSE:GS) identified MNST as one of the top beneficiaries of strong return-on-equity growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe popularity of Celsius\u2019 (NASDAQ:CELH) healthy carbonated energy drink offerings is growing rapidly, and the firm is taking market share in the popular category. Indeed, as I noted in a previous column, CELH\u2019s \u201crevenue soared 105% in the four-week period that ended on December 30,\u201d according to research firm Nielsen.\n\nThe firm has already expanded to Canada and intends to start selling its beverages in a wide variety of countries over the longer term. Of course, Celsius\u2019 overseas expansion should cause its growth to accelerate to even more impressive levels.\n\nCelsius\u2019 sales doubled in the first three quarters of 2024, and the fact that it\u2019s offering healthy, fairly good-tasting (in my view) products in the rapidly growing energy-drink category leaves it well-positioned to be extremely successful down the road.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gave CELH a fairly high Composite Rating of 83 out of 99.\n\nZevia PBC (ZVIA) Food Trends\n\nSource: \u00a9iStock.com/rsi1986\n\nZeviaPBC (NYSE:ZVIA) markets its namesake sodas that, as far as I can tell, are the only carbonated beverages available on a wide scale sweetened solely by stevia.\n\nUnlike sugar, stevia has no calories or known, major, negative impact on people\u2019s health. Moreover, the chemicals used to make diet sodas, such as aspartame, have also been identified as potentially having very negative effects on humans. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that aspartame may cause cancer, and some indications show it could undermine memory.\n\nAs someone who drinks both Zevia\u2019s products and diet soda rather frequently, I can attest that, in my view, Zevia\u2019s sodas taste around 20% to 30% better than diet sodas.\n\nZevia\u2019s top line dropped 2.6% in Q3 versus the same period a year earlier, while it generated a per-share loss of 16 cents.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s gross margin of 45% is quite high, indicating it could increase its sales and market share a great deal by lowering its prices. What\u2019s more, the firm reported in November that it had supply chain issues and was taking multiple steps to rectify them.\n\nFinally, ZVIA reported \u201cthe world\u2019s largest retailer,\u201d presumably WalMart (NYSE:WMT), had been trialing \u201cthe brand\u2019s performance in the mainstream carbonated soft aisle.\u201d Sales of Zevia\u2019s products at WMT jumped by triple-digit percentage levels and were \u201coutperforming expectations,\u201d Zevia added.\n\nThe superior healthiness of Zevia\u2019s beverages and its success at WalMart bodes very well for the long-term outlook of ZVIA stock.\n\nGiven these points, I think it has the highest ceiling among beverage stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Post-Earnings Purge: 3 Stocks to Sell After Disastrous Reports",
        "content": "We\u2019re now two-thirds through fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season. With the majority of companies in the S&P 500 report latest results, 75% posted better-than-expected profits and 65% surprised to the upside with their sales. Overall, earnings are up 2.9% from a year earlier, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth among U.S. companies. Further, Q4 of last year was a strong one for Corporate America.\n\nHowever, exceptions stand out. While most companies beat Wall Street forecasts with their latest prints, some companies disappointed. As a result, share prices sharply lowered. For many of these, their latest financial results have exposed deeper problems that are unlikely to be resolved in the near-term.\n\nLet\u2019s examine three stocks to sell after their latest, less-than-stellar reports.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nYou know it\u2019s a bad print when your stock falls 30% in one day. Sadly, that\u2019s exactly what happened to social media company Snap (NYSE:SNAP) after announcing disappointing revenue figures for the final quarter of 2023. Also, it offered up weak forward guidance.\n\nSNAP stock is now down 36% since its Q4 earnings were made public. The company\u2019s share price is down 87% from an all-time high reached in September 2021.\n\nThe company behind Snapchat announced Q4 2023 earnings per share (EPS) of 8 cents, which beat forecasts of 6 cents. However, revenue of $1.36 billion missed expectations pf $1.38 billion. And, average revenue per user on Snapchat came in light at $3.29 compared to the estimated $3.33. However, the most damaging news from Snap was that it expects a loss of $55 million to $95 million in the current first quarter. This is much worse than the $21.9 million analysts had anticipated.\n\nFinally, Snap announced that it will cut 10% of its global workforce, or about 500 employees. But that news hasn\u2019t help SNAP stock any after a disastrous earnings report.\n\nStory continues\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is another social media company whose stock got hammered after a poor Q4 earnings print. PINS fell 10% on news of a revenue miss and soft forward guidance.\n\nThe stock initially fell 28% but pared some of that decline after a new partnership with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:Google) was announced. Pinterest is now down 57% since peaking in February 2021.\n\nAlso, the company announced EPS of 53 cents versus the forecasted 51 cents. Unfortunately, the company\u2019s revenue missed the mark at $981 million versus $991 million of the analysts\u2019 consensus forecast. Looking ahead, Pinterest expects revenue of $690 million to $705 million for the current quarter, which represents annualized growth of 15% to 17%, less than analysts had wanted. Fortunately, Pinterest announced a new deal for third-party ads on Google. Otherwise, things would have been worse.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.\n\nSource: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnack food and soft drink giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) reported a rare sales miss with its latest earnings. The company, whose products include Lay\u2019s potato chips and Mountain Dew pop, said that demand weakened during Q4 2023.\n\nPepsiCo was quick to point out that the revenue miss wasn\u2019t due to the new crop of weight loss drugs. Specifically, they indicated that the issue was consumers seeking out cheaper generic versions of its products amid ongoing price hikes. It was the first revenue decline in nearly four years.\n\nWhatever the cause, PEP announced EPS of $1.78 compared to $1.72 that was forecast on Wall Street. Revenue came in at $27.85 billion versus $28.40 billion that was expected among analysts. Sales declined 0.5% year over year (YOY), while analysts were expecting a 1.4% sales increase. PEP stock fell 4% immediately after its earnings were made public. Even before the Q4 print, PepsiCo\u2019s share price was weak, having declined 6% through 12 months and trailing the market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole\u00a0held a long position in GOOGL.

        "title": "Super Bowl LVIII: Big beer battles for sales, and investors",
        "content": "Super Bowl LVIII is big beer\u2019s prime-time opportunity to finally throw a touchdown to investors.\n\nUp until this Sunday's marquee matchup in Las Vegas, the beer industry has largely been on defense the past two years.\n\nU.S. beer shipments fell to a 25-year low in 2023, according to new data out of BofA Securities, as politically and culturally-driven boycotts and consumer tastes shifting to hard seltzers and liquor have pressured industry sales.\n\nIn the past two years alone, beer shipments have tanked 9% to 196 million barrels.\n\nInvestors have reacted in a sober manner.\n\nShares of pure-play beer brands Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and Corona-maker Constellation Brands (STZ) have gained a mere 3% each over the two-year stretch, lagging the S&P 500's 14% gain.\n\nMolsonCoors (TAP) shares have bucked the trend, rising 20% amid a push into non-beer brands such as The Rock's Zoa energy drink line.\n\n\"The stakes are high [this year],\" Bank of America analyst Peter Galbo told Yahoo Finance Live, as brewers look to \"gain new entrants into the category.\"\n\nGalbo says that execution this Super Bowl Sunday is \"critical,\" especially for the still struggling Bud Light brand, writing that the \"Super Bowl could be a venue to re-establish identity.\"\n\nRecall Bud Light is still reeling from backlash last year tied to an endorsement on Instagram from transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nBud Light volume for the month of January plunged 29.5% year-over-year, while Budweiser volumes declined more than 15%, according to the latest data from Nielsen.\n\nIn an effort to lure back lost customers, Bud Light is aiming to return to its roots and reset the brand's image in its 60 second ads on Super Bowl Sunday. Channeling a pint of nostalgia, the beer giant will call its iconic Clydesdale horses out of the retirement barn in an ad dubbed \"Old School Delivery.\"\n\nIt will mark one of three Super Bowl ads for Anheuser-Busch, with the other two showcasing good old- fashioned Budweiser and low calorie Michelob Ultra.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We haven\u2019t seen Bud Light turn the corner yet this year, but their Super Bowl ads are phenomenal, funny and are of the same humor that built Bud Light into America\u2019s largest selling brand,\" Bump Williams, of long-time beverage consulting firm BWC, told Yahoo Finance by phone. \"I think you'll see a positive impact on consumer appreciation of the brand.\"\n\nFurther helping Bud Light ahead of the Super Bowl: A former president with a big following of influential beer drinkers.\n\nEarlier this week, former President Donald Trump came to Bud Light's defense, encouraging his supporters in a post on Truth Social to give the brand a \"second chance.\" (Of course, the former president is himself a teetotaler, but his followers tend to have some pretty strong brand loyalty for whatever he recommends).\n\n\"Anheuser-Busch is clearly making a strong and concerted effort to win back Bud Light drinkers,\" EvercoreISI analyst Robert Ottenstein told Yahoo Finance. \"It\u2019s too early to know how successful that will be.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some of Anheuser-Busch's rivals will look to keep the pressure on this Super Bowl.\n\nMolsonCoors plans to run an ad featuring rap legend LL Cool J speeding through the mountains in the Coors Light Chill Train. In one portion of the spot, the train rips through a beach and appears to knock over a pail holding two Corona beers.\n\nIt's easy to explain why marketing execs at Coors are feeling feisty.\n\nSales of Coors Light and Miller Lite were up 11.8% and 6.7%, respectively, for the week-ended January 13 Nielsen data shows.\n\nConstellation Brands will be silent on TV this Super Bowl, perhaps feeling as if they didn't need to spend $7 million for a 30 second spot.\n\nThe company's Modelo brand dethroned Bud Light as America\u2019s top-selling beer for the first time last May, and has held the title ever since.\n\n\"This is a true heavyweight knockdown, drag-out fight,\" Galbo said of the battle brewing among beer makers.\n\nNot unlike what the 49ers and Chiefs are about to endure on Sunday.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Super Bowl LVIII: The top food and drink stocks in focus, from PepsiCo to Chipotle",
        "content": "This Super Bowl weekend, investor eyes may not just be on football \u2014 they will be looking at food and drink stocks for opportunities for their portfolio.\n\nIn notes to clients and in conversations with Yahoo Finance, analysts shared their thoughts on companies whose drinks and snacks will be at parties throughout the US this Sunday.\n\nStarting with soda, which market research firm Numerator said is the most popular beverage for Super Bowl celebrations, it'll be a battle between PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), and Keurig Dr. Pepper (KDP).\n\nBut the two famous brands will be the best picks, said Morningstar analyst Dan Su, who projects that Coke and PepsiCo have long-term competitive advantages over their rivals in the next 20 years.\n\nBank of America also has Buy ratings on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, given they are high-quality, multinational businesses that can generate sustainable returns, analyst Bryan Spillane told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInvestors are looking for \"sales and volume growth\" in the space, and though the two tend to be neck and neck, Coca-Cola sales will likely outpace PepsiCo in 2024, Spillane predicted.\n\nWhile half of Super Bowl watchers will buy soda before the event, according to Numerator, another 37% will get beer, and 22% will stock up on spirits.\n\nThe beer industry had an up and down 2023, and the big three producers, AB InBev (BUD), Molson Coors (TAP), and Constellation Brands (STZ), will be looking to play offense.\n\n\"It's this whole dynamic about the three of them colliding at the Super Bowl,\" Spillane said. Molson Coors is looking to hold onto the gains it made during the Bud Light boycotts. On the other hand, Bud maker AB InBev has been running an ad campaign with NFL Hall of Famers Peyton Manning and Emmitt Smith as it looks for a comeback.\n\nBut Constellation Brands may have already won the battle, as Mexican import beers keep gaining in popularity, per Spillane.\n\nThe beverage giant, and others with Mexican import brands, could make further headway this year, said Bump Williams of Bump Williams Consulting.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We've already seen retailers in the back half of '23 give more shelf space to these brands in this segment,\" Williams told Yahoo Finance. \"We're going to continue to see that probably expand more as the spring sets get launched in March, April [2024].\"\n\nFor those looking at another area of the liquor shelf, tequila has been having a moment.\n\nIn a note to clients, Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein noted volumes for the liquor are seeing \"notable\" strength, up 7.2% year over year. Diageo (DEO), which owns Casamigos and Don Julio, led the pack with a 15.7% volume growth.\n\nWhat's a game without chip and dip? The big brands will likely benefit, as people are \"probably not going to buy private label\" for the big occasion, Mizuho Securities managing director John Baumgartner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFor Baumgartner, his top picks include Kraft Heinz (KHC), based on its \"indulgent snacks,\" as well as Mondel\u0113z International (MDLZ), for its cookie and cracker offerings.\n\nKraft Heinz is also a pick for Bank of America analyst Peter Galbo. One big reason: Velveeta. (Ever try Velveeta with Rotel? This reporter hasn't but plans to this Super Bowl).\n\nFor fans of wings, check out Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), said Galbo.\n\n\"They're the second largest chicken company in the US. ... They produce a lot of wings, as does Tyson, but historically, Pilgrim's Pride has been a better operator and better fundamentals,\" he said.\n\nWhile the Super Bowl won't give retailers a meaningful bump, Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) are good bets as consumers search for value in 2024.\n\n\"Walmart and Costco are two that are well positioned to benefit over the next 12 to 18 months,\" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe told Yahoo Finance. Branding and snacks are spotted at Taste of the NFL during Super Bowl weekend at Chateau Luxe on February 11, 2023, in Phoenix, Arizona. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for GENYOUth) (Tasos Katopodis via Getty Images)\n\nOrdering in? Morningstar Sean Dunlop suggested YUM! Brands (YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, is the best among pizza and wings chains.\n\n\"Chipotle also does surprisingly good Super Bowl business, historically,\" said Dunlop, as Chipotle's takeout and delivery business lends itself to group parties.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Decoding PepsiCo Inc (PEP): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Strengths highlight PepsiCo's robust brand portfolio and innovation capabilities. Weaknesses underscore the challenges of supply chain volatility and input cost fluctuations. Opportunities emphasize the potential in sustainable practices and digital transformation. Threats reveal the impact of geopolitical tensions and competitive pressures.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) filed its annual 10-K report, offering a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. As a global leader in snacks and beverages, PepsiCo's portfolio includes powerhouse brands like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, and Doritos. The company's financial tables from the filing reflect a solid balance sheet, with a market capitalization of $255.9 billion as of June 16, 2023. With operations spanning over 200 countries and territories, PepsiCo's diversified product mix and international presence have enabled it to maintain a strong competitive stance in the industry. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the 10-K filing, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of PepsiCo's strategic outlook.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with PEP. Decoding PepsiCo Inc (PEP): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nBrand Portfolio and Market Presence: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) boasts an impressive array of brands that command significant consumer loyalty and market share. The company's strength lies in its ability to maintain leadership positions in the convenient food industry both in the U.S. and globally. With a 19% share of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category and a robust presence in the savory snacks market, PepsiCo's brand equity is a formidable asset. The company's strategic marketing and promotional activities, coupled with its extensive distribution network, underpin its competitive advantage.\n\nInnovation and Research Development: PepsiCo's commitment to innovation is evident in its research and development initiatives. The company invests in creating consumer-preferred products and improving manufacturing processes, which are crucial for growth and transformation. Its focus on reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat, and developing sustainable packaging solutions, positions PepsiCo at the forefront of industry trends. The global research centers are instrumental in driving product innovation, ensuring that the company stays ahead of consumer demands and environmental considerations.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSupply Chain and Input Cost Volatility: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) acknowledges the challenges posed by increased commodity, packaging, and other input costs, as well as supply constraints. The company's reliance on the open market for essential ingredients and raw materials exposes it to price fluctuations, which can impact profitability. Although PepsiCo employs risk management strategies such as fixed-price contracts and derivatives, the inability to fully pass on cost increases to customers remains a weakness that can affect margins.\n\nGeopolitical and Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the resultant geopolitical tensions have led to supply chain disruptions and increased input costs for PepsiCo. The company's operations in affected regions face heightened risks, including potential asset nationalization or expropriation. These uncertainties can lead to business disruptions and impact the company's ability to achieve sustainability goals, posing a significant challenge to its operational stability.\n\nOpportunities\n\nSustainability Initiatives: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) has the opportunity to enhance its brand image and consumer appeal through its sustainability efforts. The company's investments in sustainable farming practices and the integration of recyclable materials in packaging resonate with the growing consumer demand for environmentally responsible products. By advancing these initiatives, PepsiCo can strengthen its market position and potentially gain a competitive edge over less sustainable rivals.\n\nDigital Transformation and E-commerce: The shift towards digital channels presents a significant opportunity for PepsiCo. The company's efforts to strengthen its omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce, can lead to increased sales and customer engagement. Leveraging artificial intelligence and data analytics for consumer insights and research can drive innovation and operational efficiency, enabling PepsiCo to capitalize on the evolving retail landscape.\n\nThreats\n\nIntense Competition: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) operates in a highly competitive industry, with rivals like The Coca-Cola Company holding a significant carbonated soft drink share advantage in many markets outside the U.S. The company must continuously innovate and effectively promote its products to maintain and grow its market share. Failure to do so could result in reduced sales and necessitate increased capital and marketing expenditures.\n\nWater Scarcity and Environmental Concerns: As a beverage and convenient food manufacturer, PepsiCo relies heavily on water. Water scarcity and the need for conservation pose a threat to the company's supply chain and operational efficiency. Regulatory changes and increased public scrutiny regarding water use can lead to higher compliance costs and capital expenditures, potentially impacting PepsiCo's financial performance and reputation.\n\nIn conclusion, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) exhibits a strong market presence and brand portfolio, backed by strategic innovation and a global footprint. However, the company must navigate supply chain volatility, geopolitical risks, and intense competition. Opportunities in sustainability and digital transformation offer pathways for growth, while threats from environmental concerns and competitive pressures require vigilant management. Overall, PepsiCo's strategic initiatives and risk mitigation efforts position it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic global market.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Our reported fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results in North America reflect the impacts associated with 1 less reporting week versus when compared to the prior year. \r\nJoining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and CFO, Jamie Caulfield. \r\n(Operator Instructions) With that, operator, I'll turn it over for the first question.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\n\nBryan Douglass Spillane\n\nJamie, I'm not sure who's more surprised. We're seeing each other again, me or you but welcome back.\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nIt's great to talk to you again, Bryan.\n\nBryan Douglass Spillane\n\nSo I have a question, I guess, just -- if you can field a few questions today about the organic sales growth guidance for the year. And maybe if you can help dimensionalize, not just the reduction but how much is recall, things that are sort of external? How much are things that are under your control? And maybe you can think about as we think the balance of that, just how much of improvement are you expecting maybe in North America versus international? Just trying to understand the moving parts of how we get to the organic sales guide for the year.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nBryan, this is Ramon. Listen, let me step back for a minute and talk about the last 3 years and then how next year fits into that. So the last few years, we've seen a double-digit growth top line in the business consistently. So I think it's an 11% CAGR and a 14% or double-digit EPS growth consistently as well. So 3 very good years now. We see a -- in '24, we see a normalization of the categories and normalization of the cost, normalization of inflation. So we see everything trending back to our long-term algorithm. \r\nNow we guided to upper end of the -- both top line and bottom line at the previous earnings call. We maintained the top line at the upper end for the EPS and we moved back to at least 4% for the top line. And there's a few factors that I think are material. One is the Quaker recall. We had a food safety incident in our Quaker supply chain in the U.S. which has impacted us in November, December and it will continue to impact us, I think, for the -- at least for the first half of the year until we recover our supply chain to normality. \r\nWe're also seeing some geopolitical events around the world that are impacting some of our markets, which might potentially continue in the first half of next year. And then the third element is, we're seeing a bit of a slowdown in the U.S., both the food category and the beverage category in the Q4. Part of that is slowdown due to pricing and disposable income situation. Part of that is also pivoting between in home consumption and away from home consumption that we're seeing in our business in the U.S. We think that, that might continue in next year. So that's why we're lowering our guidance. We feel good about the consumer in '24 in the U.S. We feel good in the sense of very low unemployment. \r\nWe feel good about the fact that we think wages will go higher than inflation next year. And we hope that by the summer, interest rates will go down and that will create another source of oxygen for disposable income in households. So we feel good about the consumer in the U.S. but if you think about those 3 elements where -- why we decided to have at least 4% as the guidance for the top line.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\n\nLauren Rae Lieberman\n\nGreat. Just kind of continuing on that thread perhaps, Ramon, we're focusing more on Frito. So track channel data hasn't looked great. The reported volume decline sort of bigger than what we've seen in some time for this business. But when I look at a multiyear stack, things look kind of steadier sequentially, when I look at the second half. So just curious how much of maybe these near-term results on Frito and looking into the beginning of the year is more multiyear comps. Is it the consumer backdrop, the impact of pricing? But just thinking a little bit about your expectations for -- plans, I guess, for driving greater units -- unit versus volume growth in '24, thinking about those 2 pieces.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nGreat. Lauren, I think it's a great question. Yes, to summarize, we're seeing the Frito business going back to profitable volume growth in '24. So that's how we're thinking about the business. If you think about the slowdown in Q4 and you link it to the elements that I was referring to, there is a units versus volume dynamic in the Frito business that is quite relevant. As you see consumption moving from in home to away from home, the portion size is meaningfully different. So we're seeing growth in convenience stores. We're seeing growth in away from home in, like 2 to 3x the retail growth but obviously has an implication on volume. \r\nAs we look at the '24, we have a very strong commercial plan for Frito. We have -- our core brands very well invested. You saw that in '23, we increased our A&M meaningfully, we're planning to do that as well in '24. So Lays has a big increase in A&M, Doritos has a big increase in A&M, all our permissible portfolio, which, if you think about a combination of SunChips, PopCorners, the whole Simply line, Smartfood, that part of the portfolio is growing almost 3x the average of Frito. \r\nSo we're putting a lot of emphasis on that particular part of the portfolio and make sure that it has -- is well executed in the store. And now that supply chain is back to 100%, we're going to push that part of the portfolio even more aggressively. So we think that Frito will have a continuation of the share of market gains that it's been having for the last couple of years and we expect the category will rebound as well, part of that because of what we'll do with our brands, which obviously have a lot of weight in the overall category. But also the fact that we think consumers will continue to feel better throughout the year and that will recover the Frito-Lay top line, with a more balanced profitable volume growth and pricing versus what we've seen this year.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\n\nBonnie Lee Herzog\n\nAll right. I guess I had a question on PBNA profitability. I believe you still have a goal to reach the mid-teen operating margin levels. But so far, we really haven't seen much progress. So Ramon, I guess hoping you could touch on your plans to achieve this. And then maybe whether you're considering making bigger structural changes to your business? If there's possible refranchising of your bottling network. I know you've mentioned in the past that you do see some advantages with broadly owning your network. But just curious to hear if your thoughts on this have changed. And I guess if not, what other initiatives do you plan to implement to improve profitability at PBNA?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nYes. So yes, listen, I would say we don't contemplate at this point any of the structural changes to our business. We continue to think that operating the business has advantages for us in terms of speed of execution and some other elements that -- as we see where the business is growing, in e-commerce, away from home and some other channels of the future, including direct-to-consumer, we think that that's going to create an advantage for us. Now we've been making progress at a good pace in our margin improvement. If you think about the last 3 years, the net revenue for PBNA has grown over $5 billion and the operating profit has grown $1 billion. Core operating margin has expanded more than 150 bps. So we see in the last few years a good improvement in the PBNA business. \r\nWe think this will continue in the coming years, actually '24, that's the first step. We are optimizing the portfolio. We're eliminating parts of the portfolio that were less profitable. We've referred to bottled water. We've referred to some multi-serve parts of the portfolio that were not that profitable. We continue to optimize our efficiency of our supply chain, we're digitalizing our supply chain. We continue to extract -- eliminate waste from that. We continue to work on global business services that reduces the G&A. \r\nWe're also optimizing A&M, trying to get to higher ROI on A&M and our trade investments. So we continue to think that optimizing all those elements in the different parts of the P&L will continue to drive a sustainable margin improvement, whilst we remain very competitive in the marketplace. And that's the balance that we're trying to strike with this business. So far, we feel good. The business grew with the rest of the category. If you take everything that is in our system, grew in line with the category and we increased the operating margin. So that's how we're thinking at this point about the PBNA business and with a long-term perspective, obviously, in how we will achieve those 2 elements of growing with the category and increasing the margins.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Jefferies.\n\nKaumil S. Gajrawala\n\nWelcome back, Jamie. Well, I suppose you've gone nowhere but welcome back to dealing with us, I guess. Can you maybe talk a bit more about international, particularly margins are picking up above the average now, it's scaling quite nicely. But also if there's anything we need to be aware of as it relates to hyperinflation, Argentina, anything like that?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nNo, listen, I'll start and maybe Jamie can add to this. The -- listen, the international opportunity continues to be probably the most remarkable and exciting opportunity that we have as a company. As you're saying, our international business is very scaled now. It's almost $40 billion between beverages and snacks. So that's, if you compare it to some of the consumer goods companies, it's much bigger than many of the consumer goods companies globally. So clearly, a big opportunity and we have just scratched the surface when you think about the per capita consumption that we have in many markets and the opportunity we have ahead of us. \r\nSo yes, you pointed it right. As we scale it, some of those businesses are becoming more profitable. And obviously, you start the virtuous circle of scale, reinvestment, margin expansion and getting to a much more profitable and advantaged businesses across many markets. So this year is not going to be a different one. So '24, we continue to think that international will grow faster than the U.S. business. We're seeing good momentum as we start the year in many of our international businesses. \r\nOur position is of investment in those markets. So we're going aggressively with productivity and reinvestment for growth, reinvestment in the brands, reinvestments in systems, in capabilities that continue to drive the per caps and our share of market position. So you should think about our international business as a big opportunity for PepsiCo. And with regards to the Argentina situation, it's -- we've already taken that hyper accounting and you shouldn't expect any material impact on organic sales growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\n\nDara Warren Mohsenian\n\nJamie, great to hear your voice again. So I wanted to drill down a bit more on Bonnie's question but looking at PBNA, top line more than profit, there's clearly been some market share struggles in pieces of the portfolio there, sports drinks, CSDs, et cetera. So I guess can you just talk a little bit more about strategy changes from a top line standpoint how you sort of manage the business by product category and your thoughts around share trends as we look going forward?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nGood. Listen, we feel good about the overall portfolio of PBNA. We manage the business as a full LRB business, not as a CSD or any particular subcategory. We're looking at the full portfolio and how it's always everywhere for consumers from the morning to the night, in all the multiple occasions. We continue to believe that we have an advantaged portfolio, if you think about our positions in sports and hydration, our positions in coffee, tea, now the portfolio we have in energy and our CSD position as well. So we continue to manage as a full LRB. Now if you think about our priorities for the year, relaunch of Pepsi brand, with a new image, with focus on Zero. Zero has been growing very fast and continues to be an advantage proposition for us. We're putting a lot of additional investment in Mountain Dew and we're launching Baja Blast as a permanent SKU. Baja Blast had been a success as an LTO or limited time offer for many years. \r\nNow we're launching it. We're using the Super Bowl as a platform this weekend to launch Baja Blast. We continue to build a position in lemon-lime with Starry. Starry, it's been a good first year. I think we had -- we're over indexing with Gen Z. We see the brand getting some good repeat. You will see also an investment around Super Bowl and continue during the year. So that's our CSD portfolio. \r\nWe feel very good about Gatorade. Gatorade is -- we're moving from historically a liquid for high-performing athletes to an ecosystem of solutions in hydration and fuel for every type of active person. And we're seeing a lot of traction. It's not only Gatorade per se but it's Gatorlyte, it's GFit, it's Propel, it's Muscle Milk, all under 1 umbrella. And it's not only liquid solutions, it's powders, it's tablets, it's equipment, personalized equipment bottles and others. And now we're launching around the Super Bowl, Gatorade iD, which is also an ecosystem of loyalty and I would say, personalization for our consumers that will bring even more attention to the brand and more loyalty with younger consumers. \r\nOn Energy, we're very happy with our portfolio. Obviously, the Starbucks coffee energy on one side, Rockstar and obviously, our collaboration with CELSIUS, which is -- which has been a great success and it provides scale to our go-to-market and kind of a point of entry as well with some of our customers. And then our tea business continues to do very well with Pure Leaf and our Starbucks collaboration now moving more into -- beyond coffee, I would say, more refreshers and some other innovation that Starbucks is developing for their cafes and we bring it ready-to-drink.\r\nSo I think we have a beautiful portfolio. We continue to grow in retail and we're putting a lot of focus in away from home, as we're seeing that the away from home channel is getting much more traffic as people go back to normal mobility and that will be a focus for us going forward. This year, we think we'll continue to grow above the market and continue to gain share in what is a very profitable and high-growth channel. So this is how we're thinking about the business there. And hopefully, it gives you a good sense of the intentionality, how we're thinking about the broad portfolio and our willingness to compete with innovation, with brand investment and with great execution.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.\n\nPeter K. Grom\n\nRamon, I just wanted to ask a follow-up based on your response to both Bryan and Lauren's question on the organic growth. And I may have misheard or could be misinterpreting this but you touched on some of the things that you are doing internally that will drive the improved performance. But I think you also mentioned some sort of assumption around maybe the U.S. consumer would feel better. I mean, if that doesn't happen, would that put the organic revenue guidance at risk? Or would it improve [backdrop], be more of a source of upside versus the greater than 4%?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nThe current assumption is what I said. We think that the consumer will continue to improve in its confidence and its disposable income throughout the year and that's the ongoing assumption. We have a very strong productivity program in the company, which gives us the fuel for investment and it gives us also a lot of flexibility to manage a potential different consumer reality. But at this point, we think this is the ongoing assumptions. We will invest in our brands, we will invest in our innovation. And now that supply chain is in a very good place compared to what it was a couple of years ago, even last year, we can rely on our -- the tools that we're very good at, which is brand building, innovation, execution, distribution increases, strong commercial programs with our partners and that's where we think we'll grow our -- we will drive the growth of our top line.\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nI'd like to add, just to remind you, 40% of our business is now international. So U.S. is significant but we've got a big business outside the U.S.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Wedbush.\n\nGerald John Pascarelli\n\nRamon, I have a question on energy drinks. Can you just speak about your plans to maybe drive performance in Rockstar this year? It's kind of been a relative underperformer in energy drinks for some time. And now you have Bang coming back into the market, which could potentially result in some incremental disruption. So maybe just some color on how you're thinking about driving an improvement in that brand and then maybe broader thoughts on the competitive dynamics within energy drinks this year?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nYes. I mean it's a great question. The energy category continues to grow, as you see above the LRB category. So it continues to expand into new consumers and new consumer occasions, which obviously creates growth for everyone that participates in the category. So we participate, as we've always said, with multiple vectors. We're proud of our Starbucks partnership and some of the products we offer Doubleshot, Tripleshot. We're proud of the Rockstar brand. Rockstar has been growing with the category. More or less, there are some parts of the country where it's well distributed and well preferred. \r\nOther parts of the country, we're trying to get consumer penetration and consumer adoption. The areas where we've been successful with Rockstar, which we will double down, the Zero and the Recover parts of the portfolio. Both of them, if you think, is energy with functionality and where we think our R&D can create advantage. So we're pushing those 2 platforms, Rockstar Zero and Rockstar Recover. And that will continue to be the focus of the brand. \r\nWe've also been focusing on Hispanic consumer. And then also we've seen an increase in the penetration of the brand with the Hispanic population, with Hispanic consumers, will continue to drive that commercial activity. But we see this as a portfolio of solutions, including CELSIUS and how we -- the combined portfolio creates a very good point of execution for us as multibrand. It gives us an entry into convenience stores and some other points of sale away from home. And we'll continue to drive the portfolio as the unit of execution.\r\nForgot, maybe I can say, the other thing we're doing with Rockstar, which we don't talk a lot but it's an important part of our growth, is we're launching Rockstar internationally in many markets around the world, from Asia to Europe, to parts of Latin America. And we're having good success. Again, as a portfolio of solutions that complements our Sting brand that we have in Asia or some other brands that we have in Europe as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\n\nRobert Bain Moskow\n\nIn your prepared remarks, you said that you expect less commodity inflation but some agricultural inputs might be higher. Can you be more specific? And I was hoping if you could focus a little on Frito because there's a very big potato crop this past year, vegetable oil costs are coming down. Do you see any relief on the horizon for Frito in that regard?\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nRob, it's Jamie. Yes, that is the practice. We comment on the basket of inputs. We don't comment on specific commodity movement but you're absolutely correct that we do expect commodity inflation to moderate from what we had in '23.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\n\nAndrea Faria Teixeira\n\nAnd great having you back, Jamie, on the investor-facing mode. I have 1 question and then a clarification. First, for Ramon, I was hoping to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you're going to be lapping. And if you have a red lap, the mix drags and the shift from -- away from -- to away from home and where your market share is not probably as strong as in snacks as you have in at-home channels. And given your strong gross margin delivery in your experience in negotiating with large box retailers, especially in Europe, are retailers asking you to invest back in promo rollbacks given your gross margin delivery and productivity gains, in particular in North America and Europe? And my clarification for Jamie is, in terms of like your organic sales growth and EPS cadence for the year, anything we should be considering on your guide as far as cadence?\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nYes. So on the organic sales growth, first of all, Andrea, it's great to hear your voice again and look forward to interacting as we go forward. Organic sales growth cadence, I'd say, back half stronger than the first half. As we talked about before, we've got the impact of -- the Quaker recall is going to be front half loaded. The laps get easier as we get into the back half of the year. And then some of these consumer pressures that have existed with elimination of stimulus benefits, resumption of student loan payments. We'll lap those as we get into the year.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nYes. Andrea, listen, the -- with regards to the customer, I think we're all trying to build win-win plans, in the sense that we grow the business and we create profit growth for both our customers and ourselves. We normally -- we have always the consumer at the center. So it will be a combination of how we generate growth through, as I said, innovation and we have a few big innovations and brand relaunches this year. We put a lot of investment there together with our customers. We'll continue to try to expand our SKUs with the customers and there will be investments there. And there will be some investments in trying to give more value to consumers in a very holistic way, right, through pack price, through promotions, through consumer events that eventually will drive preference for our brands. But that's the way we're thinking about creating this joint business, planning with our large customers that create growth for the category growth for our customers and growth for us. \r\nWith regards to away from home -- sorry, I forgot, Andrea. The away from home, we see it as an and, not as an or. So we see as an opportunity for us to continue to be in consumers' lives always everywhere. And as consumers pivot away from home, we'll try to be there for them. It's been an area of investment for us, both in distribution and specific solutions for away from home for quite some time. And we're seeing our businesses in the large markets, growing above the market in away from home. So clearly, this will be an opportunity for us for many years to come. And I think we're getting better at mixology. We're getting better at more food experiences, Walking Taco, Doritos Loaded. We're testing food trucks. We're testing many things that will make our brands available to consumers in -- beyond what is a packaged bag or a can or a bottle. Now I think consumers are expecting from us away from home a much more holistic experience and that's where we're working on. And I think we're making good progress.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.\n\nRobert Edward Ottenstein\n\nGreat. A little bit more of a detailed question on PBNA. And just want to talk about Gatorade and CELSIUS. So in terms of Gatorade, could you just remind us in terms of the timing of the move to DSD and how that impacted your income statement? And then in terms of CELSIUS, obviously, the brand has done phenomenally well. It's getting pretty big now. Can you talk about how CELSIUS impacts the income statement in the U.S.? And then how your relationship with the company has evolved, you talked about taking Rockstar internationally. CELSIUS is doing some -- going international now. Are you part of that plan as well?\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nYes. So on Gatorade, we're 90% through on the transition. Obviously, that move is positive to the financial results overall. That's what we did, is the enhanced performance and we're happy with the margins we have on that business. On CELSIUS, the way that works is, we're sharing the system revenue with CELSIUS.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nYes. Listen, we're happy with the collaboration with CELSIUS and that continues to be a part of our growth strategy. There is an opportunity for us to collaborate in the international expansion as well. At this point, it's not, I would say, a scaled opportunity, is a market-by-market opportunity in very particular markets. So yes, we're contemplating that as an option and we're having conversations with CELSIUS, how we can leverage the PepsiCo system for a bigger expansion, nothing short term, I would say, at this point.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\n\nChristopher Michael Carey\n\nSo I just wanted to ask about SG&A over the past 4 years. We've talked about this before in this forum but with the annual disclosures now out, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic. So specifically, Ramon, can you help contextualize the increase that we've seen in SG&A over the past 4 years, specifically, distribution cost. I'm really curious about maybe how much of this is underlying inflation as opposed to discretionary investments that PepsiCo is making? And I'm not really looking for a specific number per se. I realize that's probably difficult but distribution is up 40% over the past 4 years. And I'm just wondering how much of this is within your control, maybe some of the capabilities that you've been able to build over this time frame and maybe get a sense of how this line item should be trending going forward?\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nYes. So as you point out, selling and distribution is the biggest part of that. The A part is less so. And it's going to be a reflection of what you see is; one, you've got market mix or sector mix components in there. We've driven a lot of productivity in our OpEx. But at the same time, we're investing in OpEx to drive distribution and growth in the business.\n\nRavi Pamnani\n\nOne other thing, Chris, that you should be mindful of is, we do have a big direct store delivery business. So we've had inflation in various things like labor and so forth and that's what's gone up. A&M has gone up as well, which is also kind of all part of that SG&A bucket. We've made numerous capability investments in there as well. So it's all of the above. I wouldn't hone in just on the distribution costs, which I know you focus on from the 10-K. There's a lot of buckets that go in that are far deeper that we can't get into for competitive reasons.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.\n\nFilippo Falorni\n\nSo Ramon and Jamie, you both mentioned the organic sales growth guidance is going to be more second half weighted. And I know you don't provide breakdown on guidance on volumes. But given the importance of volume trends, can you give us a sense of how you see volumes evolving? Is there a possibility in your guidance where you see positive volumes in the second half of the year? \r\nAnd then on the pricing front, maybe you can give us a sense of what you're assuming in terms of pricing? I assume in the U.S. or developed markets, it's limited and there's more pricing in emerging market. But any color on pricing will be also helpful.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nYes. I think you should be thinking about -- we want to grow units next year. We will see profitable volume growth next year. And you'll see a more balance between pricing and volume that you have seen in previous year where obviously, we had to cover a huge commodity increase and OpEx increase. As commodities kind of normalize and OpEx inflation normalizes, that lever will be less necessary outside of what has been a normal pricing levels of our category in the 2% to 3%. So you should be thinking about profitable volume growth and more of a normalized pricing compared to what it was in the '18 and '19 time frame.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nI wanted to build upon Chris' question, please and ask you about the A&M buckets and the spending behind your brands. I think the K shows advertising up around 10% year-on-year and that's around a 20 basis points increase as a percentage of sales. But we're still quite a long way below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of sales and comfortably below the average over the last several years. So I guess the question is, are your brands getting enough support? And do we need to see upward pressure on advertising spend as a percentage of sales over the coming years?\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nThat's great. Good point. Obviously, in absolute terms, we have much more A&M. So I think we have increased, last year it was $500 million. And if you think about a longer time frame, a meaningful over $1 billion increase in absolute A&M. So that's absolute dollars that go against our business. We're thinking about continuing that trend, continuing to support both our large brands across multiple markets and then smaller brands where we take the portfolio into the future. So that should be composition of our A&M. \r\nNow when you look at the last few years, you should bear in mind, we stopped advertising in Russia, which was a meaningful market for us. So that is reflected in our absolute numbers or relative numbers. So that you should contemplate about. But as a -- if you think about where and how we're going to create demand in the future, you should be thinking about A&M continue to increase. Obviously, we'll look at ways to optimize A&M and we have very strong measures on ROI and various ways to invest in our brands. But you should be thinking about us as a company that continues to build brands, continues to innovate, continue to create value through investment in consumer. \r\nAnd obviously, we also create a lot of demand through our push model. To some of the questions that was asked before, you should be thinking about our selling and distribution cost, not only as a cost but also as a way for us to execute very granularly across millions and millions of points of sale around the world where we reach the final point of sale and we create, I would say, visibility for our brands and impulse for our brands, which are relevant, if you think about the categories where we compete.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\n\nStephen Robert R. Powers\n\nGreat. Jamie, add me to the list of people excited to work with you again. Actually, this question may be for you and probably is for you. On these calls for the last several years that we've been talking about on and off, just sort of the cash flow profile of the business and the capital investments that have been made in the business and the path eventually back towards a higher level of free cash flow conversion. I guess acknowledging that you've been there in the room the whole time, I guess, now as you assume the role of CFO, do you see any opportunities to speed that process of cash flow generation and a return to higher levels of free cash flow conversion from where we've been trending? Or is it more steady state? And if you could just give us a little perspective on how you're seeing those -- that cash flow profile of the business evolving from here, that would be great.\n\nJames Caulfield\n\nYes. So clearly, cash flow continues to be a priority. I'd focus on CapEx and we've been very intentional about the levels of capital we've invested in the business. Part of that was to catch up on capacity. We're currently in the midst of big investments in IT and digitalization but over time, I think you'll see the level of CapEx as a percent of sales begin to trend down and that will help with the cash flow conversion.\n\nRamon Luis Laguarta\n\nGreat. So thank you, everybody. I'm glad everybody is happy that Jamie is back and I see a lot of bonding, great.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best big company stocks to buy. To skip the latest news and analysts\u2019 sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nDespite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn\u2019t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\n\n\u201cAs we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.\n\nDespite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9. 13 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\nA large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 910 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That\u2019s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\n13. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company that manufactures and distributes semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\n\nOn January 24, ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) announced an interim dividend of EUR 1.45 per share, which is payable by February 14.\n\nASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is one of the best big company stocks to buy, along with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nClearBridge Investments stated the following regarding ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAnother welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.\n\nOn an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.\u201d\n\n12. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)\n\nMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a New Jersey-based company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets prescription medicines, vaccines, animal health products, etc.\n\nOn February 5, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced that it would buy the aqua business from Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE:ELAN) for $1.3 billion in cash. The deal is expected to be finalized by mid-2024, and the company will get two manufacturing facilities in Canada and Vietnam and a research facility in Chile as part of the deal.\n\nOn February 1, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.03, topping the estimates by $0.14. The revenue of the quarter grew by 6% YoY to $14.6 billion, surpassing the estimates by $120 million.\n\nCarillon Tower Advisers made the following comment about Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cMerck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) underperformed in the third quarter, based on what we view as largely macroeconomic-related factors. The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.\u201d\n\n11. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is a North Carolina-based company that offers various services, including wealth management services, credit and debit cards, and more.\n\nOn January 30, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck upgraded Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and increased the price target to $41 from $32.\n\nOn January 31, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by March 29 to the shareholders of record on March 1. At the time of writing on February 9, the stock\u2019s dividend yield was 2.91%.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 88 hedge funds had investments in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\u2019s stock in the third quarter. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway was the most significant stakeholder in the company and owned 1.03 billion company shares worth $28.28 billion.\n\n10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a California-based company that provides subscription video-on-demand over-the-top streaming service in more than 190 countries.\n\nOn January 26, Argus raised the price target on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\u2019s stock to $660 from $575 and maintained a Buy rating. Highlighting the company\u2019s Q4 results, the analyst mentioned the company\u2019s emphasis on stopping password-sharing, an advertising-supported service plan, and more.\n\nOn January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) posted its Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11. The revenue of $8.83 billion jumped 12.5% YoY, which beat the analysts\u2019 estimates by $120 million.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix\u2019s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user\u2019s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based company that discovers, develops, and markets human healthcare products.\n\nOn February 6, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) posted its Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $2.49, which beat the estimates by $0.12. The revenue of $9.35 billion grew 28.1% YoY, topping the estimates by $380 million.\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) was mentioned in Baron Funds\u2019 fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n\u201cStock selection was also positive in the sub-industry owing to strong gains from therapeutics-focused pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly\u2019s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company\u2019s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas. Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company\u2019s obesity and diabetes franchises. We continue to think Lilly is well positioned to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.\n\nWe own Eli Lilly and Company, which we believe will remain a leader in the GLP-1 medicine class with Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the company\u2019s deep pipeline of next generation GLP-1 medicines.\u201d\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a California-based company that develops and sells semiconductor products and devices.\n\nOver the last three months, 34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the shares. At the time of writing on February 9, the average price target of $194.16 represented an upside of 12.79%.\n\nIn the third quarter, 110 hedge funds held a stake in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\u2019s stock, compared to 112 hedge funds in the previous quarter, but the total stake value increased to $9.156 billion in Q3, up from $6.93 billion in Q2. Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company, with 27.768 million shares worth $2.855 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 \u2013 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover \u2013 performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get \u2018lucky\u2019 investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).\u201d\n\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in\u00a0 Omaha, Nebraska. Through its subsidiaries, it offers various services like freight rail transportation, finance, and more. Most of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\u2019s revenue is generated from its insurance business.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in the third quarter, as 116 hedge funds had investments in the stock, up from 109 in the prior quarter.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is our seventh best big company stock to buy.\n\n6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based company that offers customer relationship management software and applications to customers worldwide. With 122 hedge fund investors, the company occupies the sixth spot on our list.\n\nOn January 23, Baird analyst Rob Oliver increased the price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\u2019s stock to $310 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the best big company stocks to buy, besides Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nPolen Capital stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIn the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Highest-Paid Women CEOs 12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Shares of PepsiCo (PEP) are declining on Friday after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter results. PepsiCo posted revenue of $27.8 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $28.3 billion. However, the company exceeded earnings expectations, delivering adjusted EPS of $1.78 against forecasts of $1.72.\n\nYahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Finally, let's get a check of shares of Pepsi here, fizzling. Oh, nice. Get that? Fizzling this afternoon as it posted mixed results for the fourth quarter, missing on those revenue numbers. CEO saying that US sales broadly slowed down in the fourth quarter, down more than 3% here. So snacks and soft drinks, Pepsi reports investors disappointed. Earnings beat relative to expectations. Revenue was light, it looks like. The forecast not great either, Julie.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, the culprit seems to be Pepsi raised prices too much. Raised them too much, too fast, for too broad an array of products. And now the company is saying it's going to be not doing that as much, but that seems to be really a big issue here for Pepsi. We were asking for so long when are customers going to push back against price increases across a broad array of products. Pepsi has given us one answer here.\n\nOne other minor thing or other detail here, analysts pointing to weakness in Quaker Foods, in particular, as a reason for disappointment. So that's something else that bears watching.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, sales growth should be at least 4%, they're saying, on an organic basis in 2024. That was not good enough. The Street wanted to see closer to 5%. And by the way, Coca-Cola reports next week.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, so we'll see if this is a harbinger for Coca-Cola.",

Michael Bow reports:\n\nAdministrators to the fund, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), secured legal backing for a scheme on Friday that will compensate investors who lost out in 2019.\n\nHowever, campaigners argue that the deal is not good enough because they believe investors deserve more compensation.\n\nMr Woodford\u2019s fund collapsed after he was hit by a wave of redemptions, forcing the company to block people from taking their money out.\n\nLFS was blamed for mismanaging the liquidity of the funds.\n\nIt agreed with UK regulators to pay compensation to around 250,000 of Woodford\u2019s investors but LFS denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMore than 90pc of Woodford\u2019s investors voted for the deal when it was proposed last year.\n\nContinue to read the full story...

Ultimately, it meant that the resulting products were ideal for mobile phones and, as we are now seeing, data centre servers.\n\nARM was floated on Nasdaq in New York last September.

Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains Pepsico\u2019s problem:\n\nMissing your own targets isn\u2019t a good thing, and this surprise on the downside has seen the shares fall in pre-market trading. Unlike major rival Coca-Cola, the group doesn\u2019t limit itself to just soft drinks. Pepsi sells snack favourites like Walkers crisps, Doritos and Cheetos to help customers work up a thirst. But these have also shown signs of struggle over the second half.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the slowing rate of sales growth is what\u2019s causing concern among investors. Pepsi has a diverse portfolio of strong brands, but constant price hikes have taken their toll and had a negative impact on both drink and food volumes.\n\nCost-cutting initiatives have continued at pace, helping to offset some of the impacts of slightly lower volumes and keep profits growing at double-digit rates.\n\nBut cost cuts are more like a plaster than a longer-term treatment. Heading into the new year, as cost inflation eases, price hikes should also slow. Investors will hope this breathes life back into demand and allows growth to come from a healthier and more sustainable mix between price and volume.

While we expect management will want to rebuild this cash buffer over future periods, the reduction isn\u2019t as alarming as the headline reduction suggests.\n\nManagement have pointed to a number of green shoots across the business: build cost inflation is moderating, the mortgage market is improving for borrowers, and interest in Bellway\u2019s homes is increasing. However, that interest is expected to mostly be reflected in the next financial year\u2019s results, meaning FY 2024 (to July-24) is likely to be one to forget.\n\n08:07 AM GMT\n\nUK markets subdued after Wall Street records\n\nStock markets in London were relatively quiet at the open as investors sobered up from the record-breaking run on Wall Street.\n\nThe FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,598.24 while the midcap FTSE 250 gained less than 0.1pc to 19,117.31.\n\n08:04 AM GMT\n\nTesco to receive \u00a31bn under Barclays banking takeover\n\nTesco has said in its own statement that it expects to receive total of about \u00a31bn in cash from the sale of its retail banking division to Barclays.\n\nIt will receive \u00a3600m in proceeds and another \u00a3100m after the passing of some regulatory hurdles.\n\nThis would be combined with a previously announced special dividend of \u00a3250m paid by Tesco Bank in August 2023.\n\nIt said the majority of this cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of an incremental share buyback.\n\n07:55 AM GMT\n\nBellway house sales plunge by nearly a third\n\nHouse builder Bellway revealed a slump in sales over the last six months but said it had been encouraged by the easing of mortgage costs.\n\nThe developer said revenues slumped 30pc to \u00a31.3bn as it built 4,092 homes, down 28pc on the 5,695 built during the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe average selling price fell to \u00a3309,300, down from \u00a3316,929.\n\nChief executive said Jason Honeyman said:\n\nBellway has delivered another resilient performance in a period of challenging trading conditions.\n\nWhile the economic backdrop remains uncertain, the gradual reduction in mortgage interest rates through the first half has eased affordability constraints and we are encouraged by the seasonal pick-up in customer leads and an improvement in reservations since the start of the new calendar year.\n\nWe have maintained balance sheet resilience and, supported by the strength of our land bank, Bellway remains well-placed to capitalise on future growth opportunities and will continue to play an important role in increasing housing supply in the years ahead.\n\n07:49 AM GMT\n\nGerman inflation tumbles as downturn grips country\n\nGerman inflation fell as expected last month giving some relief to the nation after a nightmare week of economic data.\n\nThe consumer prices index fell to 2.9pc in January, down from 3.7pc over the course of 2023.\n\nThe inflation figures cap off a tumultuous week of economic data for Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nGermany\u2019s construction sector suffered some of its worst declines on record in January, while its private sector services businesses suffered their worst performance in five months.\n\nGerman industrial production fell for a seventh straight month in December, official data showed, marking its longest series of declines since the period after reunification in the early 1990s.\n\nFigures also showed that in 2023, German house prices suffered their steepest decline in 60 years as higher interest rates hammered home buyers.\n\nMeanwhile, Ford has agreed with union chiefs to cut about 2,700 jobs from a German plant as it switches electric vehicle production to Spain.

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Miss",
        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. PEP has reported robust fourth-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate and declined year over year.\r\n\r\nThe results reflect gains from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. However, soft volumes hurt the top line.\r\n\r\nPEP shares declined 2.1% in the pre-market session following the earnings release on Feb 9, owing to soft fourth-quarter sales results. Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 4.1% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s 7.4% growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter core EPS of $1.78 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 and increased 6.6% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 9% from the year-ago period, backed by the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The company\u2019s reported EPS of 94 cents rose 152% year over year in the quarter. Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 2% in the quarter.\r\n\r\nNet revenues of $27,850 million declined 0.5% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28,242 million. Revenues were impacted by a unit volume decline of 3% for the convenient food business and were down 2% for the beverage business. This was partly offset by an improved price/mix in the reported quarter. Foreign currency impacted revenues by 1.5%.\r\n\r\nOn an organic basis, revenues grew 4.5% year over year, driven by growth across categories and geographies. The consolidated organic volume was down 4%, while effective net pricing improved 9% in the fourth quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted organic revenue growth of 6.2% for the fourth quarter, with a 9.6% gain from price/mix and a 3.5% decline in volume.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nOn a consolidated basis, the reported gross profit increased 1.2% year over year to $14,753 million. The core gross profit rose 1.3% year over year to $14,898 million. The reported gross margin expanded 91 basis points (bps), whereas the core gross margin expanded 97 bps.\r\n\r\nWe anticipated the core gross margin to expand 30 bps to 52.8%. In dollar terms, core gross profit was expected to increase 1.4% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe reported operating income of $1,683 million rose 106% year over year. The core operating income grew 8.7% year over year to $3,185 million and the core constant-currency operating income improved 10%. The reported operating margin expanded 313 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 97 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies.\r\n\r\nOur model predicted core SG&A expenses of $11.9 billion, which indicated year-over-year growth of 1.1%. As a percentage of sales, core SG&A expenses were anticipated at 42.1%, flat with the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nWe expected a core operating margin of 10.6%, with a 10-bps expansion from the year-ago quarter\u2019s actual.\n\nSegmental Details\n\nThe company witnessed revenue declines across most segments. Organic revenues improved for all segments, except for QFNA and APAC.\r\n\r\nRevenues, on a reported basis, declined 3% year over year in FLNA, 16% in QFNA, 2% in PBNA, 1% in Europe, 4% in AMESA, and 2% in APAC. However, revenues improved 18% in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Organic revenues increased 3% for FLNA, 3% for PBNA, 8% for Latin America, 10% for Europe, and 11% for AMESA. Organic revenues declined 10% for QFNA and 1% for APAC.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe company ended 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $9,711 million, long-term debt of $35,595 million, and shareholders\u2019 equity (excluding non-controlling interest) of $18,503 million.\r\n\r\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $13,442 million as of Dec 30, 2023, compared with $10,811 million as of Dec 31, 2022.\n\nOutlook\n\nPepsiCo outlined its view for 2024. The company expects organic revenue growth of at least 4% for 2024. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of at least 8% from the year-ago period\u2019s reported figure.\r\n\r\nPEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and core EPS by 1 percentage point in 2024, based on the current rates. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2024.\r\n\r\nBased on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects a core EPS of at least $8.15 for 2024. This suggests a 7% increase from the core EPS of $7.62 reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return a value worth $8.2 billion in 2024, including $7.2 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1.0 billion in 2024.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss These Better-Ranked Stocks\n\nWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, The Boston Beer Company SAM and Molson Coors TAP.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola FEMSA currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is about 2.3% away from its peak.\n\nU.S. monthly consumer prices rose less than initially estimated in December, revised government data showed on Friday.\n\nThe consumer price index rose 0.2% in December instead of 0.3% as reported last month, annual revisions of the CPI data published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. But data for November was revised up to show the CPI increasing 0.2% rather than 0.1% as previously estimated.\n\n\"I would say today's revisions are much more modest than they were last year,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. \"There's much less of an overarching concern in the marketplace about the actual data now that we know what the revised numbers look like.\"\n\nKeeping a lid on gains, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes reversed their earlier drop and rose to 4.18%.\n\nStrong economic data and hawkish comments from Fed policymakers in recent weeks have pushed back traders' bets that the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates in March.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are now awaiting January consumer prices data, scheduled for release next week, for a clearer picture of where rates are headed this year.\n\nAt 9:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.24 points, or 0.05%, at 38,706.09, the S&P 500 was up 7.42 points, or 0.15%, at 5,005.33, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 53.27 points, or 0.34%, at 15,846.99.\n\nThe three main indexes were set for their fifth consecutive week of gains as upbeat earnings reports offset jitters around the interest-rate path and concerns about U.S. regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate.\n\nThe tech sector was up 0.4% and led sectoral gains, helped by a 1.5% rise in Nvidia after Reuters reported that the chipmaker is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence processors.\n\nPepsiCo lost 3.4% after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates as multiple price hikes crimped demand for its juices and Lay's crisps.\n\nPinterest plunged 11.6% after it forecast first-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, while Cloudflare rallied 20.1% as it forecast upbeat first-quarter revenue and profit.\n\nWith the U.S. earnings season past the halfway mark, more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies topped profit estimates in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG data. In a typical quarter, 67% of companies beat estimates.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 27 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 74 new highs and 19 new lows.

For more on the results, we go to Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi. Here with Sozz, you spoke with PepsiCo CEO.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Look, investors snacking on shares of PepsiCo, right?\n\nBRAD SMITH: Yeah, OK.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Get it? Friday humor, no? OK, well, anyway this is like an initial--\n\nSEANA SMITH: I liked it.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: This is initial change because PepsiCo shares initially bid down in response to these results and it made sense. Going through tick by tick, the company missed on sales, North American beverage unit, it's important Frito-Lay division markets. And PepsiCo investors never like to see anything related to any weakness with Frito-Lay.\n\nThe Quaker business also had some challenges. Volume declined in all segments and I think inflation, guys, was a little bit stickier than a lot of investors expected. That really impacting a lot of divisions of their business, whether it's sugar prices, corn prices, whatever it is. I think that weighed on profits by division.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo I caught up with PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta who we just talked to a couple of weeks ago at Davos. I mean he struck an upbeat tone on the health of the US consumer. Did acknowledge maybe some pockets of weakness, lower income consumers perhaps gravitating towards more affordable, smaller pack sizes, whatever it is, I think he's still optimistic on the consumer this year.\n\nI think I would take this quarter by PepsiCo like this. These are some of the best operators in the entire stock market. So when PepsiCo comes out here and maybe reports a mixed quarter, there was some little concern about the guidance.\n\nYou know, how good was that revenue outlook? How good or how high quality was that earnings outlook? They're likely to come out here, trim some expenses this year, get margins to where they need to be, deliver on earnings. Pepsi hates not delivering on its earnings expectations and they really hate not delivering above their earnings expectations.\n\nSo not a perfect quarter from the company. Jefferies out with a note this morning saying it was an OK quarter. I would agree with that. But again, the market has taken, I think, a wait and see approach as that conference call rages on.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Brian, what do you think just about their approach to pricing so far? Obviously, they have been forced to raise prices facing those inflationary pressures. But from your conversations, even beyond what you were just talking with PepsiCo here this morning, but how CEOs are kind of walking that fine line, right? They need to raise prices to boost their margins. But then again, they're also a bit handicapped because the consumer, on the other hand, is under pressure.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: I think the first instinct is, yes-- first, look, all these food companies have raised prices aggressively since the pandemic. They had to because their own costs of doing businesses are going up. They're public companies. They have earnings and investor expectations to meet, whatever it is.\n\nBut they've also raised prices by maybe taking a couple of chips out of the bag. I'm not saying PepsiCo necessarily is doing this widespread, but this is what food makers do. It's called shrinkflation. Taking couple chips out of the bag, maybe pumping in a little more air, whatever it is, that is one way for them to raise the price on their products.\n\nI think PepsiCo has really focused this year on small pack sizes and using that as a lever to get a lot of pressure consumers into the business. But by and large, given the inflation that they saw, given some of the pressures that they did see on sales, this wasn't a bad quarter. It was just not one of those good old fashioned blowout Pepsi quarters.",

The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed less than 2% away from its peak on Thursday.\n\nU.S. monthly consumer prices rose less than initially estimated in December, revised government data showed on Friday.\n\nThe consumer price index rose 0.2% in December instead of 0.3% as reported last month, annual revisions of the CPI data published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. But data for November was revised up to show the CPI increasing 0.2% rather than 0.1% as previously estimated.\n\n\"I would say today's revisions are much more modest than they were last year,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. \"There's much less of an overarching concern in the marketplace about the actual data now that we know what the revised numbers look like.\"\n\nStrong economic data and hawkish comments from Fed policymakers in recent weeks have pushed back traders' bets that the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates in March.\n\nInvestors are now awaiting January consumer prices data, scheduled for release next week, for a clearer picture of where rates are headed this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 78 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 14.25 points, or 0.28%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 65.75 points, or 0.37%.\n\nThe three main indexes were set for their fifth consecutive week of gains as upbeat earnings reports offset jitters around the interest-rate path and concerns about U.S. regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate.\n\nWith the U.S. earnings season past the halfway mark, more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies topped profit estimates in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG data. In a typical quarter, 67% of companies beat estimates.\n\nPepsiCo edged up 0.3% premarket after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates as multiple price hikes crimped demand for its juices and Lay's crisps.\n\nPinterest plunged 8.5% after it forecast first-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, a sign that it faces tough competition from larger social media players, even as the digital advertising market stabilizes.\n\nCloudflare rallied 24.0% as it forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above market estimates, betting on strong demand for its cloud and content delivery services.\n\nExpedia fell 16% after the online travel platform warned revenue in 2024 would moderate as air ticket prices drop and said CEO Peter Kern was stepping down.\n\nCrypto stocks such as Coinbase, Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital rose between 8.7% and 11.9% as bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, hit its highest level since the launch of spot ETFs.

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.78 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.67 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.49%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food and beverage company would post earnings of $2.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.25, delivering a surprise of 3.69%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nPepsiCo , which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, posted revenues of $27.85 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.39%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $28 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPepsiCo shares have added about 2.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 4.8%.\n\nWhat's Next for PepsiCo?\n\nWhile PepsiCo has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PepsiCo: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.62 on $18.54 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $8.11 on $96.14 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Beverages - Soft drinks is currently in the top 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Coca-Cola (KO), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2023. The results are expected to be released on February 13.\n\nThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nCoca-Cola's revenues are expected to be $10.64 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Net Revenue Growth: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) reported a 5.9% increase in full-year net revenue. Organic Revenue Growth: Organic revenue grew by 9.5% for the full year.

Dividend Increase: Announced a 7% increase in annualized dividend, marking the 52nd consecutive annual increase. 2024 Financial Outlook: PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) expects at least 4% organic revenue growth and 8% core constant currency EPS growth for 2024. Share Repurchase: Plans to repurchase approximately $1 billion worth of shares.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with PEP.\n\nOn February 9, 2024, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) released its 8-K filing, detailing its financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. Despite a slight decline in fourth-quarter net revenue performance by 0.5%, the company achieved a 5.9% increase in full-year net revenue. This growth is attributed to a strong 9.5% rise in organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, and divestitures.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry, with a portfolio that includes iconic brands such as Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos. The company has a significant presence in both the savory snacks and non-alcoholic beverages markets, with convenience foods accounting for approximately 55% of total revenue and beverages making up the remainder. PepsiCo operates a substantial manufacturing and distribution network across the United States and internationally, with 40% of total sales and one-third of operating profits stemming from international markets.\n\nPerformance and Challenges\n\nThe company's performance in 2023 reflects its resilience in the face of inflation, macroeconomic volatility, geopolitical tensions, and international conflicts. Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed satisfaction with the results, crediting the company's investments in strengthening the business and advancing the pep+ agenda. However, challenges such as the Quaker Foods North America recall and the impact of the 53rd reporting week have affected certain divisions' performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nLaguarta emphasized the company's confidence in its ability to perform well in 2024, with category growth rates normalizing and inflationary pressures expected to abate. PepsiCo's focus will be on offering consumers great-tasting products that provide convenience and value, managing costs, and investing in brands, innovation, channel expansion, and the pep+ transformation.\n\nFinancial Achievements and Outlook\n\nThe company's financial achievements, including the increase in annualized dividend and share repurchase plan, underscore its commitment to delivering shareholder value. The 2024 financial outlook projects continued growth, with at least 4% organic revenue growth and 8% core constant currency EPS growth anticipated.\n\nThe company's ability to maintain a strong dividend track record and execute share buybacks reflects its solid financial position and confidence in future earnings potential. These achievements are particularly significant for a company in the competitive non-alcoholic beverages industry, where innovation and market adaptation are crucial for sustained growth.\n\nAnalysis of Financial Performance\n\nPepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)'s financial performance in 2023 demonstrates the company's strategic focus on pricing, productivity, and cost management, which has helped offset the impacts of higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The company's operating profit and EPS growth, particularly in core constant currency terms, indicate a robust underlying business performance that has managed to navigate a challenging economic environment effectively.\n\nAs PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) looks ahead to 2024, the company's guidance suggests a positive trajectory, with growth expected in both organic revenue and core EPS. The planned share repurchases and dividend increase further signal the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and its confidence in the financial strength and future prospects of the business.\n\nFor a detailed breakdown of PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)'s financial results and further insights into the company's performance, please refer to the full 8-K filing.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from PepsiCo Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

It has raised prices by double-digit percentages for several quarters.\n\nGlobal supermarket chain Carrefour said last month that it will stop selling PepsiCo products in its stores in France, Belgium, Spain and Italy due to price increases for popular items like Lay\u2019s potato chips, Quaker Oats, Lipton Iced Tea and its namesake soda.\n\nPepsiCo said at the time that it would continue to engage in good faith with Carrefour to try to ensure that it products remained available.\n\nIts profits are up, though higher prices have dragged down sales as people trade down to cheaper brands. PepsiCo has been shrinking package sizes of some products in that environment.\n\nPepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, New York, has said price increases should ease and largely align with inflation, which has fallen considerably.\n\nPepsiCo has pointed to higher costs for grain and cooking oil as it has raised prices. Costs for those food commodities surged following Russia\u2019s invasion in Ukraine but have since retreated on global markets from record highs in 2022.\n\nThe company's stock fell more than 2% before the market open.",

In a typical quarter, 67% of companies beat estimates.\n\nPepsiCo slipped 1.3% premarket after its fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates as multiple price hikes crimped demand for its juices and Lay's crisps.\n\nPinterest plunged 10.4% after it forecast first-quarter revenue largely below Wall Street estimates, a sign that it faces tough competition from larger social media players even as the digital advertising market stabilizes.\n\nCloudflare rallied 25.5% as it forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above market estimates, betting on strong demand for its cloud and content delivery services.\n\nExpedia fell 13.9% after the online travel platform warned that revenue in 2024 would moderate as air ticket prices drop and said CEO Peter Kern was stepping down.

Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $27.85 billion vs analyst estimates of $28.37 billion (1.8% miss) EPS: $0.94 vs analyst expectations of $1.73 (45.5% miss) Guidance for 2024 organic revenue of at least 4% year on year growth vs analyst estimates of up 4.9% year on year Guidance for 2024 EPS of at least $8.15 vs analyst estimates of $8.15, meaning guidance is better than expectations since it states a minimum level in line with expectations Free Cash Flow of $2.83 billion, down 38.3% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 53%, up from 52.3% in the same quarter last year Organic Revenue was up 4.5% year on year\u00a0(miss vs. expectations of up 5.0% year on year) Sales Volumes were down 4% year on year Market Capitalization: $241.9 billion\n\nWith a history that goes back more than a century, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is a household name in food and beverages today and best known for its flagship soda.\n\nBeverages and Alcohol\n\nThe beverages and alcohol category encompasses companies engaged in the production, distribution, and sale of refreshments like beer, wine, and spirits, along with soft drinks, juices, and bottled water. These companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the explosion of alcoholic craft beer drinks or the steady decline of non-alcoholic sugary sodas. The industry is highly competitive, with a diverse range of products from large multinational corporations, niche brands, and startups vying for market share. It's also subject to varying degrees of government regulation and taxation, especially for alcoholic beverages.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales Growth\n\nPepsiCo is one of the most widely recognized consumer staples companies in the world. Its influence over consumers gives it extremely high negotiating leverage with distributors, enabling it to pick and choose where it sells its products (a luxury many don't have).\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 9.1% over the last three years was decent despite consumers buying less of its products. We'll explore what this means in the \"Volume Growth\" section. PepsiCo Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, PepsiCo missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.5% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $27.85 billion in revenue. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 5.1% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nOur recent pick has been a big winner, and the stock is up more than 2,000% since the IPO a decade ago. If you didn\u2019t buy then, you have another chance today. The business is much less risky now than it was in the years after going public. The company is a clear market leader in a huge, growing $200 billion market. Its $7 billion of revenue only scratches the surface. Its products are mission critical. Virtually no customers ever left the company. You can find it on our platform for free.\n\nCash Is King\n\nIf you've followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\nPepsiCo's free cash flow came in at $2.83 billion in Q4, up 52.7% year on year. This result represents a 10.2% margin. PepsiCo Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nOver the last two years, PepsiCo has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some reinvestment opportunities. The company's free cash flow margin has averaged 6.7%, slightly better than the broader consumer staples sector. Furthermore, its margin has averaged year-on-year increases of 2.2 percentage points over the last 12 months. This likely pleases the company's investors.\n\nKey Takeaways from PepsiCo's Q4 Results\n\nIt was encouraging to see PepsiCo slightly top analysts' full-year earnings guidance expectations. That stood out as a positive in these results. On the other hand, its organic revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations and its operating margin missed Wall Street's estimates. Guidance for full year organic revenue called for growth of at least 4% while analysts' estimates call for 4.9% growth. Full year EPS will be \"at least\" $8.15, and with Consensus at $8.15, this portion of guidance can be viewed as better. Overall, the results were mixed. The company is down 1.2% on the results and currently trades at $171.9 per share.\n\nPepsiCo may not have had the best quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry and with revenue growth of 50% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.",

        "content": "(Reuters) -PepsiCo reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales and forecast a sharp slowdown in organic revenue growth for 2024, in signs that multiple price hikes could be weighing on demand for its beverages and Lay's crisps.\n\nThe company's shares were down about 2% before the bell on Friday.\n\nPepsiCo shielded its margins by passing on higher production costs to its customers for almost two years, but now faces slowing demand even for sodas and snacks tagged as \"affordable luxuries.\"\n\nIn January, Carrefour, Europe's largest food retailer, asserted it would not be stocking PepsiCo's brands \"due to unacceptable price increases\".\n\nPepsiCo's fourth-quarter revenue fell 0.5% to $27.85 billion, the first drop in 14 quarters. Analysts had expected a 1.4% rise to $28.40 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe number of units sold by the company's beverage business in the U.S. fell 8% in November and was down 7% in October and December, according to YipitData.\n\nAverage prices jumped 9% in the quarter ended Dec. 30, PepsiCo said, while organic volume slipped 4%.\n\n\"The volumes again are not kind of performing...they are not getting the improvement in tandem with the moderating levels of pricing... that is likely going to be a headwind for them over the near term,\" Wedbush analyst Gerald Pascarelli said.\n\nThe soda and snacks giant's forecast annual organic revenue growth of at least 4%, compared to the 9.5% growth reported for fiscal 2023.\n\n\"Category growth rates are normalizing as consumer behaviors largely revert to pre-pandemic norms and net revenue realization moderates as inflationary pressures are expected to abate,\" CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.\n\nStill, PepsiCo beat fourth-quarter profit expectations and forecast annual core profit slightly above estimates, betting on easing input and freight costs.\n\nPepsiCo expects fiscal 2024 core earnings per share of $8.15, compared with expectations of $8.14 and announced a 7% increase to its annual dividend.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.78 per share, beating estimates of $1.72.\n\n(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "title": "Coca-Cola is making a play for Gen Z with spicy soda. Here\u2019s a look back at past bizarre flavors, including its apathetic bid for Gen X",
        "content": "Coca-Cola thinks it knows the way to Gen Z\u2019s heart: via its spice receptors.\n\nThe Atlanta beverage giant has just rolled out Coca-Cola Spiced, a raspberry and spice flavored soda, as part of its permanent lineup, the company announced Wednesday. The product\u2014also in Coke Zero Sugar form\u2014will hit shelves in the U.S. and Canada on Feb. 19.\n\n\u201cIf you go to the aisles, you\u2019ll see the amount of spiciness has gone up because consumers\u2019 taste palates have evolved. We realized that could be an opportunity for us,\u201d Coca-Cola\u2019s North American marketing chief, Shakir Moin, told the AP.\n\nAlong with its spicy Coke, Coca-Cola is hoping to attract Gen Z customers with another new entry: Happy Tears Zero Sugar, a mystery-flavored, salt- and mineral-infused product that comes with a \u201chype kit\u201d of stickers and apparel available only on TikTok until Feb. 17.\n\n\u201cGen Z is super important to us as a brand, as they are the next generation of tasters,\u201d Sue Lynne Cha, Coca-Cola\u2019s VP of marketing for North America, said in a statement to Fortune.\n\nCoca-Cola is wooing Gen Z, a more health-conscious generation drawn to soft drinks trumpeting health benefits (amid reports of Diet Coke\u2019s sweetener being linked to cancer), particularly as its eternal rivalry with PepsiCo heats up yet again. Analysts have foreseen that PepsiCo could soon retake the title of highest-valued beverage company, though Coca-Cola is expected to have solid fourth-quarter earnings. Units sold by PepsiCo\u2019s beverage businesses were down 7% in December, while Coca-Cola\u2019s rose 3%, according to YipitData.\n\nLast January, PepsiCo launched its own Gen Z\u2013friendly soda, Starry, which achieved a half-billion dollars in sales in its first year, more than forerunner Sierra Mist made in the past four years combined. Starry will debut its first Super Bowl commercial on Sunday with 24-year-old rapper Ice Spice.\n\nCoca-Cola is leaning hard into appealing to Gen Z audiences now, but it has long tried to connect with the youth of yesteryear, sometimes with success, and sometimes appearing to try a bit hard to fit in.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s history of wining and dining a tough young crowd\n\nThirty years ago, Gen X was Coca-Cola\u2019s \u201cnext generation of tasters.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the failed \u201cNew Coke,\u201d a 1985 reformulation of the classic cola that has gone down as a historic corporate fiasco, Coca-Cola doubled down on strange concepts from the mind of Sergio Zyman, the executive in charge of New Coke.\n\nZyman\u2019s next brainchild was OK Soda, launched in 1993 as a way to give the supposedly apathetic and cynical generation of Xers some vague optimism. Coca-Cola, attempting to re-create the irony embraced by the generation, set up a hotline for people to leave reviews of the soda and aired nihilistic ads: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of OK? What\u2019s the point of anything?\u201d\n\nThis was a generation, after all, that contributed a historic rock anthem named ironically after the short-lived deodorant brand Teen Spirit.\n\nThe soda\u2019s taste was, well, just okay. One consumer likened it to \u201ccarbonated tree sap.\u201d The company sold just 1 million cases, and OK was pulled from the shelves by fall 1995.\n\nCoca-Cola has embraced the absurd since then: Japan\u2019s green-tea-flavored Coke debuted in 2009, and garlic-flavored Coke launched in 2022. In 2006, Coca-Cola Blak, a combination of cola and coffee, made a short-lived appearance before being pulled in 2008. Coca-Cola launched another coffee-infused product in 2019. Two years ago, Coca-Cola pulled its energy drink after an underwhelming one year in stores.\n\nBut Coca-Cola learned from its mistakes when making generation-targeted products. After yearslong dips in Diet Coke sales, Coca-Cola rebranded the product in slim cans, with flavors such as Feisty Cherry and Twisted Mango to appeal to millennials, who then preferred fruit-flavored seltzers like La Croix. After Coca-Cola released the new Diet Coke products in 2018, it reported a \u201creturn to growth\u201d for the product.\n\nIn 2022, the company launched Coca-Cola Creations, a line of limited flavors and brand collaborations agreeable to Gen Z and their love of good vibes. Coca-Cola Starlight, launched in February that year, had packaging meant to evoke a \u201cnebular feel.\u201d In June, the company launched Coca-Cola Marshmello, a strawberry and watermelon flavored drink, in collaboration with popular music producer DJ Marshmello. Y3000, a zero-sugar flavor developed with AI, joined its Creations line in September. Happy Tears is the line\u2019s newest addition.\n\nCoca-Cola Consolidated\u2019s 2022 annual report suggested the Creations line has been a success, and was credited for the sparkling category\u2019s \u201csolid operating results.\u201d With the brand\u2019s recent success among younger audiences, it can have hope that the new spicy Coke will keep its bite.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Bull runs turn many patient investors into wealthy ones. These stampedes bring stock prices higher and reward people who take on a buy-and-hold approach.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to time the market and analyze the stock market every day. Buying and holding reliable growth stocks can lead to more returns without as much effort. While the Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t committed to lowering interest rates in March, interest rates are likely to go down in 2024. That catalyst and other can trigger a new bull run, and these stocks stand to benefit.\n\nPerion (PERI) peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nPerion (NASDAQ:PERI) is a $1.5 billion advertising company that has delivered a 5-year gain above 800% for its investors. The company has tapped into several high-growth advertising channels. The company has no debt and recently put its extra capital to use with a $100 million acquisition of Hivestack. The acquired firm specializes in digital out-of-home advertising and has several corporations as its partners.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPerion isn\u2019t only growing via partnerships. The company recently announced a partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for its Vidazoo Platform. This partnership allows Perion\u2019s advertisers to tap into Amazon Publisher Services and can lead to \u201ca significant volume of premium demand from leading advertisers.\u201d The partnership will help Perion work with leading publishers and connect them with premium advertisers.\n\nPerion trades at a 10 forward P/E ratio and has a 0.46 PEG ratio. A major catalyst is the likely contract extension between Perion and Bing later in the year. This partnership represents roughly 45% of Perion\u2019s total revenue and has been a boon for Perion and Bing.\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany businesses rely on the internet to reach new customers and generate revenue. However, the digital world has many intrusion points that hackers can exploit. More companies are turning to Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) to keep their websites up and running.\n\nStory continues\n\nCloudflare is a cloud services provider and offers an enterprise-grade content delivery network. This dynamic results in faster load times, lower costs, and better protection against hackers.\n\nCloudflare\u2019s services continue to experience heightened demand. The company grew revenue by 32% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023. The firm narrowed its GAAP net losses from $42.5 million in losses to $23.5 million in losses.\n\nThe stock can get more enticing as Cloudflare gets closer to profitability, but investors have already been loading up on shares. The equity is up by 57% over the past year and has gained 361% over the past five years.\n\nCloudflare innovated and accelerated its efforts in artificial intelligence to strengthen its product offerings. This development can increase retention rates and lead to higher subscription costs in the future.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) achieved double-digit revenue growth rates across its two key verticals: advertising and the cloud. Revenue in the Google advertising segment was up by 11.0% year-over-year while Google Cloud revenue jumped by 25.7% year-over-year.\n\nThose segments and Alphabet\u2019s other verticals resulted in 13% year-over-year revenue growth for the company as a whole in Q4 2023. Alphabet\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d segment almost tripled year-over-year, and comments from Alphabet\u2019s CFO Ruth Porat suggest that those investments will continue.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to our work to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth opportunities,\u201d Porat stated in the press release.\n\nAlphabet achieved revenue and earnings growth while reducing its employee count by almost 8,000. The company let go roughly 4% of its workforce in 2023. Google Cloud once again delivered high profits while the company\u2019s \u201cOther Bets\u201d segment delivers a relatively small net loss. Alphabet managed to narrow losses across this division.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a customer relationship management platform that helps businesses grow. The company has over 194,000 customers in 120 countries and has a range of affordable and high-end plans.\n\nThe tech software firm increased revenue by 26% year-over-year in Q3 2023 and significantly narrowed its net losses. The company looks like it is on the verge of profitability and should scale up its profit margins quickly.\n\nThis development would help the stock tremendously, but it has already been on an incredible run. Shares are up by 68% over the past year and have gained 270% over the past five years. HubSpot is charging closer to the all-time high it set in 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s customer base grew by 225% year-over-year which indicates solid demand for the platform. HubSpot is making money by raising its prices and getting customers to upgrade their plans. However, the ability to still attract new customers at this high rate points to more gains.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has outperformed the S&P 500 over several years. The index\u2019s 79% gain over the past five years falls well below the beauty firm\u2019s 1,790% gain during the same period. Elf Beauty has robust revenue and net income growth that suggest it can continue to outperform the index.\n\nHowever, there is another catalyst for this stock that investors may be overlooking. Elf Beauty currently has a market cap just shy of $9 billion. This high growth stock is getting closer to the critical $12.7 billion market cap threshold.\n\nWhy is this number important? A company must exceed $12.7 billion in market cap to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Elf Beauty fulfills the other key requirements and can get added to the index in the future. The equity has to rally by close to 50% from current levels to be within the range of S&P 500 inclusion.\n\nGetting added to the index can help shares reach all-time highs as fund managers have to load up on the stock. However, the company is already doing just fine with 76% year-over-year revenue growth and 184% year-over-year net income growth in Q2 FY24.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Hand pointing upward next to upward trend stock chart in purple and blackish blue lighting, symbolizes growth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) shares soared to an all-time high after the firm reported earnings. While the stock quickly lost some ground, it indicates plenty of excitement for the stock.\n\nThat excitement can continue to build as other artificial intelligence leaders report earnings. Supermicro also seems poised to beat its guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 based on the rapid acceleration in business during the previous quarter.\n\nRevenue more than doubled year-over-year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 while net income increased by 68.2% year-over-year. CEO Charles Liang expressed optimism that the company is generating more demand.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to win new partners, our current end customers continue to demand more Supermicro\u2019s optimized AI computer platforms and rack-scale Total IT Solutions,\u201d he stated.\n\nSupermicro offers great potential as it is, but an S&P 500 inclusion can help shares soar higher. Supermicro meets the standards for S&P 500 inclusion. The company has a market cap over $12.7 billion and reported positive earnings in the most recent quarter and year.\n\nInstitutional investors will be forced to buy more shares for funds that track the S&P 500. This development will reward investors who accumulate SMCI stock before the inclusion.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a small sports beverage company that is quickly becoming mainstream. The equity has a $12 billion market cap and has gained more than 3,700% over the past five years.\n\nThe stock trades at a lofty 45 forward P/E ratio but has many growth catalysts that suggest a premium valuation is warranted. The firm grew its net income by 146% year-over-year in a record-breaking quarter. Revenue growth came in at 104% year-over-year.\n\nCelsius Holdings enjoys an elevated 21.8% net profit margin and hasn\u2019t even cracked into the international markets yet. The sports beverage company is just getting started on this venture as a partnership with Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) makes it more feasible.\n\nBuilding an international presence can help Celsius Holdings maintain triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters or even multiple years. The growth engine can continue to reward investors who set lengthy time horizons for their positions.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in PERI, NET, ELF, SMCI, and CELH.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US. If you want to skip our comprehensive analysis of the car insurance market in the US, you can go directly to 5 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US.\n\nCar insurance operates as a mutual agreement between you and an insurance company. In this arrangement, you commit to paying premiums, and in return, the insurance company protects against financial losses resulting from accidents or damage to your vehicle. By paying a premium, you secure an agreement with the insurance company, and they commit to covering your losses as specified in your policy. These policies are tailored to individual needs and budgets, allowing you to customize coverage amounts accordingly. Typically, policy terms span six or twelve months and are renewable. The insurance provider will inform you when it's time to renew your policy and submit another premium payment.\n\nIn most US states, it's a legal requirement to have car insurance. If you cause a car accident, the auto liability coverage mandated by your insurance helps cover certain expenses. This includes the other party's medical bills and the repair or replacement of their vehicle or property damaged in the accident. Additionally, this coverage assists in paying for your legal fees if you end up in court due to the accident.\n\nThe Benefits of Getting Car Insurance\n\nMany drivers get car insurance because it's a legal requirement, but it's not just about meeting the minimum coverage. There are several reasons to consider having car insurance. It serves as a financial safeguard for you and your family, preventing significant expenses. By investing a modest amount now, you can avoid hefty costs in the future. Quality car insurance provides protection for you, your family, passengers, and other drivers. In the event of an accident, having the right coverage ensures that you're financially prepared for property damage or bodily injury expenses. Dealing with the aftermath of a car accident can be time-consuming and tiresome. With proper coverage, you can sidestep the hassle of negotiating with other parties involved, managing repair or replacement costs for your vehicle, and handling various headaches that may arise. A comprehensive auto insurance policy not only assists with towing, repairs, and replacements for your vehicle but also covers damages to other drivers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSurge in Car Insurance Rates\n\nThis year, auto insurance rates have seen another increase, and an expert attributes it to a combination of factors, including the higher costs of cars and parts, as well as a growing number of accidents. Scott Holeman, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, appeared in an interview on 25News where he pointed out that insurance companies incur higher expenses not only in repairing vehicles but also in dealing with legal actions arising from car accidents. Speaking on the matter, Holeman stated, \u201cThat litigation has a direct impact on insurance premiums. There are these high-dollar rewards in court cases. That\u2019s going to be passed along to consumers.\u201d He also highlighted that the prevalence of more technologically advanced cars on the roads is contributing to the overall increase in insurance prices. According to Holeman, insurance companies are incurring $1.12 in expenses for every $1 of premium written, essentially paying out more than they are taking in. He noted that the persistently high rates of accidents will likely keep insurance rates elevated in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccording to auto insurance processing company CCC Intelligent Solutions, the average repair cost for a traditional vehicle currently stands at $4,437. For electric vehicles, the average repair expense is 49% higher at $6,618. This increase is attributed to the additional technological components in electric vehicles and the specialized handling required for their electric powertrains. Insurers have responded to the surge in repair costs, witnessing a 64% rise in the average collision insurance claim from 2018 to 2022, reaching $5,992 according to the Insurance Information Institute. To counteract the escalating repair expenses, insurance providers have significantly increased drivers' premiums. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that the cost of auto insurance in the United States experienced a notable increase of over 20% in 2023, marking the most substantial annual surge since 1976.\n\nTop Companies Shaping the US Car Insurance Market\n\nIn the realm of US motor insurance, standout players include The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR), Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL).

The Progressive Corporation, in its latest earnings report on January 24, 2024, exceeded expectations with an EPS Normalized Actual of $2.97, surpassing estimates by $0.55. Additionally, the EPS GAAP Actual stood at $3.37, surpassing predictions by $0.79, and the company reported a revenue of $15.13 billion.\n\nTravelers Companies Inc. (NYSE:TRV) had a strong finish to the fourth quarter of 2023, especially in the property casualty insurance sector. Travelers Companies Inc. (NYSE:TRV) reported a net income of $1.626 billion.

For the entire fourth quarter, the pre-tax total for catastrophe losses was $68 million.\n\nLet's now take a look at the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US. 15 States with the Cheapest Car Insurance In The US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThis article provides a compilation of the 15 states with the cheapest car insurance in the US.

Its complementary brands/businesses include Frito-Lay snacks, Pepsi-Cola beverages, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices and Quaker foods.

Looking at trading volume, an average of 4,850,138 shares exchanged hands over the last 20 trading days.\n\nMomentum investors also pay close attention to a company's earnings. For PEP, one analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $7.55 per share for 2023. PEP boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.6%.\n\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding PEP to their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Betcha can't believe he's back. The Lay's brand has rekindled their iconic partnership with NHL legend Mark Messier.\n\nTORONTO, Feb. 8, 2024 /CNW/ - Today, Canada's favourite potato chip brand - Lay's, announced the rekindling of an iconic partnership with NHL legend Mark Messier. For the first time in more than 10 years, Canadians will see Mark back as the face of the brand featured in the latest ad campaign 'Betcha Can't Pick Just One,' launching during Sunday's Big Game. Betcha can\u2019t believe he\u2019s back. The Lay\u2019s brand has rekindled their iconic partnership with NHL legend Mark Messier. (CNW Group/PepsiCo Foods Canada)\n\nThis new campaign spot dubbed the \"Casting Call,\"\u00a0takes on a unique closed social experiment, showcasing two brand truths: how delicious Lay's flavours are and how difficult it is to pick just one flavour. Developed with award-winning creative producer, Jordan Cohen, and renowned director, Hank Perlman, \"Casting Call\" features a fictional audition set up, where one by one aspiring actors are unknowingly put to the test. With the idea of \"winning\" one million dollars on the line, will they be able to only pick one flavour?\n\n\"Betcha can't name a more recognizable duo than Lay's potato chips and Mark Messier,\" said Jess Spaulding, Chief Marketing Officer of PepsiCo Foods Canada. \"People often ask me what my favourite Lay's flavour is and I honestly can't pick just one. We know this is true for many Lay's fans and we brought Mark back for another iconic 'Betcha' campaign to test this theory.\"\n\n\"It's great to be back collaborating with Lay's,\" said 15x all-star and 6-time Stanley Cup winner Mark Messier. \"A lot of time may have passed but one thing that hasn't changed is my love of Lay's chips. It's been amazing to bring this 'Betcha Can't Pick Just One' campaign to life.\"\n\nBut Mark isn't the only icon making a big return. The Lay's brand is turning up the heat with the permanent launch of Sweet Chili Heat! flavoured potato chips. Originally launched as a limited-edition flavour in 2021, Lay's Sweet Chili Heat! became a quick favourite. The flavour is back permanently and just in time to be added to Big Game snack line-ups.\n\nStory continues\n\nYou can watch the new Lay's campaign: HERE\n\nEach participant who partook in the social experiment will receive free Lay's chips for a year.\n\nShare your Big Game moments with Lay's Sweet Chili Heat! flavoured potato chips using the hashtag #BetchaCant.\n\nAbout Lay's Canada\n\nLay's potato chips are Canada's favourite potato chip brand and one of PepsiCo Canada's flagship brands.

        "title": "Buy PepsiCo Stock Ahead of Earnings and Hold Forever?",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) stock is down 12% from its May peaks heading into its Q4 earnings release on Friday, February 9.\n\nThe stock has crushed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and rival Coca-Cola (KO) over the last decade. Plus, its dividend yield is solid and its valuation levels are intriguing.\n\nThe Basic Bull Case\n\nPepsiCo\u2019s brands include Gatorade, Tostitos, Pepsi, Bubly, and much more. Pepsi has posted impressive growth over the last several years as it successfully navigates new dietary habits and ongoing challenges from upstarts and its core rival Coca-Cola. PEP shares went on a strong run off the Covid lows and got off to a hot start in 2023.\n\nThe stock then dropped as more investors grew nervous about the growing use of weight loss drugs and the possible negative near-term and long-term impact they might have on PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and tons of other consumer staples brands, as well as the likes of McDonald\u2019s (MCD). PepsiCo also got caught up in wider selling across consumer staples because higher interest rates made their dividends less impressive. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInterest rates have already peaked and the Fed is poised to start cutting rates at some point in 2024, making PepsiCo\u2019s 2.9% dividend yield, which blows away SPY\u2019s 1.3% and matches KO\u2019s 3.0%, more attractive sooner than later. Plus, PepsiCo\u2019s results and outlook showcase that despite the success of weight loss drugs and some changing consumer habits, soda and snacks remain a booming business.\n\nPEP\u2019s sales are projected to jump 7% in FY23 and over 4% in FY24 to climb from $86.39 billion last year to $96.05 billion in 2024. PepsiCo\u2019s expected expansion follows 9% sales growth last year and 13% higher revenue in FY21. Meanwhile, its adjusted EPS are projected to climb by over 11% this year and then pop 7.4% higher in FY24.\n\nOther Fundamentals\n\nPEP\u2019s stagnant earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). But the company has topped our quarterly EPS estimates for five years running.\n\nStory continues\n\nPepsiCo shares have climbed 115% over the last 10 years vs. the Zacks Consumer Staples sector\u2019s 21% and Coca-Cola\u2019s 60%. Expanding our view to 20 years, PEP has climbed by 230% vs. Coca-Cola\u2019s 140% and its sector\u2019s 71%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPEP has popped 22% in the last three years, but it is now trading around where it was this time last year. The stock is down 12% from its peaks and trading 11% below its average Zacks price target. The stock has climbed 9% since mid-October after it found support at its 200-week moving average.\n\nPepsiCo is back above its 50-day moving average and floating around neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. Valuation-wise PepsiCo trades at a 22% discount to its highs at 20.9X forward earnings and slightly below its 10-year median and KO despite its outperformance.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBuying stocks right before earnings strictly to try to cash in on a big bounce is a risky proposition. Long-term investors, on the other hand, might want to consider buying and holding PepsiCo stock for many of the reasons touched on here, coupled with the fact that it has rarely traded below its 50-week moving average for very long over the past decade like it is right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) Reports Q4: Everything You Need To Know Ahead Of Earnings\n\nFood and beverage company PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) will be announcing earnings results tomorrow before market open. Here's what you need to know.\n\nLast quarter PepsiCo reported revenues of $23.45 billion, up 6.7% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a strong quarter for the company, with optimistic earnings guidance for the full year.\n\nIs PepsiCo buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter analysts are expecting PepsiCo's revenue to grow 1.3% year on year to $28.37 billion, slowing down from the 10.9% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $1.72 per share. PepsiCo Total Revenue\n\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bearish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing five downward revisions over the last thirty days.\u00a0The company has a history of exceeding Wall St's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years on average by 3.5%.\n\nLooking at PepsiCo's peers in the consumer staples segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Constellation Brands delivered top-line growth of 1.4% year on year, missing analyst estimates by 2.6% and BellRing Brands reported revenues up 18.7% year on year, exceeding estimates by 5.4%. Both stocks (Constellation Brands and BellRing Brands) traded flat on the results.\n\nRead our full analysis of Constellation Brands's results here and BellRing Brands's results here.\n\nInvestors in the consumer staples segment have had steady hands going into the earnings, with the stocks down on average 1.5% over the last month. PepsiCo is up 2.7% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $187.3, compared to share price of $171.5.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.

        "title": "Celsius Stock (NASDAQ:CELH): How Promising Is Its International Expansion?",
        "content": "Many companies are seeking international expansion as a way to generate higher revenue and earnings growth. For instance,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0(NYSE:WMT) posted higher\u00a0international revenue growth\u00a0than\u00a0domestic revenue growth.\u00a0Celsius Holdings\u00a0(NASDAQ:CELH), a sports beverage company now entering international markets for the first time through a partnership with\u00a0Pepsi\u00a0(NASDAQ:PEP), has a lot to gain.\n\nCELH is slowly penetrating international markets, which can help the stock march higher, making me bullish. Investors are feeling optimistic about the company\u2019s chances and aren\u2019t afraid to pay a premium. Shares currently trade at a forward P/E ratio of 46.5. It\u2019s time to examine why bullish investors believe Celsius Holdings is worth the premium and how international expansion can impact its total sales.\n\nWhy Are Celsius Beverages Different?\n\nCelsius\u2019 stock price has skyrocketed by about 4,000% over the past five years. The company has been doing several things right to warrant that type of increase. The\u00a0average CELH stock price target of $71.69 from 13 analysts even implies 28.5% upside from current levels.\n\nThe company offers a tasty sports beverage drink that is healthier than most of the competition. The drink has sparkling and non-carbonated flavors, is non-GMO, and does not contain high fructose corn syrup, a common ingredient in most sports beverages. The drink is also free of added sodium, soy, gluten, and sugar. Celsius drinks consist of seven essential vitamins.\n\nThis combination of health benefits helped Celsius Holdings\u00a0increase its revenue by 104% year-over-year\u00a0in the third quarter of 2023. The company recently became profitable and delivered 137.8% year-over-year net income growth in the same quarter.\n\nHow Much Can International Expansion Help?\n\nInternational expansion will help any company. Offering products and services outside of the United States allows companies to reach more potential customers. However, it can have a tremendous impact on Celsius Holdings. Some companies prioritize international markets when their domestic growth rates decelerate. However, Celsius is still achieving meaningful revenue growth in North America.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note how much of the company\u2019s revenue comes from the continent. Out of the company\u2019s $385 million in total revenue, $371 million came from North America. That\u2019s 96.4% of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nMany bullish investors have compared Celsius Holdings to\u00a0Monster Beverage\u00a0(NASDAQ:MNST). For context, Monster has a market cap that\u2019s almost five times higher than Celsius Holdings\u2019 market cap.\n\nMonster Beverage has been\u00a0gaining market share\u00a0in many international regions. Higher market share translated into 20.2% year-over-year International revenue growth in\u00a0Q3 2023. The company generated $733.7 million in International revenue, which represents close to 40% of total net sales.\n\nTotal revenue was $1.86 billion, which was up by 14.3% year-over-year. Without the International segment, Monster Beverage only generated $1.13 billion in Q3 revenue.\n\nFor every dollar Monster makes in the U.S., it makes roughly $0.65 in International sales. Giving Celsius Holdings that ratio can lead to substantially higher revenue.\n\nWith a 1.65 multiplier from a large international presence, Celsius Holdings\u2019 Q3-2023 revenue would have jumped from $385 million to $612.2 million. I am using the $371 million in North American revenue as the multiplier ($371 million x 1.65 = $612.2 million).\n\nThis new revenue figure represents a 225.3% year-over-year increase compared to $188.2 million in Q3-2022 revenue. Assuming the net profit margin of 21.82% remains the same, profits would have been $133.6 million instead of $84.0 million for Q3 2023.\n\nCelsius isn\u2019t likely to generate roughly 40% of its revenue from international markets anytime soon. However, long-term investors can wait patiently for the company to get closer to that percentage.\n\nIf Celsius Holdings has the same international reception as it did in the U.S., investors may enjoy triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth in those markets for a few years. It\u2019s this possibility, combined with a dominant domestic performance, that has this stock trading at a high valuation.\n\nIs CELH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, CELH stock comes in as a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. As stated earlier, analysts project 28.5% upside in Celsius stock, but the highest price target of $83.33 suggests even more optimism. This price target suggests 49% upside from the current price. Even the lowest price target of $64 per share implies a 14.7% gain.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Celsius Holdings Stock\n\nCelsius Holdings has delivered exceptional growth for investors as its sports beverages gain market share in the United States. While growth remains strong, leadership has not yet tapped into the company\u2019s full potential.\n\nA meaningful international expansion can fuel higher revenue growth for several years. It\u2019s possible for Celsius Holdings to catch up to Monster Beverage\u2019s market cap, and the company has a high-demand product that has the potential to become a big hit in other markets.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Coca-Cola (KO) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Coca-Cola (KO) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $10.63 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?\n\nFor Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.70%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination indicates that Coke will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +7.25%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nCoke appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nAnother stock from the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, PepsiCo (PEP), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $28.24 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for PepsiCo has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.41%.\n\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PepsiCo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street analysts forecast that PepsiCo (PEP) will report quarterly earnings of $1.72 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year increase of 3%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $28.24 billion, exhibiting an increase of 0.9% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, there has been no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\n\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\n\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some PepsiCo metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\n\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' reaching $1.53 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America' to reach $7.79 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net revenue- Quaker Foods North America' will likely reach $1.02 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -3.9% year over year.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net revenue- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' should come in at $1.89 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net revenue- PepsiCo Beverages North America' of $7.86 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -3% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net revenue- Europe' will reach $4.31 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +1.3% year over year.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net revenue- Latin America' will reach $3.85 billion. The estimate points to a change of +14.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Frito-Lay North America' to come in at $1.94 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $1.93 billion.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Latin America' should arrive at $553.89 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $424 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' at $125.67 million.

        "content": "Win or lose, at home or not \u2013 more than one-third of Americans also admit they'll likely miss work on Monday\n\nPLANO, Texas, Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The first-ever Super Bowl in Las Vegas will be among the year's most exciting cultural moments \u2013 but for a staggering 81% of Americans, watching it all from the couch is much better.\u00a0Frito-Lay's annual Super Bowl Snack Index today reveals an uptick in symptoms of #JOMO (Joy of Missing Out), as nearly half of Americans also admit they will prioritize watching the game surrounded by their favorite foods over large social gatherings with friends. From pregame party prep to the postgame pout, Frito-Lay\u2019s Super Bowl Snack Index is back with the most important Super Bowl party and food insights.\n\n\"The Super Bowl is a cultural phenomenon that we look forward to being an integral part of each year,\" said Denise Lefebvre, senior vice president of R&D for PepsiCo Foods. \"Whether Americans choose to enjoy it with a quiet evening or at a large social gathering, it's clear that culinary creations will rule the day. At Frito-Lay, we are dedicated to understanding our consumers' evolving food preferences and behaviors to ensure they have the options they want and every meal occasion is joyful.\"\n\nFrom pregame party prep to the postgame pout, Frito-Lay's Super Bowl Snack Index is back with the most important Super Bowl party and food insights.\n\nThe Pregame Party Playbook As #JOMO takes hold, the stakes have never been higher for Super Bowl party hosts. Athletes will tell you that preparation is key and Frito-Lay recommends calling three game-winning plays to guarantee celebrations are a touchdown:\n\nPlay #1 \u2013 Draft Your Dream Team:\n\nAs 3 in 5 guests admit the promise of top-notch food is the deciding factor in what Super Bowl party they attend, it's clear that the food and snack table will rule the day. This is particularly true among the under-40 crowd (77%) and parents (74%).  Potlucks prevail as the preferred party format at 67%, highlighting the popularity of collaborative celebrations over host-provided fare.  Play #2 \u2013 Tackle Your Party Menu:\n\nTake note that 70% of experienced hosts will gear up for the game by planning a menu for their guests. More than half (51%) will kick off their game day preparations at least a week in advance.  This is not the time to cut corners, especially when shopping for food essentials. Running out of food is considered the ultimate party foul by 1 in 3 guests, who cite it as worse than people blocking the TV, talking through the game and talking through the commercials.  Play #3 \u2013 Execute in the End Zone:\n\nThe comfier the couch, the better. An overwhelming 81% would rather watch the Super Bowl from cozy confines than at a raucous party in Vegas. Parents (27%), however, are more likely than non-parents (15%) to want a night out on The Vegas Strip.  And here's the ultimate game-changer: nearly half of Americans (46%) would rather celebrate surrounded by delicious food than their friends, making this year's spread more important than ever for\u00a0combatting guests' #JOMO.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnacks at the Snap\n\nThe Dip Dynasty: Dive into the timeless tradition of chips and dip, where Salsa (27%), French Onion (21%), and Queso (20%) reign supreme as the top three rival dips. While Salsa steals the spotlight among Gen Z, Millennials, and Gen X dippers, Baby Boomers crown French Onion as their dip MVP.  BBQ Wins the Battle: Fire up the grill and unleash the flavor with eccentric snack and food combos that showcase the art of culinary creativity! 80% of Americans consider combining multiple snacks and food \"to create the perfect bite\" as an \"art form.\" Watch out for recipes that cross team lines \u2013 Kansas City's BBQ (63%) dominates San Francisco's fish tacos (37%) in a head-to-head matchup of famous foods from the teams' home states.  Snacks Moving to Center Plate: With a 35% increase in consumers integrating their favorite snack products into meals, snacks are taking center stage in a new way. Whether it's yearning for a specific snack (51%) or simply being too busy to cook (44%), Frito-Lay's 2024 Snack Index predictions reveal that snacks are the essential ingredients for easy, no-prep meals \u2013 including those brought to Super Bowl parties.\n\nThe Postgame Pout\n\nWorkday Woes: Whether their team clinches victory or suffers defeat, more than 1/3 of fans expect to call in sick the Monday after the big game. Men are leading the charge, with 40% inclined to skip work compared to 27% of women. Across generational lines, it's Gen Z (46%) and Millennials (40%) who are most likely to miss at least part of the workday.  The Cost of Victory: Victory might taste sweet, but it seems it also comes with a side of postgame recovery. Fans of the winning team are 56% more likely to take a celebratory sick day than their counterparts.\n\nCheck out FritoLay.com and FritoLay.com/Snack-Index for the latest and greatest trends, product information and news.\n\nSurvey Methodology This survey was conducted between January 19 and January 25, 2024, among a sample of 2,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+.

        "content": "February 2024 is now upon us, making it a great time to discover blue-chip stocks to generate stable, long term returns in the stock market. It is without question that market exuberance is present, as the Federal Reserve held rates steady at the FOMC meeting last week.\n\nThe market has continued to surge to new record highs, led by the mega cap technology sector. While earnings have been much greater than anticipated, FOMO should not be a driver of your long term investing decisions. There still exist blue-chip stocks that stand out as rock-solid choices with hidden value for your portfolio this month.\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the 3 best blue-chip stocks to grab in February 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPepsiCo (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is an American multinational food and beverage company headquartered in Harrison, New York. They\u2019re undoubtedly one of the most recognized brands in the world with an incredible track record returning cash to shareholders.\n\nPepsiCo is unique in that they cover both manufacturing and distribution of their wide array of products. Over the last decade, the company has diversified its product portfolio which has paid dividends for the company. Furthermore, their expansion into international markets continues to be a key revenue growth driver.\n\nStrength in Latin America continues to show promising signs as they promote cost-management initiatives. Supply chain bottlenecks are alleviating, and loosening financial conditions are bullish for increased spending in the CPG sector. PepsiCo expects 10% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth in FY23. With a demonstrated history of returning cash to shareholders, don\u2019t leave this dividend growth stock behind in February 2024.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) finished off a strong 2023 fiscal year driven by strong double-digit growth at Optum and UnitedHealth Care. They\u2019re one of the largest companies in the world by revenue, and ranked 10th on the 2023 Fortune Global 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnitedHealth Group is arguably one of the most impressive stories of the last decade. The stock has returned a 23.50% CAGR over the last decade, and is up 740% during the same time period. This shouldn\u2019t surprise investors, as the company has continued to deliver strong year-over-year (YOY) growth in revenue, operating income, and EPS.\n\nIn FY23, operating income increased 13.8% YOY to $32.4 billion as diversified growth lifted all boats. EPS hit a record $25.12 per share, as the company\u2019s strong execution allowed them to serve more customers. With the recent dip in the stock price, discerning investors will scoop up shares here for the long term.\n\nDeere & Co. (DE) Several John Deere vehicles are parked outside of a building.\n\nSource: Jim Lambert / Shutterstock.com\n\nDeere & Co. (NYSE:DE) stands out among the elite blue-chip stocks to buy for February 2024. Not only is the company incredibly cheap, they stand to benefit from the long term tailwinds of the Infrastructure Investments & Jobs Act.\n\nDeere & Co. has traded sideways for the last several years despite the significant progress the company has made. As one of the world\u2019s largest construction equipment manufacturers, they were inevitably impacted by supply chain constraints and higher interest rates. However, they were able to weather the storm and still deliver significant top and bottom line growth in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nIn FY23, Deere grew its top line revenue 16.5% YOY to $61.25 billion. Net income skyrocketed 42% to $10.16 billion, or $34.63 per share. Deere has continued to grow its quarterly dividend at a high rate, most evident in its 9% hike to a record $1.47 per share. While earnings are forecasted to decline to mid-cycle levels in FY24, cheap blue-chip stocks leave a compelling opportunity for long term investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PepsiCo (PEP) Sees Brand Strength: Will Its Q4 Earnings Beat?",
        "content": "PepsiCo, Inc. PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2023 numbers on Feb 9, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $28.2 billion, implying 0.9% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.\r\n\r\nFor quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.72, suggesting 3% growth from the $1.67 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nIn the last reported quarter, the company registered an earnings beat of 3.7%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 5.6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nPepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. Quote\n\nKey Factors to Note\n\nPepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nPEP\u2019s fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.\r\n\r\nWe expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 6.2% for the fourth quarter, driven by a 9.6% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 3.5% decline in volume.\r\n\r\nMarket share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay\u2019s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.\r\n\r\nHowever, PepsiCo\u2019s fourth-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.\r\n\r\nIncreased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 30 bps to 52.8% in the fourth quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&A expenses of $11.9 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 1.1%. Driven by the gross margin expansion and higher SG&A expenses, our model suggests a 10-bps operating margin expansion to 10.6% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Model\n\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nPepsiCo has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.41%.\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola KO currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.70% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2023 numbers.

        "content": "This unexpected dream team stars alongside Jenna Ortega and Danny Ramirez in an action-packed campaign\n\nPLANO, Texas, Feb. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Released today, the first-ever Doritos Dinamita Super Bowl commercial blows away expectations by introducing fans to Dina and Mita, a feisty duo of unlikely heroes whose love for the perfectly spicy, flavorful heat of Doritos Dinamita propels them through any obstacle that stands between them and their new favorite snack.\n\n\"I know everyone is going to love Dina and Mita just as much as I do. Their fire and spice were delivered so authentically in the commercial, thanks to the talented, diverse cast and crew,\" said star Jenna Ortega. \"It means so much to me to not only star alongside Dina and Mita, but to collaborate with the whole team to bring the story of Dinamita's explosive flavors to life and to connect with Latin and Hispanic cultures.\"\n\nIn the commercial, airing during the third quarter of Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11, Ortega, Dina and Mita search for their favorite Dinamita chips when actor Danny Ramirez snatches up the last bag for himself. Since nothing will stop Dina and Mita from getting their hands on Doritos Dinamita snacks, the feisty pair leaves Ortega in the dust as they begin an explosive pursuit.\n\n\"I wasn't expecting Dina and Mita to be so committed to getting their hands on Doritos Dinamita. The flavor they brought to the chase was amazing,\" said Ramirez. \"While it was a blast to play the antagonist in this story, I will be holding on to my Doritos Dinamita a little tighter from now on.\"\n\n\"Doritos has built a legacy over the past 24 years with Super Bowl campaigns that feature the highest caliber of talent and innovation, but you've never seen us like this before,\" said Brett O'Brien, chief marketing officer at PepsiCo Foods North America. \"We're not only bringing the entertainment to fans this year by introducing Dinamita during one of the biggest cultural moments of the year, we're talking directly to consumers who are on the lookout for something new, different and packed with flavor.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nEncouraging fans to \"Go Ahead, Try Us,\" Doritos Dinamita is getting in front of intense flavor seekers all year leading up to Super Bowl LVIII.\u00a0From delivering a new spectrum of flavor and spice to retailers nationwide and building anticipation for their explosive in-game ad, to showing up in Las Vegas in style and reaching spice-lovers on social, Doritos Dinamita is bringing the heat:\n\nFor weeks, the brand dropped teaser images and videos (found here, here, here and here) fueling fan speculation about what Ortega and Ramirez may have up their sleeves and who else may join them on their mission.

        "content": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - Pepsi India bottler Varun Beverages reported a nearly 77% surge in its quarterly profit on Monday, as it saw double-digit volume growth across domestic and international markets even as higher costs of essentials weighed on consumers.\n\nConsolidated net profit rose to 1.32 billion rupees ($15.9 million) for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 747.5 million rupees in the year-ago period.\n\nConsumers in cities with higher average incomes, compared with their counterparts in the hinterlands, have helped makers of packaged goods pull in massive sales, even in the face of higher prices of essentials.\n\nThe Gurugram-based company, with operations across six countries, is one of PepsiCo's largest franchisee outside the United States, and packages and distributes beverages under Pepsi, Mirinda and Tropicana labels.\n\nVarun Beverages said in its investor presentation that it saw a 21% surge in its revenue from operations at 27.31 billion rupees in the reported period, and also an upbeat volume growth.\n\nThe cost of raw materials, which include flavored concentrate, packaging material and sugar, edged 1.8% higher during the quarter.\n\nVarun Beverages' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin expanded to 15.7% from 13.9% a year earlier, aided by softer packaging costs amid an uptick in sugar prices.\n\nLast year, the firm announced its foray into the South African markets with the acquisition of The Beverage Company, which analysts expect will aid the Indian bottler.\n\nAdditionally, Varun Beverages approved a final dividend of 1.25 rupees per share for the financial year ended Dec. 31.\n\nShares of the company, which rose more than 30% during the December quarter, were trading flat after the results.\n\nPepsico Inc is due to report quarterly results on Feb. 09.\n\n($1 = 83.0180 Indian rupees)\n\n(Reporting by Ashna Teresa Britto in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips)",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nStocks are back near record highs with the S&P 500 finishing Friday at 4,959, its highest close ever. All three major indexes logged gains for the week, surviving a tumultuous week of trading.\n\nStocks initially slid following lackluster tech results from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and sold off further on Wednesday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut in March is not the \"base case.\"\n\nBut blowout earnings from Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN), combined with a stronger-than-expected January jobs report, sent stocks into rally mode. morning brief image\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained just under 1%.\n\nA slew of corporate earnings including reports from Eli Lily (LLY), Disney (DIS), Spotify (SPOT), McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle (CMG), and Pepsi (PEP) will greet investors in the week ahead amid a light economic schedule.\n\nThe rate cut debate rolls on\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on investor hopes for a March interest rate cut during his press conference following the January Fed meeting. Powell said the central bank needs \"greater confidence\" in inflation's path lower before cutting rates.\n\nEconomists believe the January jobs report, which showed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in the month, bolsters the Fed's case it can wait to cut interest rates without pushing the economy into recession. But the report also brought forth concerns about inflation reaccelerating, as wages increased 4.6% in the month, the highest pace of growth since July 2023.\n\n\"After the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, we maintained confidence in our expectation of a March rate cut,\" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"After today's data, however, it is hard to see how that is going to happen. Barring a significant turnaround in the February data, or very weak inflation data between now and mid-March, it is much more likely that the FOMC will hold policy rates steady in March.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are now placing a roughly 20% chance on a interest rate cut at the March meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. On Thursday, there had been a nearly 40% chance and a month ago nearly an 80% chance.\n\nEarnings check-in\n\nCorporate earnings appeared to round a corner to end last week. After S&P 500 earnings had been posting a more than 1% decline for the quarter, a swath of earnings in the past week flipped the narrative headline with earnings beats from tech stalwarts Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, per FactSet.\n\nThe latest data from FactSet shows earnings are expected to grow 1.6% in the fourth quarter. And notably, estimates for the first quarter have been kept in check too. In the past month analysts have trimmed first quarter earnings estimates by 1.4%, less than the five-year average of a 2.1% cut.\n\n104 S&P 500 companies are slated to report earnings this week, per FactSet.\n\nMainly quiet on the economic front\n\nAfter an onslaught of economic data that's showed the US economy is off to a hot start to the first quarter, investors will have few data points to dissect in the week ahead.

        "title": "Dividend Royalty: 5 Fabulous Stocks to Buy Now for Decades of Passive Income",
        "content": "Most people love the idea of buying an outstanding stock and holding it forever -- one great decision that builds wealth for you for decades without any additional action needed. But the reality is that finding individual stocks capable of such hands-free maintenance is extremely hard.\n\nMy idea of a forever company would have to meet some important criteria. For example:\n\nIt sells products people buy frequently and without a second thought. A recession-proof business, meaning it thrives in good times and bad. Has a long history of growing profits and sharing them with investors.\n\nA group of stocks called Dividend Kings fit this mold. These companies have paid and raised dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. That means thriving despite recessions, wars, pandemics, and more.\n\nHere are five such companies with winning formulas, poised to continue paying growing dividends to you for the foreseeable future.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nIn a world of over 8 billion people, there's a good chance every person will try a Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) product at some point in their lifetime. Coke's offerings range from bottled water to fountain sodas like Coca-Cola and Sprite, to hundreds of brands and products sold worldwide. The company has grown from its flagship soda product in the late 1800s to a beverage conglomerate with an unmatched global distribution network that will continue to quench the world's thirst.\n\nCoca-Cola is a money-printing machine. It produces the concentrates for its products and outsources the bottling to keep the business slim. People constantly drink beverages, and Coca-Cola products are virtually everywhere. The result is a cash-flow-rich business that always performs.\n\nThe company's 76% dividend payout ratio is a little high but still leaves breathing room for future increases, which management has done for 61 consecutive years. Investors buying today can enjoy a 3% yield that should continue growing well into the future.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Procter & Gamble\n\nConsumers might tighten spending during tough times, but few people stop buying toilet paper, toothpaste, or diapers. That's how Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) has continued to grow for generations. The conglomerate owns dozens of brands, selling products worldwide to an estimated 5 billion worldwide consumers. Such a diverse product line of essential household goods is an excellent formula for long-term staying power.\n\nProcter & Gamble's product portfolio can produce value in multiple ways. The company can create or acquire a new brand, grow it, and ultimately choose to sell it or another asset to raise money. The company has also flexed its pricing power in the face of inflation.\n\nSustained success has fueled 67 straight annual dividend increases, and its 57% payout ratio leaves tons of room for more. The dividend yield is 2.4% today.\n\n3. PepsiCo\n\nFood and beverage giant PepsiCo(NASDAQ: PEP) might not quite have the beverage dominance that Coca-Cola does, although it's a clear runner-up. However, the company's salty snacks business gives it a growth engine that Coca-Cola can't copy.\n\nPepsiCo owns many household food brands, including Quaker and Frito-Lay (Doritos, Lay's, Ruffles, and Cheetos). That combination gives PepsiCo unique leverage in grocery stores, virtually ensuring that millions of people buy its products every time they stock their cupboards.\n\nSalty snacks have a unique, comforting appeal to many people, especially when they're stressed, making PepsiCo a very resilient business. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 51 years in a row. The payout ratio is high today at 94%, but investors should look for that to come down because PepsiCo is enjoying strong growth.\n\nThere is also a fortress-like balance sheet with $10 billion in cash and an investment-grade credit rating from Moody's for additional peace of mind.\n\n4. Lowe's\n\nResidential real estate is a pillar of America's economy, the American Dream, and the most significant purchase consumers will ever make. But homes require constant maintenance and upgrades, and there is seemingly an endless housing shortage.\n\nLowe's Companies(NYSE: LOW) is the country's second-largest home improvement retailer, selling materials, tools, appliances, and services online and at over 1,800 stores. Lowe's size means it can sell for less than most competitors, and the bulkiness of home goods has helped it resist disruption from e-commerce. In fact, Lowe's has leveraged its stores as fulfillment centers to make e-commerce an opportunity.\n\nThe company has paid and raised its dividend for 61 straight years. Management's policy to keep a conservative payout ratio (currently just 47%) makes it a dividend shareholders can feel confident will continue to grow and show up year after year. The stock yields 2% today.\n\n5. Colgate-Palmolive\n\nIt doesn't always take a complex or innovative business model to excel. Colgate-Palmolive(NYSE: CL) is a consumer goods company that sells various product brands, but it has made its name as the leading global toothpaste brand. That's a product consumers buy routinely and hardly think about because Colgate is such a well-known name. Colgate holds more than a 40% worldwide market share in toothpaste, meaning that billions of people use its products daily.\n\nColgate's steady and recurrent global sales make it a dividend superstar, with 60 years of dividend growth. Plus, the company's payout ratio is still very well managed at 57%, so investors can buy the stock at a 2.3% starting dividend yield and potentially enjoy annual increases for many years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "As we enter 2024, the market is fully valued with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) at high trailing earnings. Thus, identifying growth opportunities becomes increasingly compelling. Below, we will introduce three under-the-radar stocks in 2024 poised for mind-blowing growth.\n\nThese \u201crising stars\u201d are not your typical headline dominators like the Magnificent Seven stocks. Instead, they are companies that have been quietly and diligently building their foundations. They are innovating in their markets and have positioned themselves for secular growth.\n\nEach stock has created a unique blend of innovation in a specific market niche. As a result, they have outpaced the revenue growth of their respective sectors. Due to their outstanding growth, they are just beginning to gain recognition among investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are set to make significant strides in 2024 with exciting expansion initiatives in their pipeline. Below, we shed light on these three exceptional stocks. We highlight their journey thus far and why they stand out as candidates for remarkable growth in the upcoming year.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) Graphic of blue arrows against deep blue background headed upward\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), the energy drinks maker, has seen a tremendous rise from its humble beginnings. Gradually, it has gained a share and now is the third-largest energy drink seller in the U.S. Yet its surge has just begun, and more revenue awaits with international expansion.\n\nThe company is already expanding internationally to capitalize on the untapped market. On January 22, it announced an international expansion drive to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) will be its exclusive distributor in Canada. In the U.K., the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, Suntory Beverage & Food Great Britain and Ireland (OTCMKTS:STBFY) will be the distribution partners.\n\nIf Celsius ramps up its international expansion efforts further, it will easily surpass Wall Street\u2019s 38% revenue growth expectations. Today, international sales represent under 5% of total revenues, highlighting the tremendous opportunity for this energy drink maker.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Holding AG (ONON) A basketball player makes a slam dunk in a crowded arena.\n\nSource: Alex Kravtsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith its innovative products, On Holding AG (NYSE:ONON) is disrupting the running, training, and tennis footwear space. Despite its early success, it has plenty of untapped potential it can capitalize on.\n\nFirst, to boost sales, the company is raising brand awareness by focusing on athletes to market its premium brand image. Athletes like Helen Obiri \u2013 who won the Boston and New York City marathons wearing On\u2019s CloudTri 1 \u2013 have popularized the brand. Furthermore, the company is rolling out its retail store concepts to raise awareness about its brand.\n\nThe company also plans to expand through multichannel partners and add to its product assortment. It is expanding its geographic footprint with partners like DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS). On the product side, the company plans to launch training apparel for the gym, studio, and the outdoors.\n\nDuring the investor day in October 2023, management outlined a plan to double net sales in the next three years. Building on 2023\u2019s over 44% growth, management expects 26% annual growth over the next three years. This growth, plus an expansion of adjusted margins to over 18% by 2026, presents a compelling under-the-radar stocks 2024 story.\n\nAppFolio (APPF) Graphic of businessman running up mountain path toward red flag at peak with red arrow on path behind him\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/pichit\n\nAppFolio (NASDAQ:APPF) just had one of its best days on January 26. After a blowout quarter, the stock surged over 28%, breaking out to an all-time high. The fundamentals and solid guidance mean this stock could rocket higher.\n\nSo, what got the market excited about APPF stock? Q4 2023 earnings for this real estate and property management software platform were outstanding. Revenues grew 39% year-over-year to $172 million, bringing full-year revenues to $620 million, a 31% increase.\n\nCEO Shane Trigg highlighted the focus on profitable growth. \u201cI am pleased to announce a successful fourth quarter that caps off a year in which AppFolio increased the pace of innovation while prioritizing profitable growth,\u201d he noted.\n\nManagement also provided a rosy outlook for 2024, predicting revenues of $755 million to $765 million, at least 21% growth. They also expect non-GAAP operating margins to improve from 12.2% of revenue to between 21 and 23%.\n\nAppFolio is one of the best under-the-radar stocks 2024 to buy. It is building a leading platform for the real estate market. With impressive revenue growth and improving profitability, APPF stock will continue higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had long positions in CELH and ONON but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "PepsiCo (PEP) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this food and beverage company have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, indicating a change of +3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 points to a change of +11.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.11 indicates a change of +7.4% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $28.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.9%. The $92.2 billion and $96.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.7% and +4.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $23.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.97 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.32%. The EPS surprise was +3.69%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nPepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The collaboration with United Microelectronics to develop a 12-nanometer process platform targeting high-growth markets further strengthens Intel\u2019s foundry capabilities.\n\nFinally, the advanced packaging business, with three additional design wins in Q4 and a total deal value for IFS exceeding\u00a0$10 billion, suggests the attractiveness of Intel\u2019s offerings in the foundry space. T\n\nStory continues\n\nhe strategic move to open Fab 9 in New Mexico to support 3D advanced packaging manufacturing is in response to the growing demand in this segment. Hence, this is contributing to Intel\u2019s revenue and value growth potential.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo begin with, the growth of total transactions for Visa (NYSE:V) Direct by 20% (Q1 2024) is a key factor for value growth.\n\nThis shows the increasing adoption and utilization of Visa\u2019s money movement solutions. To the point, Visa Direct offers instantaneous, secure, and easy transactions, and the growth reflects its relevance among Visa\u2019s consumers.\n\nAdditionally, the growth of P2P cross-border transactions by over 65% year-over-year signifies Visa\u2019s lead in enabling global money movement.\n\nThis suggests the increasing demand for cross-border P2P transactions and Visa\u2019s edge in capturing a considerable market share, the growth highlights an increase in transaction volume. Also, it is indicative of Visa\u2019s efforts to enhance its cross-border payment solutions.\n\nFinally, these metrics suggest the company\u2019s focus on providing users with efficient cross-border money transfer services. Thus, this contributes to Visa\u2019s competitive edge in global payments processing.\n\nArcher Daniels Midland (ADM) Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campus\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nArcher Daniels Midland\u2019s (NYSE:ADM) strategic partnerships and initiatives boost the company\u2019s rapid value growth potential.\n\nThese initiatives include targets such as 4 million regenerative acres by 2025 and 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel production annually.\n\nThese targets suggest Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s moves on sustainable practices and renewable energy.\n\nThe partnerships with\u00a0major players like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), and Carlsberg (OTCMKTS:CABGY) may contribute to Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s growth momentum. Also, the collaborations with industry giants enhance Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s moat. Also, this creates opportunities for mutually beneficial maneuvers.\n\nPlanned recurring cost savings from automation are nearing $20 million annually by 2024, focusing on operational efficiency. Automation supports Archer Daniels Midland to streamline operations, reduce costs, and boost productivity.\n\nFinally, Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s trailing four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital of\u00a013.2% (Q3 2023) signifies the company\u2019s efficient use of capital to generate profits.\n\nTherefore, a high ROIC indicates that Archer Daniels Midland is making effective investments that generate returns above the cost of capital.\n\nPfizer (PFE) blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stock\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Vyndaqel and Prevnar product families\u2019 growth is one of the vital fundamental growth drivers for Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The company had a solid 47% operational growth globally in the Vyndaqel product family, including Vyndaqel, Vyndamax, and Vynmac.\n\nThis growth was based on the continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication, particularly in the US and developed Europe. Despite the growth, a large unmet demand remains because of the need for a more general understanding and diagnostic capabilities for this life-threatening disease.\n\nAdditionally, the Prevnar family of products, Prevnar 13 and Prevnar 20, witnessed a\u00a0global 15% year-over-year operational revenue rise (Q3 2023).\n\nStrong patient demand for Prevnar 20 Adult in the US, the approval of Prevnar 20 Pediatric in the US, and the growth of Prevenar 13 Pediatric in emerging markets lead to this increase. Interestingly, Prevnar 20 Adult maintained a\u00a095% market share in the US during the third quarter.\n\nFinally, these developments provide an ideal growth basis for Pfizer\u2019s topline and market value.\n\nAltria (MO) Altria office sign in Virginia capital city tobacco business closeup by road street\n\nSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAltria\u2019s (NYSE:MO) focus on the oral tobacco and nicotine pouch categories shows strategic diversification beyond traditional tobacco products.\n\nAltria acknowledges the sizable growth in the nicotine pouch category, with a nearly\u00a010% year-over-year increase (Q3 2023) in full nicotine pouches.\n\nThis increase aligns with market trends. The On! brand\u2019s performance includes a 33% sequential increase in retail prices and a 52% year-over-year increase. This demonstrates effective pricing strategies and consumer acceptance.\n\nAdditionally, the focus on improving profitability while growing market share is evident in the\u00a07.1% growth in adjusted operating company income for the oral tobacco products segment during Q3.\n\nInternationally, the launch of On! with positive consumer feedback in Sweden, PLUS suggests Altria\u2019s focus on exploring new markets and catering to global consumer preferences.\n\nFinally, the trends suggest progressive market leads, expansion, and evolving consumer engagement. This approach may continue to sustain growth in the oral tobacco and nicotine pouch categories, boosting the stock\u2019s valuation over the long term.\n\nBoeing (BA) Royal Air Force Boeing (BA) Chinook HC2A (352) [ZH895] lifting off from runway\n\nSource: InsectWorld / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) Boeing Defense Systems (BDS) operates in the defense and space sectors. There is a boost in operating performance within BDS.\n\nDespite the higher estimated costs of the\u00a0VC-25B program, Boeing asserts that these factors will maintain the performance and capability of the end product.\n\nBoeing focuses on recovering and normalizing BDS margin performance by 2025 and 2026. There are vital milestones within BDS, such as the delivery of the first T-7A to the US Air Force and the award from the US Army for\u00a021 Apache helicopters.\n\nThese attainments boost confidence in BDS despite a slower recovery than desired. To this point, the backlog at BDS stands at $58 billion, with a major portion outside the United States. Hence, this signifies the global vitality of Boeing\u2019s defense products.\n\nIn this context, Boeing outlines a three-tiered portfolio strategy for BDS, categorizing products based on their performance and prospects. The first tier represents a solid core business with products performing in the\u00a0mid-to-high-single-digit margin range.\n\nThe second tier includes specific fighter and satellite programs that negatively impact margins. Finally, the third tier comprises large fixed-priced development programs focusing on maturing and retiring associated risks.\n\nTherefore, coupled with strong demand, these developments frame a positive outlook for the business\u2019s value.\n\nWestern Union (WU) Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nWestern Union\u2019s (NYSE:WU) digital business growth may lead to a rapid boost in market capitalization.\n\nSpecifically, Western Union\u2019s focus on digital transformation has resulted in a positive growth in its digital business. In Q3 2023, the global branded digital business achieved\u00a03% revenue growth, a quarter ahead of the previous target.\n\nThe sustained growth in transactions at\u00a012% and the alignment of revenue growth with transaction growth suggest the leads of the company\u2019s digital strategy.\n\nFundamentally, the accelerated growth in Western Union\u2019s digital business is a pivotal aspect of its overall growth strategy. Achieving revenue growth early signifies effective implementation of the company\u2019s go-to-market program. The sustained growth in digital transactions indicates an increasing preference for digital financial services.\n\nFinally, the company\u2019s new go-to-market strategy has accelerated new customer acquisition, considerably reducing customer acquisition cost.\n\nThe branded digital business achieved positive revenue growth with a CAC decline of over\u00a020% year-to-date since efficiencies in the marketing program largely drive this. Hence, Western Union\u2019s focus on customer acquisition and cost efficiency may lead to value growth.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in INTC and PFE.

        "title": "Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN): This 5.2%-Yielding Dividend Stock Looks Juicy",
        "content": "Wendy\u2019s (NASDAQ:WEN) stock has underperformed the market, but the stock has a lot of potential, starting with its 5.2% dividend yield. Contrarian investors will find that there\u2019s quite a bit to like here. I\u2019m bullish on the $3.9 billion fast food stock, given its juicy dividend yield, its relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its restaurant stock peers, and several catalysts that could lead to a turnaround, such as a new CEO taking over and new involvement from activist investors who could push for further changes.\n\nNew CEO, New Activist Investors\n\nWendy\u2019s stock has slumped to a 14.0% loss over the past year, at a time when the S&P 500 (SPX) surged to a 21.8% gain, so some changes are likely needed, and changes are coming.\n\nWendy\u2019s recently announced that a new CEO, Kirk Tanner, will take the helm on February 5. Tanner has been at Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) for over 30 years and is currently leading the company\u2019s massive North American beverage business. While it\u2019s too early to say what Tanner\u2019s strategy will be, he appears to have the right kind of background for this role, and a fresh start under a new CEO could help to reinvigorate the business and the stock price.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly precedent for this in the restaurant industry. For example, former Taco Bell CEO Brian Niccol took over as Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) CEO in 2018 and has created tremendous value for shareholders in that time. Chipotle\u2019s stock price has more than tripled since he took over. I\u2019m not saying that this move by Wendy\u2019s will necessarily have the same level of impact, but the example shows that a change in leadership can be a catalyst for stocks in this industry.\n\nIn terms of other potential catalysts (or wildcards), Wendy\u2019s is also facing renewed pressure from activist investors, which could benefit shareholders.\n\nWhile legendary investor Nelson Peltz (who is now Wendy\u2019s Chairman of the Board) dropped his efforts to take the company private, a new activist is engaging in saber-rattling of its own. In December, Reuters reported that Blackwells Capital, an activist hedge fund, has plans to challenge Wendy\u2019s Board of Directors (namely Peltz) and to push for various improvements, although it\u2019s unclear what they are at this time.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say what the dynamic between the new CEO, Peltz, and the new activists will be, but with all of these new elements in play, more changes are likely on the horizon.\n\nTasty Dividend\n\nWhat I really like about Wendy\u2019s stock is that it packs a punch with its dividend. Shares of Wendy\u2019s currently yield an attractive 5.2%.\n\nThis yield is well above that of the average yield for the S&P 500 (SPX), which currently sits at 1.5%.\n\nNot only that, but Wendy\u2019s also yields significantly more than its closest peers like McDonald\u2019s (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) (TSE:QSR), the parent company of Burger King, which yield 2.1% and 2.8%, respectively.\u00a0Wendy\u2019s yield is also significantly higher than that of Taco Bell parent Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), which currently yields just 1.9%.\n\nWendy\u2019s doubled its dividend payout in 2023 (from $0.125 per quarter to $0.25), a strong signal that it is committed to creating value for its shareholders. In addition to this big-time dividend, Wendy\u2019s is also returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2023, Wendy\u2019s committed to buying back $500 million worth of shares through 2027, a significant amount for a company with a $3.9 billion market cap.\n\nCheaper Than the Market and Fast Food Peers\n\nTrading at 19.3 times earnings and 17.3 times projected 2024 earnings, shares of Wendy\u2019s aren\u2019t so cheap that value investors are going to be pounding the table over it, but they are cheaper than the broader market and those of its closest peers.\n\nThe S&P 500 currently trades at 22.1 times earnings. McDonald\u2019s trades at 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.3 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands International trades at 23.7 times trailing earnings and 22.4 times forward earnings. Similarly, YUM! Brands trades at 24.3 times trailing earnings and 22.2 times forward earnings.\n\nThese comparisons illustrate that there is plenty of room for Wendy\u2019s to attain a higher multiple in line with its restaurant peers and for shares to trade higher if the new management team can right the ship.\n\nIs WEN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, WEN earns a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, 11 Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average WEN stock price target of $21.73 implies 13.9% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway: Wendy\u2019s Stock Looks Attractive\n\nShares of Wendy\u2019s look attractive based on its 5.2% dividend yield and the possibility that changes driven by its new CEO or by activist investors could help bring its valuation more in line with those of its peers.\n\nDisclosure",
