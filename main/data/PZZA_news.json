        "title": "Domino's focused on winning the value battle, no matter who wins the White House",
        "content": "Domino's Pizza (DPZ) aims to win over consumers with its value proposition, regardless of the economic or political environment.\n\n\"No matter who's in the White House, no matter who's in Congress ... as long as the cards are dealt and everyone's dealt the same deck, as long as our competition and us, we've got the same parameters, I think we win,\" CEO Russell Weiner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIn Q2, Domino's US same-store sales slightly missed expectations with a 4.8% growth, compared to estimates of 4.92%.\n\nIts US company-owned businesses saw same store sales growth come in at 4.5%, versus the anticipated 6.08%. Franchisees were up 4.8%, versus the 4.87% expected. Domino's home page features a slew of ongoing value deals. (Screenshot taken by Yahoo Finance)\n\nWith ongoing deals like its $6.99 mix and match, which include various options like pizza, pasta, chicken, and desserts, or a $10.99 large 3-topping New York Style Pizza, which Weiner (a New Yorker) said is adding incremental customers, Domino's is trying to compete for dollars as eating out becomes increasingly expensive.\n\nThe company \"purposely\" raised prices when it needed to a couple of years ago, Weiner said, \"then we stopped,\" unlike many fast food competitors. Many chains are now introducing value meals to get consumers back.\n\n\"Our value is not whiplashing people, it's always been here, where it can be count on and you can get what you want,\" Weiner said, pointing to the company's growth across all income cohorts. It also posted positive growth in order counts for delivery and carryout last quarter.\n\nAs consumer confidence in the US trends lower, he expects consumers to keep coming.\n\n\"We've found ourselves during good times and bad now. As we continue to grow as a brand, we're [in a] pretty steady state through different economic times,\" Weiner said.\n\nMorningstar analyst Sean Dunlop said the company is \"pretty well positioned to compete in an environment like this.\"\n\n\"The average check for Domino's is about $22.50, you can feed somewhere between two and three people,\" he said, calling pizza as a category a \"pretty good per meal value.\"\n\nHowever, Domino's shared a pullback on international growth guidance when it reported Q2 results last Thursday. Coupled with a slight miss on its US results, its shares moved lower, down 21% in the last month alone.\n\nQ2 results \"did not live up to our elevated expectations\" Baird analyst David Tarantino wrote in a note to clients. Yet he's \"optimistic\" about the \"bigger picture,\" calling the top line results as \"fairly solid on an absolute/relative basis.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Domino's has the drivers in place to sustain standout comparable performance in upcoming periods amid an otherwise challenging macroeconomic backdrop,\" he wrote.\n\nUBS analyst Dennis Geiger said that US same store sales could potentially end the year with low-single digit growth, \"particularly in this unforgiving market.\" But the company has \"compelling catalyst path,\" with third-party delivery partnerships (like UberEats), menu innovation like New York style pizza, and gains from year two of its loyalty program.\n\nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh called the dip after earnings an opportunity to buy.\n\n\"We think Domino's is executing its domestic strategy brilliantly, gaining market share and driving traffic with all income groups, while the broader industry is struggling.\" Saleh added that \"traffic growth is a direct result of the rewards program change last year.\"\n\nAs it looks to keep prices low, Weiner is aware of new changes that could impact that ability, like higher wages in California.\n\nIt's important to note Q2 \"benefitted from 1.5%\" of price increases, \"which was inclusive of high single digits [increase] in California,\" CFO Sandeep Reddy said on the call.\n\n\"We haven't had closures [in California], we haven't had a layoff our drivers, like some of our competition has, but it's a long haul, and in the short term, you're definitely going to lose orders when you increase prices,\" Weiner said.\n\nAs repercussions of the higher wage begin to come to fruition, Yahoo Finance previously reported one McDonald's franchise owner made the decision to close one location.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "KO, PZZA, POST: Which Food Stock Is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "The last few years of inflation have changed how consumers shop and eat. Indeed, the best way for consumers to fight inflation is to simply put their wallets away or \u201ctrade down\u201d to cheaper alternative products. This past year has seen the pricing power of food, beverage, and restaurant brands be put to the test. Some brands have demonstrated remarkable pricing power, while others haven\u2019t been able to hike prices without hurting sales. Therefore, in this piece, we\u2019ll use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to check out three food and beverage stocks (KO, PZZA, and POST) with Strong Buy ratings from analysts.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO)\n\nCoca-Cola\u2019s quarterly earnings are on tap for next week (July 23, 2024). Wells Fargo (WFC) analyst Chris Carey thinks the numbers will be better than most other consumer staples plays, thanks in part to \u201cstructural changes\u201d that could provide meaningful (triple-digit) gross margin upside. Though shares have gone flat in the past two and a half years, I am inclined to stay bullish on KO stock as it feels the fizz ahead of coming earnings.\n\nIndeed, Coca-Cola is one of those legendary Warren Buffett-approved brands that\u2019s demonstrated top-notch pricing power amid an inflationary past few years. Though \u201ctrading down\u201d from big brands to generics has been a common theme at the grocery store, Coke has managed to fend off the threat of its cheaper rivals.\n\nRevenues beat expectations for five consecutive quarters (the latest saw $11.26 billion in sales, 2.3% ahead of estimates) as consumers continued reaching for Coke over generics. It\u2019s not a mystery as to why.\n\nSuch sugary sodas provide a great deal of enjoyment for the price. For many, opting for generic cola is not worth a dollar or so of savings. Coke is synonymous with cola, and in the eyes of many, it\u2019s the only option in the soda aisle. Perhaps Coke is one of the true consumer staples that can fare well in all environments, including inflationary and stagflationary ones.\n\nAt the time of writing, shares of KO are just 3% away from their all-time highs in early 2022. A solid earnings beat could make the consolidating soda firm break out. The stock trades at 22.8 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), about 7% lower than its five-year average.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Price Target of KO Stock?\n\nKO stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average KO stock price target of $69.50 implies 6.6% upside potential.\n\nPapa John\u2019s International (PZZA)\n\nPapa John\u2019s International is a pizza chain that really lost its way in recent years, shedding more than 66% in the last two and half years. The latest quarter had a rough showing, but CEO Rob Lynch has a turnaround plan named \u201cBack to Better 2.0\u201d in store for the firm as it hopes to reverse a brutal trajectory. Such a plan, which hopes to drive comparable sales, entails greater collaboration between corporate and franchisees. At this juncture, it seems that few investors are buying into the plan. Still, I\u2019m inclined to stay bullish with shares at historically cheap multiples.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have a strategic turnaround plan, but it\u2019s another to actually execute it and hit financial targets. Looking ahead, the firm seeks to increase comparable sales by 2-4%. That\u2019s a realistic target that management may be able to hit without putting in all too much effort should inflation back down and consumers start eating out again.\n\nEither way, the company is more than willing to put in the effort. Whether it\u2019s doubling down on menu innovation with intriguing new concepts like its Grilled Cheddar Pizza or revamping its marketing strategy, Papa John\u2019s is exploring numerous options to claw back some share in the pizza market.\n\nPapa John\u2019s has always been great at experimenting with hot new products. Only time will tell if consumers come flocking back to Papa John\u2019s to try the new item once they\u2019re made aware of it. Either way, the stock smells like a bargain at 19.5 times trailing P/E, the lowest it\u2019s been in the past year.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Price Target of PZZA Stock?\n\nPZZA stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average PZZA stock price target of $68.75 implies 55.2% upside potential.\n\nPost Holdings (POST)\n\nPost Holdings stock had been flatlining since hitting a peak back in February. More recently, though, the cereal and pet food firm broke out to new highs of around $110 as the stock market rally broadened out beyond big tech. With a strong operating track record and a hunger for strategic M&A, I\u2019m staying bullish on POST, especially as investors start appreciating boring companies lacking in AI exposure.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2024, Post is poised to invest $420-445 million in scaling up its facilities and also enhancing operating efficiencies. Indeed, these are pretty hefty capital expenditures for a consumer staples play. However, given Post\u2019s track record, I do not doubt that such investments will lead to sustained margin improvements. Arguably, Post is one of the best-run operators in the cereals and consumer-packaged goods scene.\n\nAt 20.7 times trailing P/E, POST stock is trading in line with the packaged foods industry average of 19.3 times. The slight premium, I believe, is more than warranted, given that the company is an efficient operator with a knack for unlocking synergies via strategic M&A.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of POST Stock?\n\nPOST stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with six Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average POST stock price target of $119.00 implies 8.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe following food and beverage stocks are relatively quiet consumer staple plays with enough catalysts to finish the year strong as market strength broadens. Whether we\u2019re talking about Coke\u2019s unmatched pricing power, Papa John\u2019s turnaround plans, or Post\u2019s operating excellence, each name is a well-deserved Strong Buy in the eyes of analysts.\n\nOf the trio, Wall Street sees PZZA stock as having the most room to gain (55%) in the year ahead. As the cheapest and most unloved of the three, investors who are fans of the brand may wish to grab a slice while it\u2019s down and out.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "FAT Brands Inc. (FAT) shares rallied 9.1% in the last trading session to close at $5.29. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 9.3% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nFAT Brands' rally is buoyed by optimism regarding the company\u2019s focus on unit expansion and acquiring new brands and restaurants. Positive investor sentiments were witnessed on the company's recent announcement of a 14 cents per share cash dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This dividend applies to both Class A and Class B common stock, payable on Aug 30 to shareholders of record as of Aug 15.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $2 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -277.4%. Revenues are expected to be $156.35 million, up 46.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor FAT Brands, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on FAT going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nFAT Brands belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Another stock from the same industry, Papa John's (PZZA), closed the last trading session 0.4% higher at $43.19. Over the past month, PZZA has returned -10.1%.\n\nPapa John's' consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed -0.5% over the past month to $0.52. Compared to the company's year-ago EPS, this represents a change of -11.9%.

        "title": "When Should You Buy Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)?",
        "content": "While Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$67.99 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$42.12. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Papa John's International's current trading price of US$42.12 reflective of the actual value of the small-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Papa John's International\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Papa John's International\n\nWhat Is Papa John's International Worth?\n\nGood news, investors! Papa John's International is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $69.48, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Papa John's International\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nCan we expect growth from Papa John's International? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Papa John's International's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 62%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since PZZA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on PZZA for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy PZZA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about Papa John's International as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

        "title": "Here's Why Investors Should Avoid Papa John's (PZZA) for Now",
        "content": "Papa John's International, Inc. PZZA has faced a turbulent 2024, with its stock down by a significant 44.7% year-to-date. This decline far outstrips the industry\u2019s overall 10.3% drop, underscoring the challenges the company is grappling with in a difficult macroeconomic environment, waning consumer confidence and dismal comps growth.\r\n\r\nAnalysts are also losing confidence in Papa John's stock. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 2024 and 2025 has been revised downward by 3.6% and 4.4% to $2.40 and $2.80, respectively.\n\nHeadwinds\n\nThe industry is grappling with challenges stemming from potential geopolitical events in an ever-changing global landscape. Papa John's closely monitors these situations and adapts its operations in affected regions accordingly. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s international comparable sales were negatively impacted by ongoing conflict in the Middle East, resulting in a 2.6% year-over-year decline compared to a 5.8% drop in the prior-year quarter at international restaurants. The company remains vigilant regarding international comparable sales due to the unpredictable international environment.\r\n\r\nDismal comps performance has been hurting investors\u2019 confidence. In the fiscal first quarter, total comparable sales lost 2% year over year compared with a 1.3% fall in the prior-year quarter. Domestic company-owned restaurant comps in the quarter under review declined 3% year over year against 3.4% growth in the year-ago quarter. At North America\u2019s franchised restaurants, comps dropped 1.5% year over year compared with a 0.8% decline in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company's outlook for the rest of the year indicates a cautious approach, with North America's comparable sales experiencing a slight decline in the first four weeks of the second quarter. This trend may continue due to ongoing economic challenges and weakening consumer confidence. The company adjusted its full-year guidance to reflect this cautious outlook, anticipating North America's comparable sales to range from flat to a slight decline for the entirety of 2024. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the array of challenges facing Papa John's\u2014from weak comparable sales, geopolitical risks and a cautious outlook\u2014investors have ample reason to be wary of its stocks. With analysts also scaling back their earnings expectations, the headwinds appear significant and persistent, making it a potentially risky bet for investors seeking stability and growth in their portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Picks\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are:\r\n\r\nBrinker International, Inc. EAT has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 213.4%, on average. EAT\u2019s shares have surged 74% in the past year. Currently, EAT sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Pizza Stocks to Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Papa John's Pizza, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) stands against the other pizza stocks.\n\nThe pizza market is experiencing steady growth. IMARC Group reported in their market analysis of global Pizza market types (Vegan and Non. Vegan) that the worldwide pizza market size reached a whopping $148.6 billion in the year 2023. Looking forward, the analysts expect the market to reach a value of $222.5 billion by 2032 showcasing a compound annual growth rate of 4.45 % during the fiscal periods of 2024 to 2032.\n\nPizza originated in Italy and is now popular all around the world owing to its versatile taste and texture. Many factors are involved in the growth of the industry, mainly the Westernized style of living, consumers' preference towards online food delivery, and lastly, the introduction of relatively healthy varieties like vegan, low-calorie, and gluten-free pizzas.\n\nAccording to technavio\u2019s 2024 - 2028 forecast, the frozen pizza market is projected to increase by $5.96 billion with a CAGR of 4.96% between 2023 and 2028, the high demand for frozen pizza is driven by factors such as seasonal fluctuations, consumer convenience of long-term storage time and the expansion of retail stores.\n\nAccording to research, in 2019 there were more than 2,45000 pizza restaurants in the world and around 77000 in the U.S. alone. Consumer spending studies suggest that from 2004 to 2019, consumers in the U.S. spent 10 billion dollars annually on pizza delivery. However, the industry experienced vast growth after the pandemic hit in 2019 resulting in increased spending on snacks ordered by using the mobile applications of fast food chains, this trend continued in 2021 when the pizza delivery peaked at $19.8 billion. Pizza was the most ordered food across the United States and the most favored fast food among all age groups in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the total number of pizza restaurants reached more than 80,000 units, an increase of 7000 units compared to the last 8 years. In 2022, the number of smaller independent restaurants was 44.6 thousand compared to 35.5 thousand chain restaurants.\n\nNevertheless, that same year analysts witnessed a considerable margin in the sales of pizza chain restaurants compared to sales of independent restaurants. Pizza chain sales exceeded independent units by more than $7 billion, dominating the U.S. market in 2022. Major players included Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ), and Pizza Hut of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM), and Little Caesar Enterprises Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE: DPZ) secured first rank based on most pizza chain distribution by number and highest annual sales figure of $8.5 billion. The Pizza Hut of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM) was placed on the second spot, with a sales report of over $5.2 billion.\n\nPizza Industry Trends Report 2024, in this study Pizza Today, surveyed 748 pizzeria owners from across the states, the findings are that online ordering is on the rise and 24.91% of respondents are investing to improve their online ordering technology. In addition, the pizzeria owners are investing 78.21% of their advertising budget on social media apps to derive more orders.\n\nMoreover, 65% of the business owners were optimistic that their annual sales would grow in the next 12 months, whereas 44% estimated a sales growth of 5% in 2024.\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nThough we compiled this list primarily with a focus on choosing pizza companies that make and deliver pizza, we also included some firms from which the pizza industry procures its raw materials and ingredients, for instance, cheese, flour, and toppings. We selected the following stocks that are popular among hedge funds, the list is compiled based on hedge fund sentiment towards each stock.\n\nTo draft this list, we have assessed Insider Monkey\u2019s database of hedge fund sentiment of 920 elite hedge funds tracked at the end of the first quarter of 2024. We arranged the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.\n\nA family gathering around a delivery pizza box in the comfort of their own home.\n\nPapa John's Pizza, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\n\nPapa John's Pizza, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is the fourth largest pizza delivery company in terms of the number of restaurant chains and popularity. The company operates delivery and dine-in restaurants under the trademark of Papa John\u2019s.\n\nThe pizza giant, in its income statement of Q1 2024, reported a revenue of $513.92 million, down 2% year over year. It was largely driven by lower revenues in North America\u2019s commissary segment due to commodity price declines.\n\nDespite these challenges, the company managed to launch 8 new units, on track to achieve North America\u2019s net unit growth of more than 20% relative to 2023 net unit openings. A net increase in revenues of about $10 million somewhat offset these declines, which could be attributed to the stores that made up the UK franchisee acquisitions.\n\nNet income in Q1 2024 was $14.64 million down 43.8% QoQ, attributed to the commodity price decline discussed above. Moreover, Papa John's reported an EPS of $0.67 in Q1 2024, beating the estimated $0.57.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of the first quarter of 2024, 22 hedge funds were bullish on Papa John's Pizza, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) and Citadel Investment Group managed by Ken Griffin had the highest stake valued at $154.39 million, highlighting a quarter over quarter growth of 87%.\n\nOverall PZZA ranks 7th on our list of the best pizza stocks to buy.

Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nThe 14 traditional fast food stocks we track reported a decent Q1; on average, revenues were in line with analyst consensus estimates. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance.

        "content": "Investors in Papa John's International, Inc. PZZA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 19, 2024 $35 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\n\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\n\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\n\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Papa Johns shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Papa Johns is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Retail - Restaurants industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 62 cents per share to 52 cents in that period.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Papa Johns right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nLooking to Trade Options?\n\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "title": "Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) Is Investing Its Capital With Increasing Efficiency",
        "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Papa John's International's (NASDAQ:PZZA) look very promising so lets take a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Papa John's International, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.28 = US$160m \u00f7 (US$847m - US$283m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Papa John's International has an ROCE of 28%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 10%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Papa John's International  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Papa John's International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freeanalyst report for Papa John's International .\n\nWhat Can We Tell From Papa John's International's ROCE Trend?\n\nPapa John's International is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 167% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nTo sum it up, Papa John's International is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Since the stock has only returned 2.8% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted  1 warning sign  facing Papa John's International that you might find interesting.\n\nPapa John's International is not the only stock earning high returns.

Today, we are looking at traditional fast food stocks, starting with Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR).\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal.

Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the traditional fast food stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 4.3% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR)\n\nFormed through a strategic merger, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) is a multinational corporation that owns three iconic fast-food chains: Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes.\n\nRestaurant Brands reported revenues of $1.74 billion, up 9.4% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 2.2%.

        "title": "Papa John's (PZZA) Down 36% YTD: What's Hurting the Stock?",
        "content": "Papa John's International, Inc. PZZA has been witnessing strong headwinds from a challenging macroeconomic environment, a decline in consumer confidence and uncertainty in international markets.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s shares have declined 35.7% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s 3.6% fall. Let\u2019s look at PZZA\u2019s earnings estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company. Earnings estimates for the fiscal 2024 and 2025 have been revised downward by 6.1% and 7.1%, respectively, in the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s discuss the factors that are likely to impact this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company\u2019s growth potential.\n\nPrimary Concerns\n\nChallenges in Comps Performance: Dismal comps performance has been hurting investors\u2019 confidence. In the fiscal first quarter, total comparable sales declined 2% year over year compared with a 1.3% fall reported in the prior-year quarter. Domestic company-owned restaurant comps in the quarter under review declined 3% year over year against 3.4% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. At North America franchised restaurants, comps dropped 1.5% year over compared with a 0.8% decline reported in the year-ago quarter. Comps growth at North America restaurants declined 1.8% year over year. Lower transactions and a decline in organic delivery primarily drove the downside. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nImpact of International Conflict on Comps: During first-quarter fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s international comps were negatively impacted by ongoing conflict in the Middle East. During the quarter, comps at international restaurants were down 2.6% year over year compared with 5.8% in the prior-year quarter. The company is vigilant about international comparable sales due to the unpredictable international environment.\n\nCautious Outlook and Guidance Adjustment: The company's outlook for the rest of the year indicates a cautious approach, with North America's comparable sales experiencing a slight decline in the first four weeks of the second quarter. This trend may continue due to ongoing economic challenges and weakening consumer confidence. The company adjusted its full-year guidance to reflect this cautious outlook, anticipating North America's comparable sales to range from flat to a slight decline for the entirety of 2024.\n\nMacroeconomic Challenges and Uncertainty in International Markets: In the past two years, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, coupled with a dynamic geopolitical landscape, have hindered the pace of new international restaurant openings for 2024. Despite reporting 23 new restaurant openings internationally in first-quarter 2024, this was partly offset by 29 closures, primarily in certain Middle Eastern markets and China. Looking ahead, PZZA is cautious about macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty in international markets.\r\n\r\nDebt Concerns: PZZA\u2019s weak liquidity position is also concerning. At the end of the fiscal first quarter, the long-term debt net totaled $761.3 million compared with $757.4 million at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Its debt to capitalization at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2024 came in at 231.1%, almost flat sequentially. The company ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $27.8 million (down from $40.6 million as of fiscal 2022 end), which may not be enough to manage the high debt level.\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks to Consider\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector include:\r\n\r\nWingstop Inc.

        "content": "Papa John\u2019s International PZZA, the pizza delivery and takeout shop with nearly 6,000 locations globally has struggled in recent years with flat sales growth and falling profits.\n\nIn 2024, the stock has been collapsing, and its stock price is approaching four-year lows, reflecting extremely bearish investor sentiment.\n\nWhile I do believe Papa John\u2019s will still be around in the future, the company is overvalued based on its floundering growth rates and was recently downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.\n\nBecause of these bearish factors, I think investors should avoid Papa John\u2019s International stock for now and seek better opportunities in the market. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nPZZA: Collapsing Earnings Estimates\n\nAnalysts have unanimously lowered earnings estimates for PZZA across timeframes. Current quarter earnings estimates have fallen by -14.3% over the last month, and current year earnings estimates by -6.5%.\n\nCurrent year earnings are forecast to fall -9.2% YoY.\n\nPapa John\u2019s International has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating and sits in the bottom 38% (145 out of 248) of the Zacks Industry rank. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPapa John's Elevated Valuation\n\nAs of today, Papa John\u2019s International has a one year forward earnings multiple 20.1x, which is below the market average and below its 10-year median of 29x.\n\nHowever, those higher valuations of the past reflected higher growth estimates, so unless the company can turn that around, we could see that multiple fall even further. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs of today, I think there are far better opportunities in the stock market than Papa Johns, and thus investors should focus on those prospects.\n\nHowever, I will say that I do believe Papa John\u2019s International does enjoy an enduring brand that could recover, although the takeout food space grows increasingly competitive. Additionally, with the company paying a dividend yield of 3.8%, income investors could soon be interested.\n\nBut I would recommend avoiding the stock until there is a marked improvement in the earnings estimates and Zacks Rank before considering getting involved.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Feeling the Pinch: 7 Restaurant Stocks Most at Risk as Consumers Dine Out Less",
        "content": "Dining out may have gained popularity during the post-lockdown recovery, but based on recent data, the American public may be losing some of its appetite for fast food, fast casual, and other dining establishments. This leaves restaurant stocks at risk of declining in price.\n\nStocks in this sector have already been squeezed by factors like high inflation. During 2022 and 2023, the popularity of dining out stayed strong despite higher prices and smaller portions, but with U.S. economic growth slowing down, it\u2019s not surprising that dining demand is finally slowing down as well.\n\nYes, some restaurant chains appear to be still thriving, despite the challenges. However, among the dozens of publicly-traded restaurant stocks, quite a few appear to be experiencing issues with declining same-store sales and downbeat outlook.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at seven restaurant stocks at risk, and see whether they\u2019re still worthy of a buy, despite this major headwind.\n\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) Cracker Barrel Old Country Store sign on the outside of one of its locations\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor quite some time, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (NASDAQ:CBRL) has been dealing with a slump in customer traffic. Starting in 2023, the chain, best known for its down-home cuisine and kitschy decor, began to experience a decline in same-store sales.\n\nSo far this year, declines have persisted. Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino has admitted that the company faces a long road ahead when it comes to a comeback. Yet while all of this hardly sounds bullish for CBRL stock, today\u2019s troubles may already be baked into its valuation, especially after CBRL\u2019s latest sharp pullback.\n\nOn May 17, shares declined by double-digits, following news of the company slashing its dividend by 80% to fund its turnaround. While it may take years to happen, if a turnaround is successful, and CBRL\u2019s annual earnings climb back above $10 per share, chances are it would at least double from current prices.\n\nDenny\u2019s (DENN) outside of a denny's restaurant\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough already down by more than 25% year-to-date, Denny\u2019s (NASDAQ:DENN) remains one of the restaurant stocks at risk of additional drops in price. As seen in the its latest quarterly earnings release, the diner chain reported declining sales at both company-owned and franchised locations.\n\nWhile net income was up year-over-year, taking into account a one-time accounting adjustment in the prior year\u2019s quarters, adjusted net income per share dipped by around 15.4%, from 13 to 11 cents per share. The company may be guiding for same-store sales to hold steady for the full year 2024, but if overall dining demand keeps trending lower, Denny\u2019s may have to make a downward revision to this guidance.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven worse, factors like labor inflation could eat further into the company\u2019s profitability. This may mean lower earnings per share than currently anticipated, which in turn would likely place even more pressure on DENN stock.\n\nDine Brands Global (DIN) din stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDine Brands Global (NYSE:DIN) is the parent company of Applebee\u2019s and IHOP. Earlier this month, the restaurant operator reported its results for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. For the quarter, Dine Brands reported declining domestic same restaurant sales.\n\nIHOP sales fell by 1.7% year-over-year. Applebee\u2019s sales fell by 4.6%, an even greater amount. As a company in an industry with high fixed costs, these single-digit sales declines resulted in a sharp 35% drop in GAAP earnings compared to Q1 2023.\n\nAlthough guidance suggests more challenges ahead, if you\u2019re looking to make a contrarian wager on a comeback in dining out demand, DIN stock could be the perfect vehicle. Shares trade at a super low 7.4 times forward earnings. If demand picks back up, and the company\u2019s decision to grow IHOP and shrink Applebee\u2019s ultimately pays off, there could be big upside potential for shares.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) olive garden (dri) sign on front of building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDarden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is best known for being the owner of Olive Garden. However, the full-service restaurant operator has many other chains in its portfolio, including Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House and LongHorn Steakhouse.\n\nEven so, Darden hasn\u2019t been immune to the aforementioned change in dining trends. During the company\u2019s fiscal third quarter (ending Feb. 25, 2024), only LongHorn reported same-store sales growth. The other chains reported year-over-year declines. Since the release of these numbers in March, DRI stock has been trending lower.\n\nTrading for 17 times forward earnings, shares do look pricey given the challenges. Still, as Seeking Alpha commentator Chuck Walston pointed out last month, Darden\u2019s pivot towards high end dining, plus its scale advantages, may help to outweigh the impact of declining sales at its fast casual chains. Also, as I pointed out recently, Darden\u2019s aggressive repurchasing of shares could help provide a lift as well.\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group (FWRG) A close-up shot of the awning of a First Watch (FWRG) restaurant in University Park, Florida.\n\nSource: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Watch Restaurant Group (NASDAQ:FWRG) operates a chain of breakfast-focused casual dining establishments. In recent years, First Watch has reported strong growth, with current sales more than double where they were before the pandemic.\n\nHowever, while waning restaurant demand may not be driving declining sales for the chain, it may be starting to hinder First Watch\u2019s growth. Last quarter, same store sales growth came in at just 0.5%. Overall revenue may have increased by 14.7%, but this top line result fell short of analyst expectations.\n\nConcerned about a growth slowdown, investors have bid down FWRG stock in recent weeks. Trading for $25 per share before the revenue miss, shares now trade for just over $19 per share. With the stock trading for a rich 45.7 times forward earnings, further indication of a slowdown may result in a sharp de-rating to the downside for FWRG.\n\nJack in the Box (JACK) stocks to sell\n\nSource: LifetimeStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nBesides its namesake fast food chain, Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK) also owns Del Taco, another west coast fast food chain. Unfortunately, this high west-coast exposure means high exposure to an industry headwind specific to the region.\n\nThat would be California\u2019s recent minimum wage increase for fast food workers to $20 per hour. Higher wages of course mean higher prices for the company\u2019s menu items across its two chains. Both Jack and Del Taco reported declining same stores sales for the preceding fiscal quarter.\n\nHowever, declines could get worse. The minimum wage increase didn\u2019t kick in until the tail end of last quarter. JACK stock trades for just 8.7 times forward earnings. This suggests that uncertainty related to the wage hike is priced-in. Even so, it may be safer to consider JACK one of the restaurant stocks at risk, and stay away until at least the quarterly earnings release.\n\nPapa John\u2019s International (PZZA) Billboard From Papa John's At Amsterdam East The Netherlands\n\nSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com\n\nPapa John\u2019s International (NASDAQ:PZZA) is yet another restaurant company reporting weak results as of late. On May 9, the Louisville, Kentucky-based pizza restaurant operator reported declining same store sales during the preceding quarter, driven by weakness in the North American market.\n\nAlthough Papa John\u2019s International (emphasis on the \u201cinternational\u201d) is reporting same store sales weakness in non-U.S. markets, overseas expansion is helping to partially outweigh this weakness. Irrespective of where Papa John\u2019s is struggling however, what\u2019s most of interest to investors is whether to buy the recent dip in PZZA stock.\n\nSince March, PZZA has fallen from the low-$70s to the low-$50s per share. Yes, recent results aren\u2019t exactly promising. The stock is quite pricey compared to other hard-hit restaurant stocks. Shares trade for 21.7 times forward earnings. Still, as InvestorPlace\u2019s Rick Orford recently pointed out, analysts are bullish about a possible comeback.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Restaurants\u2019 gross margins are increasing because the prices that they pay for goods, services and labor are no longer rising rapidly. Some of their costs are increasing slowly, while others are falling. Instead of lowering prices in response to their easing cost pressures, restaurant chains are reporting higher profits and/or buying back their shares. For example, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), mentioned that it has seen labor costs stabilize and lower-than-expected commodity prices. With restaurant chains getting a boost from easing cost pressures and strong spending by the top 30% or so of wage earners, here are three top restaurant stocks to buy.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) The Shake Shack (SHAK) on 125th Street in Harlem, New York City, USA\n\nSource: Here Now / Shutterstock.com\n\nShake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stock rose almost 6% in the last month, and 70% in the last six months. It\u2019s safe to say, SHAK is indeed sizzling.\n\nIn March, Shake Shack tapped Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) CEO Rob Lynch to take its top spot. Under Lynch, who became CEO of Papa John\u2019s in 2019, the pizza chain\u2019s operating income surged from $19.8 million in 2019 to $156.4 million last year. As a result, I expect Shake Shack to continue to perform very well over the long term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn the first quarter, the chain\u2019s revenue jumped 15% versus the same period a year earlier to $290.5 million, while its EBITDA jumped 30% year-over-year to $35.9 million.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has become one of the top restaurant stocks to buy in America and is quite popular among millennials, whose spending power is rapidly increasing. The firm\u2019s revenue jumped 14% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier to a huge $2.7 billion. Moreover, its comparable restaurant sales climbed a rather impressive 7% year-over-year in Q1.\n\nThe firm is also benefiting from the previously mentioned profit-margin gains. Indeed, Chipotle\u2019s operating margin came in at 26.3% last quarter, up from 15.5% in Q1 of 2023. As a result, it\u2019s not surprising that the company\u2019s earnings per share jumped 14% year-over-year to $13.01.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Dailygives Chipotle its highest possible Composite Rating of 99, and the shares have risen over 40% so far this year.\n\nDutch Bros (BROS) Dutch Brothers (BROS) at Papago Plaza in Scottsdale Arizona. restaurant stocks to buy\n\nSource: RicoPatagonia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI believe that Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been meaningfully hurt by strong, growing competition from Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS).

These companies show signs of being neglected by the market or are simply beaten down by bearish sentiment.\n\nInvestors sometimes like to find picks that can spring back up from an anticipated catalyst or even a seasonal event like Christmas. Who can blame them? If there are predictable ways to make money, why wouldn\u2019t an investor take advantage of it?\n\nSince we\u2019re looking for stocks that\u2019ll likely do well around Christmas, I\u2019ll focus on companies with higher activity during the season \u2013 such as traveling and gift-giving. To come up with my list, I screened companies that fit the following criteria:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShipping, Travel, and Consumer Discretionary sectors Stocks trading near its 52-week low based on percentage distance Buy ratings from analysts At least five analysts cover the stock\n\nI then sorted them based on how close the stocks were to their 52-week low and picked the bottom three.

        "title": "Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 3.5% Yield",
        "content": "Readers hoping to buy Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. This means that investors who purchase Papa John's International's shares on or after the 17th of May will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of May.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is US$0.46 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.84 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Papa John's International has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current stock price of US$53.32. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Papa John's International can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.\n\nView our latest analysis for Papa John's International\n\nDividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 79% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (63%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. It's encouraging to see Papa John's International has grown its earnings rapidly, up 96% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing at a rapid rate, yet the company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Papa John's International has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHas Papa John's International got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that Papa John's International is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Papa John's International today.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in Papa John's International for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Papa John's International that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

Net Income: Totaled $14.64 million, down 34.6% from the previous year, below estimates of $21.07 million. Earnings Per Share (EPS): Recorded at $0.44, a decrease from $0.65 year-over-year, falling short of the estimated $0.67. Adjusted Operating Income: Increased by 10.4% to $43.24 million, indicating improved cost management and operational efficiency. Global System-Wide Restaurant Sales: Declined by 0.9% to $1.23 billion, influenced by a calendar shift that moved a high-volume week to the previous fiscal quarter. Comparable Sales: North America down by 2%, and International down by 3%, reflecting challenges in both domestic and international markets. Free Cash Flow: Experienced a significant shift to an outflow of $1.07 million from an inflow of $22.38 million in the prior year, primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PZZA.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, Papa John's International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA) disclosed its financial outcomes for the first quarter, ending March 31, 2024, through an 8-K filing. The company, a significant player in the global quick-service restaurant pizza market, reported a mixed financial performance with earnings per share aligning closely with analyst projections but falling short on revenue expectations.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nPapa John's operates over 5,900 restaurants across nearly 50 countries, primarily through a franchised system. The company generates revenue from franchise royalties, sales at company-owned stores, and its commissary supply chain operations. It holds a strong position as the fourth-largest limited-service pizza chain globally and in the U.S., with significant operations in the UK, China, South Korea, and Chile.\n\nFinancial Performance Highlights\n\nThe first quarter saw a decrease in North America and international comparable sales by 2% and 3% respectively. Despite these challenges, the company managed to open 8 net new units, driven by growth in North America. Total revenues for the quarter stood at $513.9 million, down by 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity prices impacting the North America commissary segment.\n\nOperating income decreased by 11% to $34 million, while adjusted operating income saw a 10% increase to $43 million, reflecting improved restaurant-level margins and stringent cost controls. Diluted earnings per share were reported at $0.44, down from $0.65 in the same quarter the previous year, with adjusted diluted earnings per share at $0.67, nearly aligning with the previous year's $0.68.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic Initiatives and Leadership Commentary\n\nRavi Thanawala, Papa John's Interim CEO and CFO, emphasized the disciplined approach to business operations and the progress on strategic initiatives like Back to Better 2.0 and International Transformation. These initiatives aim to enhance restaurant operations, digital solutions, and marketing platforms to drive long-term growth.\n\n\"Our teams are taking a disciplined approach to running the business, improving restaurant-level margins and increasing operating profits despite a challenging environment in the first quarter,\" said Ravi Thanawala.\n\nOperational and Financial Metrics\n\nThe decrease in global system-wide restaurant sales by 1% to $1.23 billion was attributed to the calendar shift of the high-volume week between Christmas and New Year's into the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported a free cash flow outflow of $1.1 million, compared to an inflow of $22.4 million in the prior year, reflecting timing differences in working capital payments.\n\nOutlook and Future Prospects\n\nDespite the current economic challenges, Papa John's is focused on enhancing its operational efficiency and maintaining robust growth in the global market. The company's ongoing initiatives and strategic focus are expected to bolster its position and profitability in the competitive quick-service restaurant industry.\n\nFor detailed financial figures and further information, refer to the full 8-K filing by Papa John's International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA).\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Papa John's International Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.67 per share, down from its profit of $0.68 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Papa John's? Find out in our full research report.\n\nPapa John's (PZZA) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $513.9 million vs analyst estimates of $543.1 million (5.4% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.67 vs analyst estimates of $0.56 (19.1% beat) Gross Margin (GAAP): 31.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was -$1.07 million, down from $40.4 million in the previous quarter Same-Store Sales were down 2% year on year\u00a0(miss) Store Locations: 5,914 at quarter end, increasing by 189 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $1.88 billion\n\n\u201cOur teams are taking a disciplined approach to running the business, improving restaurant-level margins and increasing operating profits despite a challenging environment in the first quarter,\u201d said Ravi Thanawala, Papa Johns Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nFounded by the eclectic John \u201cPapa John\u201d Schnatter, Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a globally recognized pizza delivery and carryout chain known for \u201cbetter ingredients\u201d and \u201cbetter pizza\u201d.\n\nTraditional Fast Food\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nSales Growth\n\nPapa John's is larger than most restaurant chains and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge over its smaller competitors.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 5.7% over the last five years was weak , but to its credit, it opened new restaurants and expanded its reach. Papa John's Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Papa John's missed Wall Street's estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 2.5% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $513.9 million in revenue. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.8% over the next 12 months, an acceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nStory continues\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is a key performance indicator used to measure organic growth and demand for restaurants.\n\nPapa John's demand has been shrinking over the last eight quarters, and on average, its same-store sales have declined by 0.9% year on year. This performance isn't ideal and the company should reconsider its growth strategy before opening new restaurants with its precious capital. Papa John's Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Papa John's same-store sales fell 2% year on year. This decrease was a further deceleration from the 1.5% year-on-year decline it posted 12 months ago. We hope the business can get back on track.\n\nKey Takeaways from Papa John's Q1 Results\n\nPapa John's same-store sales and revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations. On the other hand, operating profit beat. Zooming out, we think this was a mixed quarter. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $56.9 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Papa John's right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

The foundational improvements we are implementing in our restaurant operations, digital solutions, and marketing platforms are designed to drive sustainable, profitable growth around the globe. We are confident that our consumer-centric focus and drive to increase franchisee profitability will contribute to our long-term success.\"\n\n\"The Board of Directors has great confidence in the work that is taking place under Ravi and the Papa Johns leadership team,\" said Christopher Coleman, Chair of the Board. \"This team, which has significant restaurant, digital, and international experience, is executing on our strategy and evolving our business model for the next chapter of growth. Importantly, their strategic execution is driven by their passion and vision for the Papa Johns brand and an unwavering focus on the consumer and our franchisees. Concurrent with the team\u2019s efforts, the Board is conducting a thorough search process for our next Papa Johns CEO to lead this work into the future.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\n(a) North America and International comparable sales are reported on a 13-week basis comparing January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024 with January 2, 2023 through April 2, 2023.

The lower revenues were largely attributable to a $9.3 million decrease in North America commissary revenues reflecting decreased commodity prices in the quarter and, to a lesser extent, lower transaction volumes, and a $9.1 million decrease in Other revenues, which includes $5 million resulting from the sale of Preferred Marketing, our formerly wholly-owned print and promotions company, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenues from Domestic Company-owned restaurants also declined $3.6 million, reflecting lower transaction volumes partially offset by higher average ticket.\n\nSomewhat offsetting these declines was a net increase of approximately $10 million of revenues attributable to the stores comprising the UK franchisee acquisitions.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, global system-wide restaurant sales were $1.23 billion, down 0.9% from the prior year quarter (excluding the impact of foreign currency). The decrease was due to the prior year first quarter having an approximate $9.9 million benefit from the high-volume week between Christmas and New Years, which occurs in the fiscal fourth quarter in 2024. This decline was partially offset by 3.3% net unit growth on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nFirst quarter Operating income was $33.7 million, a $4.1 million, or a 10.8% decrease compared with the prior year first quarter. Adjusted operating income(a) was $43.2 million, a $4.1 million, or 10.4%, increase from the same period a year ago. The variance between Operating income and Adjusted operating income was due to $9.5 million of International restructuring costs primarily reflecting $7.6 million of non-cash leased and fixed asset impairment charges related to upcoming restaurant closures in the UK.\n\nAdjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2024 improved $4.1 million, primarily attributable to approximately $7 million related to equity forfeitures and local marketing savings. Additionally, improved margins in our Domestic Company-owned restaurants and North America commissary segments contributed to the current year growth. These increases were largely offset by: (1) an approximate $4 million year-over-year impact related to the operations of the UK franchisee acquisition when taking into consideration a first quarter 2024 operating loss and first quarter 2023 franchise royalty fees; (2) higher depreciation costs related to the UK franchisee acquisitions and our investments in technology platforms; and, (3) lower North America comparable sales.\n\nDiluted earnings per common share was $0.44 for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $0.65 in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share(a) was $0.67 for the first quarter of 2024 compared with $0.68 in the first quarter of 2023. These changes were driven by the same factors impacting Operating income and Adjusted operating income as discussed above. In addition, diluted earnings per common share and adjusted diluted earnings per common share reflected higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate compared with the first quarter of 2023. Interest expense increased largely due to higher borrowings used to fund share repurchases towards the end of the first quarter of 2023 and higher average interest rates compared with the prior year first quarter. The higher income taxes in the first quarter of 2024 reflect the impairment charges related to the International Restructuring program as well as the shortfall from the vesting of long-term equity awards, resulting in an additional tax expense when compared with the prior year period.\n\nSee the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for additional information concerning our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n(a) Represents a Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation to the most comparable US GAAP measures.\n\nGlobal Restaurant Sales Information\n\nGlobal restaurant and comparable sales information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared with the first quarter ended March 26, 2023 are as follows (See \"Supplemental Information and Financial Statements\" below for related definitions):\n\nThree Months Ended Amounts below exclude the impact of foreign currency March 31, \r\n2024 March 26, \r\n2023 Comparable sales growth (decline): Domestic Company-owned restaurants (3.0 )% 3.4 % North America franchised restaurants (1.5 )% (0.8 )% North America restaurants (1.8 )% \u2014 % International restaurants (2.6 )% (5.8 )% Total comparable sales growth (decline) (2.0 )% (1.3 )% System-wide restaurant sales growth (decline): Domestic Company-owned restaurants (2.0 )% 4.9 % North America franchised restaurants (1.6 )% 0.8 % North America restaurants (1.7 )% 1.6 % International restaurants 1.4 % 3.3 % Total global system-wide restaurant sales growth (decline) (0.9 )% 2.0 %\n\nGlobal Restaurant Unit Data\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, there were 5,914 Papa Johns restaurants operating in 49 countries and territories, as follows:\n\nFirst Quarter Domestic Company Owned Franchised North America Total North America International Company Owned International\n\nFranchised Total International System-wide Beginning - December 31, 2023 531 2,902 3,433 117 2,356 2,473 5,906 Opened 5 16 21 \u2014 23 23 44 Closed \u2014 (7 ) (7 ) \u2014 (29 ) (29 ) (36 ) Ending - March 31, 2024 536 2,911 3,447 117 2,350 2,467 5,914 Net unit growth/(decline) 5 9 14 \u2014 (6 ) (6 ) 8 Trailing four quarters net store growth 16 47 63 117 9 126 189\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure which the Company defines as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property and equipment, was an outflow of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with inflows of $22.4 million in the prior year period. The year over year change primarily reflects unfavorable working capital changes driven by the timing of payments.\n\nThree Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, \r\n2024 March 26, \r\n2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,987 $ 40,788 Purchases of property and equipment (13,058 ) (18,410 ) Free cash flow $ (1,071 ) $ 22,378\n\nWe view free cash flow as an important financial measure because it is one factor that management uses in determining the amount of cash available for discretionary investment. Free cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of free cash flow might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company\u2019s performance than the Company\u2019s GAAP measures.\n\nCash Dividend\n\nThe Company paid cash dividends of $15.1 million ($0.46 per common share) in the first quarter of 2024. On May 2, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a second quarter dividend of $0.46 per common share. The dividend will be paid on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2024.\n\nConference Call\n\nPapa Johns will host a call with analysts today, May 9, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Comparable sales, Comparable sales growth (decline), Global system-wide restaurant sales and Global system-wide sales growth (decline) exclude franchisees for which we suspended corporate support.\n\n\"Equivalent units\" represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period, adjusted for restaurants opened, closed, acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis.\n\nWe believe Domestic Company-owned, North America franchised, and International Comparable sales growth (decline) and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is useful in analyzing our results since our franchisees pay royalties and marketing fund contributions that are based on a percentage of franchise sales. Comparable sales and Global system-wide restaurant sales results for restaurants operating outside of the United States are reported on a constant dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Franchise sales also generate commissary revenue in the United States and in certain international markets. Comparable sales growth (decline) and Global system-wide restaurant sales information is also useful for comparison to industry trends and evaluating the strength of our brand. Management believes the presentation of Global system-wide restaurant sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, provides investors with useful information regarding underlying sales trends and the impact of new unit growth without being impacted by swings in the external factor of foreign currency. Franchise restaurant sales are not included in the Company\u2019s revenues.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they reflect metrics that our management team and Board utilize to evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to adjusted operating income, adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are operating income, net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share, respectively. These non-GAAP measures should not be construed as a substitute for or a better indicator of the Company\u2019s performance than the Company\u2019s U.S. GAAP results. The table that follows reconciles our GAAP financial results to our non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThree Months Ended (In thousands, except per share amounts) March 31, \r\n2024 March 26, \r\n2023 Operating income $ 33,718 $ 37,796 International restructuring costs (a) 9,523 \u2014 Other costs (b) \u2014 1,356 Adjusted operating income $ 43,241 $ 39,152 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 14,636 $ 22,376 International restructuring costs (a) 9,523 \u2014 Other costs (b) \u2014 1,356 Tax effect of adjustments (c) (2,152 ) (309 ) Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders $ 22,007 $ 23,423 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.44 $ 0.65 International restructuring costs (a) 0.29 \u2014 Other costs (b) \u2014 0.04 Tax effect of adjustments (c) (0.06 ) (0.01 ) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share $ 0.67 $ 0.68\n\nRefer to footnotes on following page.\n\nFootnotes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n(a) Represents costs associated with the Company\u2019s International Restructuring plan. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, these costs are comprised primarily of leased and fixed asset impairment charges related to planned store closures in the UK, combined with severance and other related costs. (b) Represents severance and related costs associated with the transition of certain executives, recorded in General and administrative expenses. (c) The tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments was calculated by applying the marginal tax rates of 22.6% and 22.8% for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and March 26, 2023, respectively.\n\nPapa John\u2019s International, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (In $ thousands, except per share amounts) March 31, \r\n2024 December 31, \r\n2023 (Unaudited) Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 27,768 $ 40,587 Accounts receivable, net 94,506 104,244 Notes receivable, current portion 5,802 5,199 Income tax receivable 1,906 2,577 Inventories 38,073 36,126 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 57,872 42,285 Total current assets 225,927 231,018 Property and equipment, net 273,303 282,812 Finance lease right-of-use assets, net 30,747 31,740 Operating lease right-of-use assets 153,880 164,158 Notes receivable, less current portion, net 11,010 12,346 Goodwill 75,975 76,206 Other assets 76,325 76,725 Total assets $ 847,167 $ 875,005 Liabilities, Redeemable noncontrolling interests and Stockholders\u2019 deficit Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 61,014 $ 74,949 Income and other taxes payable 22,487 17,948 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 143,401 158,167 Current deferred revenue 20,727 20,427 Current finance lease liabilities 8,495 9,029 Current operating lease liabilities 24,710 24,076 Current portion of long-term debt 1,800 \u2014 Total current liabilities 282,634 304,596 Deferred revenue 18,780 20,366 Long-term finance lease liabilities 23,726 24,144 Long-term operating lease liabilities 143,797 151,050 Long-term debt, less current portion, net 761,317 757,422 Other long-term liabilities 62,395 60,192 Total liabilities 1,292,649 1,317,770 Redeemable noncontrolling interests 941 851 Stockholders\u2019 deficit: Common stock ($0.01 par value per share;

The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $543.9 million, suggesting growth of 3.2% from the year-ago levels.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nQuarterly revenues are likely to have been boosted by expansion endeavors, initiatives to enhance sales and focus on digitalization. PZZA has been investing significantly in technology-driven strategies, particularly in digital ordering, aiming to stimulate sales.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, Papa John's has notably expanded its online presence and digital marketing efforts, aligning with the increasing use of online and mobile technologies. These endeavors are expected to have contributed positively to its revenue growth. The company\u2019s loyalty program continues to witness a rise in digital transactions. Features like early access to new products, better targeting of offers and promotions, and higher frequency and tickets are likely to have boded well.\r\n\r\nWe expect domestic company-owned restaurant sales and international revenues to increase 2.4% and 26.3% from the year-ago levels, respectively. We project North America commissary revenues and North America franchise royalties & fees to rise 1.7% and 1.6% from the year-earlier actuals, respectively. On the other hand, dismal comparable sales are likely to have negatively impacted the\u00a0 top line in the quarter under discussion.\r\n\r\nHigh cost is likely to have hurt PZZA\u2019s bottom line. Higher performance-based compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, as the company continued to invest in its restaurants and technology support, are likely to have driven costs in the quarter to be reported.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, PZZA expects G&A expenses to be between $70 million and $75 million, resulting from increased tech investments over the last three years.\r\n\r\nShares of the company have lost 24% year to date compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 1.5%. The decline can be primarily attributed to high costs and dismal comps performance.\n\nPapa John's International, Inc.

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $543.94 million, exhibiting an increase of 3.2% compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\n\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates.

Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Papa John's metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- North America franchise royalties and fees' stands at $36.65 million.

Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 3.4% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Number of Restaurants - System-wide' should arrive at 5,925. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 5,733 in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Number of Restaurants - Franchised North America' will reach 2,912.

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for Papa John's International is US$81.02 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current share price of US$63.10 suggests Papa John's International is potentially 22% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 2.6% higher than Papa John's International's analyst price target of US$78.95\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Papa John's International\n\nThe Model\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$121.9m US$130.3m US$159.0m US$171.4m US$181.9m US$191.0m US$199.0m US$206.1m US$212.8m US$219.0m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Est @ 7.79% Est @ 6.14% Est @ 4.98% Est @ 4.18% Est @ 3.61% Est @ 3.21% Est @ 2.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6%  US$112 US$110 US$124 US$123 US$120 US$116 US$112 US$106 US$101 US$95.8\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.1b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$219m\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (8.6%\u2013 2.3%) = US$3.5b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.5b\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$1.5b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$63.1, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Papa John's International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.376. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Papa John's International\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nDividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "content": "Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated\n\nCalifornia fast-food employees started earning a minimum of $20 an hour in April.\n\nThanks to a new law, which went into effect earlier this month, California chain restaurants with at least 60 locations nationwide have to pay their employees more.\n\nFor smaller restaurants, the minimum wage continues to be the statewide bottom of $16 an hour.\n\nThe largest publicly-traded fast-food companies include McDonald\u2019s Corp (NYSE:MCD); Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX); Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC; Wendys Co (NASDAQ:WEN); Restaurant Brands International Inc (NYSE:QSR), which owns Burger King; Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG); Papa John\u2019s International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA) and Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ:JACK).\n\nMany of these stocks have lost value since the law was implemented on April 1.\n\nRead Also: AI Gunning For Fast Food Jobs Next? KFC, Taco Bell Operator Yum Brands Planning ChatGPT-Like Bots To Boost Operations\n\nThe wage hikes were deemed necessary in the Golden State. After all, the cost of living in California is about 38% higher than the national average.\n\nSome fast food companies are considering cutting employee hours and raising menu prices.\n\nIn-N-OutBurger President Lynsi Snyder said in an interview with Today that she \"was sitting in VP meetings going toe-to-toe saying, \u2018We can't raise the prices that much, we can't.\u2019\"\n\nHer company, which owns over 400 restaurants \u2014 primarily in California \u2014 continues to be privately held. Snyder said there are no plans to go public or open up to the franchise model.\n\nIn-N-Out has, however, raised prices in Los Angeles restaurants by about 25 cents per burger. That\u2019s still less than the price hikes other restaurants had to implement.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, one Burger King in Los Angeles raised the price of its Double Texas Whopper by 12% from $15.09 to $16.89.\n\nMany restaurant chains started preparing for wage hikes, even before the law was passed last September. Some companies are exploring automation as a strategy \u2014 a trend that took off in 2017 with self-service ordering kiosks.\n\nInsider reported that some restaurant franchises, including a major Burger King franchise, are ordering new digital order kiosks to replace existing staff.\n\nBurger King management recently pointed out that customers tend to order larger meals whenever interacting with digital self-service screens.\n\nIn October, after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the law, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's third-quarter earnings call he expected the policy to \"certainly be a hit in the short term to franchisee cashflow.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the secondary effects of the new law could even replicate into further trouble for the fast food segment in the Golden State. A Jack in the Box franchise owner speculated on Sunday in an interview with Business Insider that rising prices for fast food chains could mean a loss in market share to casual diners like Chili\u2019s, owned by Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) or Applebee\u2019s, a subsidiary of Dine Brands Global Inc (NYSE:DIN).\n\nCasual dining restaurants could, in turn, benefit if they're able to keep running without altering prices.\n\nNow Read: Wendy\u2019s Clarifies \u2018Dynamic Pricing\u2019 Comments After Public Outcry, Elizabeth Warren Criticism\n\nImage from MidJourney AI.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report TESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Not-So-Happy Meal: $20 Wages Has Burger Joints In This State All Heated originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Growth stocks rocketed in the first quarter as markets priced in Federal Reserve rate cuts. Indeed, based on history, the best growth stocks to buy in April will benefit if the Fed cuts rates.\n\nAccording to Schroders, stocks have had an average return of 11% since 1928, twelve months after the Fed began rate cuts.

First, the unemployment rate is at 3.8%. Secondly, real wage growth has been positive over recent months, which will buoy consumer spending.

First, in February, it reported impressive fourth quarter results that beat expectations. Total revenue was $286.2 million, growing 20% year over year (YOY). Shake Shack sales were up 2.8%, and it opened 41 new restaurants.\n\nAnother reason for the rally was the recent appointment of Rob Lynch as CEO. He has led Papa John\u2019s International (NASDAQ:PZZA) since 2019 and brings in a wealth of experience. His marketing and operational expertise will be valuable in the next phase of Shake Shack\u2019s expansion.\n\nAlso, the restaurant has made significant improvements in profitability. In 2023, restaurant-level operating margins improved by 240 basis points to 19.9%. Management expects more improvements through order customization, tradeups, enhanced labor deployments and supply chain optimization.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, management expects more growth in 2024 through more Shake Shack openings. They estimate 40 licensed openings and 40 domestic company-operated openings. Given these growth catalysts, analysts are bullish. TD Cowen sees upside to $125 driven by margin improvements, minimal leverage and a new CEO.\n\nThus, Shake Shack has a long-term growth runway as it opens more restaurants. With increasing scale, profit margins will expand going forward.\n\nDLocal (DLO) Mobile phone with webpage of Uruguayan payment company dLocal Limited (DLO) on screen in front of logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nFintechs are disrupting traditional finance and winning in the process.

TPV was up 67% YOY and revenue was $650 million, representing 55% growth. It is worth noting that most of the growth was from existing merchants as DLocal gained wallet share.

Management expects a record total payment volume in 2024, with 40% to 50% growth. They also forecast adjusted EBITDA between US$220 and US$260M, maintaining the focus on profitable growth.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit\u00a0Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.\n\nIn the realm of cautious trading before the quarter concludes, global stocks in Asia witnessed a mixed performance. As investors brace for the Federal Reserve's upcoming release of crucial inflation data later this week, a sense of prudence prevails. Japan's Finance Minister issued a cautionary note against excessive fluctuations in the yen, underscoring the sensitivity of currency markets amid uncertain economic conditions. In this landscape, Julius Baer discerns a trend of capital flowing into Japanese equities, marking a potential shift in investment patterns. This observation hints at evolving investor sentiments and strategic reallocations within the financial markets.\n\nLooking ahead, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve's forthcoming release of its key inflation gauge data, slated for Friday. This data release is expected to provide crucial insights into the trajectory of inflation, influencing market sentiment and potentially steering investor strategies in the days to come. As traders navigate through these uncertain waters, the cautious stance underscores the importance of strategic positioning and prudent risk management in the ever-fluctuating landscape of global financial markets.\n\nIn February, new home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped by 0.3%, attributed to rising mortgage rates during the month. Despite this decline, the overall trend remains robust amidst a persistent shortage of existing homes in the market, reported Reuters. Notably, the median price of new homes recorded its lowest figure in over 2-1/2 years, while the supply reached its highest level since November 2022. Builders are responding to market dynamics by increasing construction efforts, offering price reductions, and adjusting floor plans to enhance affordability. This strategy seems to be stabilizing housing activity, with sales maintaining a relatively steady pace and prices experiencing moderate declines year-over-year. Although economists had anticipated a rise in new home sales, the actual figures reflect a slight contraction, emphasizing the volatility inherent in monthly data. Despite multiple interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve since March 2022, the new homes market has remained resilient, primarily due to the limited availability of existing homes for sale. While the housing market appears to be turning a corner, the persistent supply shortage continues to exert upward pressure on house prices, hindering access to homeownership for many. However, the recent decline in the median new house price is welcomed by economists as it suggests improvements in affordability and could help mitigate inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, despite some regional variations, surveys indicate a positive outlook for new home sales, supported by builder optimism and ongoing efforts to expand supply. Nonetheless, the sustainability of current incentives offered by builders remains uncertain, posing potential challenges to future market dynamics. Overall, amidst fluctuations in mortgage rates and supply dynamics, the new homes market in the U.S. demonstrates resilience, though challenges persist in achieving long-term affordability and accessibility for prospective homebuyers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn financial markets, notable equities such as Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

(NYSE:PFE)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.07 (+0.26%)\n\nOn March 22, analysts at Argus Research made a significant adjustment to their evaluation of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), a leading player in the pharmaceutical industry. The analysts downgraded Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock rating from Buy to Hold, citing concerns about \"near-term headwinds\" that the drugmaker is expected to encounter in its journey toward revenue growth. The decision to downgrade Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) likely reflects a comprehensive assessment of various factors affecting the company's performance, including its revenue projections, margin outlook, and patent expiration risks. The analysts pointed out that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) revenue growth forecast of 3% to 5%, excluding COVID-19 products and the Seagen acquisition, represents a decrease from the 7% growth experienced in 2023. They also highlighted the anticipated decline in revenue from COVID-related products, which is expected to result in lower gross and operating margins. Moreover, Pfizer faces the challenge of offsetting revenue declines from products that will lose patent protection and exclusivity between 2025 and 2030. This necessitates finding alternatives to compensate for the approximate $17 billion in annual revenue that these products are projected to lose due to loss of exclusivity (LOE). As a result of these factors, the analysts have revised down their adjusted earnings per share (EPS) estimate for Pfizer in 2024 to $2.15 from the previous estimate of $3.25.\n\nLooking ahead, the analysts have set a new EPS estimate of $2.70 for 2025 and adjusted the forecast for the five-year EPS growth rate to 7%, down from the earlier projection of 9%. These adjustments reflect the analysts' cautious outlook on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) future earnings potential and growth prospects within the pharmaceutical sector. Despite the downgrade, investors responded with a modest increase in Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) stock price, which rose by 0.26% on March 25, closing at $27.43. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have tempered their optimism about Pfizer's near-term performance, others may still see potential value in the company's long-term strategy and pipeline of products. The market's response underscores the complexity of evaluating pharmaceutical stocks and the importance of considering various factors impacting their performance.\n\n06. PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF)\n\nPrice Reaction after the Downgrade: +0.02 (+0.04%)\n\nOn March 22, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar made a notable adjustment to his assessment of PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF), a prominent player in the oil refining industry. Kumar downgraded PBF Energy's stock rating from Buy to Neutral, indicating a shift in his recommendation for investors. Despite the downgrade, Kumar raised the price target for PBF Energy from $52 to $58, suggesting a revised expectation for the company's future valuation. While the downgrade indicates a more neutral stance on PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock, the upward revision of the price target suggests that Kumar still sees potential upside for the company, albeit at a more moderate level than previously anticipated. This nuanced approach may reflect Kumar's belief that while PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) may not offer the same level of investment opportunity as before, it still has room for growth and value appreciation. Following the downgrade, investors responded with a marginal increase in PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) stock price, which rose by 0.04% on March 25, closing at $56.30. This reaction suggests that while some investors may have adjusted their expectations in light of the downgrade, others may still perceive PBF Energy Inc. (NYSE:PBF) as a viable investment option within the oil refining industry. The market's response underscores the complexity of evaluating energy stocks and the importance of considering a range of factors when making investment decisions.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Analysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution 14 Best Climate Change Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest In\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Best Buy upgraded, Nike downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nJPMorgan upgraded Best Buy(BBY) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $101, up from $89. The analyst believes the company's share of wallet pull-forward in computing, TVs and appliances is at, or nearing, an end, with a higher installed based of electronics nationally supporting a \"soft landing\" this year. Redburn Atlantic upgraded Verizon(VZ) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $39, up from $33, implying 4% potential downside to the current share price. The analyst cites improving subscriber trends, the company's exposure to falling rates and \"healthy dividend cover\" for the upgrade. Citi upgraded Foot Locker(FL) to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $24, up from $19. The firm says that while there is no guarantee Foot Locker will benefit from Nike's (NKE) product pivot, there seems to be a higher likelihood Foot Locker could see better allocation. TD Cowen upgraded Charles Schwab(SCHW) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $87, up from $70. The firm believes the backdrop is \"incrementally more conducive\" for the retail broker dealers for net interest margins and capital markets, noting that its latest EPS revisions put it \"at or above consensus mostly.\" Janney Montgomery Scott upgraded Sunnova Energy(NOVA) to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged fair value estimate of $12. While the firm is not adjusting its overall thesis on the growth and margin outlook, it notes that the several weeks of significant trading weakness following the company's Q4 report have been \"generally more acute and pronounced than what we had originally expected in February.\"\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nRBC Capital downgraded Nike to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $100, down from $110. Nike's unexpected first glance guidance for the first half of 2025 implies no revenue growth for calendar 2024, \"which leaves little to play for in the near term,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note. Argus downgraded Pfizer(PFE) to Hold from Buy. The company is faced with near-term headwinds to its top-line growth as it has guided to 2024 3%-5% revenue growth ex-COVID products and Seagen acquisition, down from 7% growth in 2023, the firm says. Janney Montgomery Scott downgraded SolarEdge(SEDG) to Neutral from Buy with a $63 fair value estimate after catching up with the company's head of IR, J.B. Lowe, last week. The commentary from the meeting was consistent with Q4 earnings call commentary in late February around channel inventory destocking trends in the U.S. and Europe, the competitive landscape in the U.S. and Europe. Goldman Sachs downgraded Stem(STEM) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $2.50, down from $5.50. The analyst sees a lack of catalysts in the near-to medium-term and believes the stock's risk/reward no longer skews as positive pending better execution following several periods of weaker than expected financial results. BTIG downgraded Papa John's(PZZA) to Neutral from Buy with no price target following the departure of CEO Rob Lynch, who is leaving to assume the same post at Shake Shack (SHAK). Given the \"sudden nature of this announcement\" and lack of seasoned leadership at Papa John's, the firm thinks the company could struggle until a new leader and game plan are announced, the analyst tells investors.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nPiper Sandler last night initiated coverage of Constellation Brands (STZ) with an Overweight rating and $300 price target. The analyst expects long-term, sustainable U.S. share gains in beer, helped by demographic and distribution tailwinds. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Array Technologies(ARRY) with a Market Perform rating and $16 price target. The analyst is constructive on global demand for solar trackers and believes excluding China total addressable markets will more than double by the end of the decade, but despite a current deep valuation discount, Array's recent results and guidance suggest a reduction of market share, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Citi initiated coverage of Talos Energy(TALO) with a Buy rating and $16.50 price target. The analyst favors the company's \"prudent strategy\" composed of a balanced combination of acquisitional and organic growth with moderate operational upside. Capital One initiated coverage of GitLab(GTLB) with an Overweight rating and $72 price target.",

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to look at 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on the population dynamics of the world, and how declining birth rates are changing those dynamics, you can go directly to 5\u00a0Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million.\n\nAlthough the world population sits healthy at 8 billion mark as of 2024, the global demographic landscape is undergoing a transformative shift, with declining birth rates playing a pivotal role in the discussion on overpopulation, especially in countries with numerous cities surpassing one million inhabitants.\n\nOver the past 70 years, countries worldwide have experienced a remarkable decrease in birth rates, which mirrors evolving societal norms and economic progress. Notably, nations like China and South Korea have witnessed a substantial decline in birth rates, dropping by over 80% since 1950. While declining birth rates signify advancement in socio-economic development and a shift towards prioritizing education and career over starting families, they also introduce challenges associated with an aging population and potential labor shortages.\n\nThe balance between low birth rates and overpopulation in cities presents complex scenarios, necessitating thoughtful urban planning and sustainable development strategies to address the strain on resources and social services. As the global fertility rate has declined significantly over the past five decades to 2.3, falling below the critical replacement level of 2.1, the implications of this demographic shift on overpopulation are increasingly pertinent.\n\nThe need for proactive measures to navigate the consequences of declining birth rates is crucial, ensuring a balanced approach to population dynamics, sustainable urban growth, and inclusive societal development. In the United States, the downward trend in birth rates has been notable, with a nearly 23% decrease since the Great Recession, highlighting the need for understanding the implications of this demographic transformation. Immediate attention and strategic interventions are essential to address the challenges posed by declining birth rates and to create a balanced equilibrium between low birth rates and the potential impacts of overpopulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nVarious industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, construction, retail, and services, have strong ties to densely populated countries. These sectors rely on factors like labor availability, access to resources, market demand, and robust infrastructure that are typically abundant in highly populated regions. So, before we move to our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, let\u2019s look at how such global businesses are doing as of now. Namely, we are going to discuss Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA).\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)\n\nPapa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) Papa John's, a leading pizza provider, has capitalized on the expanding global population, recognizing the direct correlation between the food market and worldwide population growth. Recently, franchisees of Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) in North America made a strategic decision to elevate their contributions to the national marketing fund, aligning with a new marketing strategy set to launch in 2024. This initiative follows a comprehensive review of the brand's creative and media efforts in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Papa John's International, Inc. expanded its global presence by opening a net total of 45 restaurants in the third quarter, bringing the brand's worldwide unit count to 5,825 by the end of September 24, encompassing operations in North America and international markets. In 2023, Papa John's unveiled 210 new units, spanning North America and international regions, demonstrating the brand's commitment to strategic growth and market diversification.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon, a dominant player in e-commerce and digital streaming, leverages the global population growth to drive innovation in response to evolving market demands.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) experienced robust growth in net sales, with a 14% increase totaling $170.0 billion compared to the same quarter in 2022. Notably, the North America segment saw a 13% sales surge, reaching $105.5 billion, while international sales spiked by 17% to $40.2 billion. The impressive results were fueled by the successful holiday shopping season, featuring record-breaking events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, where customers worldwide purchased over 1 billion items, leading to substantial savings. These outcomes underscore Amazon's strong customer engagement and business expansion across diverse segments.\n\nKimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB)\n\nRenowned for its innovative baby and child care products, Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) reported modest growth in Personal Care sales, reaching $2.6 billion in the quarter ending 31st December 2023, showing a 2% increase. The company's success is attributed to advancements in innovation, effective commercial strategies, and supply chain enhancements, resulting in notable volume growth, particularly in North America with a 4% sales surge. Overall, the Personal Care segment displayed a 1% growth in 2023, with 5% organic sales growth, indicating widespread progress across regions. 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million\n\nA crowded Wall Street plaza, bustling with people carrying briefcases.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo construct our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, we referred to World Population Review\u2019s dataset consisting of population of 802 cities of the world. From this data set, we extracted all the cities with population exceeding 1 million mark. Seeing which country each city belongs to, we came up with the number of cities of respective countries that have population greater than 1 million, and that\u2019s how we came up with our list of 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Please note that the countries that stood equal with the number of cities exceeding 1 million mark population, we ranked those based on the accumulated population of the cities of the respective countries that exceed 1 million mark.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Thailand\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nIn 2023, Thailand's demographic profile showed a notable imbalance, with over 13 million individuals aged 60 and above, contrasting with fewer than 500,000 newborns. The population has experienced a decline of approximately 35,000 people over the past two years. If this downward trend persists, projections suggest that Thailand's current population of 66 million could decrease by more than half in under 50 years. Thailand makes it to our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million at 20th position. Bankok, Chon Buri and Songkhla are few cities in Thailand with population above 1 million mark.\n\n19. France\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nIn France, as of January 2023, the total population stands at 68.0 million, with a marginal increase of 0.3% in 2022. The total fertility rate in 2022 stood at 1.80 children per woman, down from 1.84 in 2021. This alarming trend requires immediate attention and action to address the implications for each respective country's demographics. Paris, Lilli and Lyon are three of the six cities in France with population above 1 million.\n\n18. Canada\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nCanada is 18th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Based on data from Statistics Canada, Canada's population has witnessed a significant surge, reaching an estimated 40,528,396 on October 1st, 2023, encompassing citizens and residents. This uptick corresponds to an additional 430,635 individuals, signaling a notable growth rate of 1.1% since July 1st, 2023. This growth marks the highest population increase observed in a quarter since the second quarter of 1957 when Canada's population expanded by 1.2%. During that period, Canada's population stood at 16.7 million, with growth largely attributed to post-war baby boom births and an influx of refugees following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa are few cities with population above 1 million.\n\n17. Vietnam\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nAccounting for roughly 13 million individuals, Generation Z, comprising individuals born between 1997 and 2012, constitutes approximately 19% of Vietnam's population. As of 2025, this demographic cohort is expected to represent about one-third of the country's workforce, making them key contributors to Vietnam's developmental trajectory. Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Can Tho are three of the biggest cities in terms of population in Vietnam.\n\n16. South Africa\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nJohannesburg, Cape Town and Ekurhuleni are 3 largest cities in terms of population size in South Africa.\n\nIn comparison to other BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), South Africa is relatively young, yet it is considered older by African standards. It is placed at 16th place on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Seniors make up 5.9% of South Africa's population, with children comprising 28.6%. To provide further context, Russia has 15.8% seniors and 17.2% children, while China's demographics include 13.7% seniors and 17.7% children. Within the sub-Saharan region, the average percentage of seniors stands at 3.0%, contrasted with 41.8% for children. These figures illustrate the demographic distribution and age profiles of various countries in different parts of the world.\n\n15. Colombia\n\nNumber of Cities: 6\n\nColombia's total population is projected to steadily rise from 2023 to 2028, increasing by a total of 2.6 million individuals (+4.98%). With this growth trend continuing for the tenth consecutive year, the total population is expected to reach 54.78 million people, marking a new peak in 2028. The country has seen consistent population growth in recent years.\n\n14. Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nNumber of Cities: 7\n\nIn 2023, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is ranked as the fourth most populous country in Africa, following Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Egypt, with a population of 102 million. Globally, it holds the 15th spot among the world\u2019s most populated countries. With projections indicating a significant increase, the DRC is expected to reach a population of 215 million by the year 2050, positioning it among the top 10 most populated countries globally. This growth aligns with the vast size of the country, spanning 2.3 million square kilometers, making it the second-largest country in Africa, after Algeria. DRC is placed 14th on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Bogota, Medellin and Cali consist of the largest population in DRC.\n\n13.

Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya are top cities in Japan in terms of population sizes.\n\n12. Iran\n\nNumber of Cities: 9\n\nIran's population is predominantly concentrated in the northern, northwestern, and western regions, which aligns with the presence of the Zagros and Elburz Mountains. In contrast, the central and eastern areas of the country, including the areas surrounding the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut deserts, exhibit significantly lower population densities. Tehran, Mashhad and Esfahan have the largest population in Iran.\n\n11. US\n\nNumber of Cities: 10\n\nUSA is the 11th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. The rural (nonmetro) population in the United States is experiencing growth once more following a decade of overall population decline. From July 2020 to June 2022, there was approximately a 0.25% increase in population. This growth was fueled by a higher number of people moving into rural areas than leaving, surpassing the population decrease resulting from natural causes (more deaths than births). The rise in remote work following the COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in this notable shift in migration patterns. New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago are biggest cities in U.S. in terms of population sizes.\n\n10.

Pakistan is 9th country on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million. Pakistan's biggest cities in terms of population sizes include Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad.\n\n8. Turkey\n\nNumber of Cities: 11\n\nA notable reduction in T\u00fcrkiye's annual population growth in 2023 is seen. While the population previously increased by 7.1 per thousand in 2022, the growth rate has decreased to 1.1 per thousand in 2023, marking the country's lowest level in its history. The previous record for the lowest annual population growth rate was observed in 2020 during the severe pandemic conditions, when the growth rate stood at 5.5 per thousand. Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir are the most popualted cities in Turkey.\n\n7. Russia\n\nNumber of Cities: 15\n\nAlthough Russia is a country with a healthy population \u2013 34.3 million people living in these 15 cities alone \u2013 it is currently facing a significant demographic crisis, attributed to prevailing uncertainties in the economic and political environment. The demographic data presents a cause for concern. In August 2023, Russia reported a sharp 29% decline in the natural population during January-June 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, dropping from 383,800 to 272,500. The number of deaths saw a substantial 12.8% decrease from 1,019,000 to 888,700. Notably, the natural population decrease in 2022 exhibited a significant 42.5% decline from 1,042,675 in 2021 to 599,616. Urgent measures are essential to address this pressing demographic challenge in Russia. Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk are the most populated cities in Russia.\n\n6. Nigeria\n\nNumber of Cities: 16\n\nNigeria, placed 6th on our list of Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million, consists of a diverse population that demonstrates various ethnic groups, with the Hausa comprising 30%, followed by the Yoruba at 15.5%, and the Igbo (Ibo) at 15.2%. The Fulani ethnic group accounts for 6% of the population, while the Tiv and Kanuri/Beriberi communities each represent 2.4%. Additionally, the Ibibio and Ijaw/Izon groups make up 1.8% each, with the remaining 24.9% classified under other ethnicities based on estimates from 2018. This distribution highlights the rich cultural tapestry present within Nigeria's population. Lagos, Kano and Abuja are the three cities with largest population in the country.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about the 5 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2030 20 States with the Oldest Population in the US 20 Countries With The Largest Jewish Population In The World\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Countries with Most Cities Over 1 Million is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Earnings Update: Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) Just Reported Its Full-Year Results And Analysts Are Updating Their Forecasts",
        "content": "Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 2.6% to US$69.94 in the week after its latest yearly results. Papa John's International reported US$2.1b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.48 beat expectations, being 3.5% higher than what the analysts expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Papa John's International  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Papa John's International from 16 analysts is for revenues of US$2.19b in 2024. If met, it would imply a modest 2.8% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to increase 4.9% to US$2.63. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$2.22b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.77 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year.\n\nThe consensus price target held steady at US$82.00, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Papa John's International analyst has a price target of US$97.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$65.00. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Papa John's International's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 2.8% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 6.9% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.5% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Papa John's International is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Papa John's International. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\n\nWith that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Papa John's International. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Papa John's International going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nThat said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we get into our 2023 results and our 2024 strategic initiatives, I'd like to take a moment to briefly reflect on the progress that we've made over the last 5 years. When I joined Papa John's in 2019, system-wide sales North America units and operating income were rapidly declining. Since then, our team and franchisees have worked incredibly hard to rebuild the brand and regain consumer loyalty. Their focus and diligence during some of the most dynamic times in our industry has strengthened Papa John's and positioned us for sustainable growth in the QSR space. To our team members and franchisees, thank you for your commitment and dedication to our customers, our values and our brand and for playing a key role in our success.\n\nBecause of these efforts, today, we are reporting another year of record global system-wide sales, our fourth consecutive year of positive North America comps accelerating North America unit growth and adjusted operating income with a 5-year CAGR of approximately 12%. More importantly, we made foundational improvements to our restaurant operations, grew our global restaurant footprint, improved our menu with innovative new products and advanced our digital and marketing platforms to support the evolution of our business model for our next chapter of growth. Our product innovation rooted in our brand promise of better ingredients, better pizza continues to be at the heart of our success. In 2023, we expanded some of our most popular platforms with the Garlic Epic Stuffed Crust Pizza, Doritos, Cool Ranch, Papadias and new Popabytes, including Oreo and Twix Flavors.\n\nWe also introduced new innovations like our Crispy Parm pizza, becoming the first large pizza chain to put cheese on the bottom of the crust and brought back fan favorites like our Shaq-a-Roni, pizza. We also executed on our back-to-better 1.0 initiatives, driving operational improvements to deliver better pizza with better service. At our company-owned restaurants, we've reduced our out-the-door times nearly 25% to average under 20 minutes today, and we've seen our overall customer satisfaction scores continue to improve. This great work has earned us the number one ranking in customer service for the pizza category on the American Customer Satisfaction Index in 2023. We also continue to lean into our domestic third-party aggregator partnerships as sales through this channel reached another high in the fourth quarter, growing more than 10% sequentially and up more than 50% from a year ago.\n\nAs we've mentioned on past calls, there continues to be a lot of room for category expansion in this channel. We have seen that new competitors entering the marketplace does not necessarily lead to significant volume loss for a brand like ours that has been thriving in this space for years. Our quarter-to-date trends have continued to increase relative to our fourth quarter run rate, and we have increased our market share in this channel. In early January, we announced Back to Better 2.0. These initiatives are designed to drive best-in-class pizza QSR unit economics through higher sales, higher restaurant level margins and higher return on investment on new domestic restaurant openings, our largest and most profitable market. As part of our efforts to enhance our domestic national marketing investment and effectiveness, we went through an extensive advertising and media review process aimed at sharpening our analytics informed approach to marketing and consolidating and optimizing our partners at the national level to drive scale.\n\nAs a result of this process, we have shifted to a more productive, nationally focused marketing model. We are increasing the per store investment in the National Marketing Fund from 5% to 6% of sales beginning in the second quarter of 2024, while eliminating the 3% required local spend. The required marketing contribution rate decreases from 8% to 6% and brings the added benefit of an immediate 200 basis points of margin at the restaurant level, along with a bigger impact from their marketing spend. I am thankful for the overwhelming support we received from our franchisees on this change. More than 90% of the system voted in favor, highlighting the confidence our franchisees have in our go-forward marketing strategy. This includes improved audience selection, improved return on ad spend, sustained loyalty and increased cultural buzz.\n\nOur new partners are ramping quickly, and we look forward to sharing how our marketing programs are evolving on future calls. Additionally, we are optimizing our investments in data science and marketing technology to enhance our consumer value perception driven by occasion, daypart and brand. Part of our success in driving positive sales over the past several years has been our ability to strike the right balance between ticket and transaction growth. This is accomplished through our barbell strategy that offers premium innovation while delivering on the needs of our valued customers. We're focused on delivering value at every segment of our business, whether that is through promoted price points, our core menu or premium innovations. Moving to unit development and how we are incentivizing our franchisees to grow.\n\nIn November, we launched a new development incentive to improve the return on capital investment of new domestic restaurants by waiving national marketing fund contributions for the first 5 years. This equates to 600 basis points of annual cost savings in their restaurant P&Ls for the first 5 years or an approximately $360,000 total benefit that will significantly improve the cash-on-cash payback for our developing franchisees who open new units in 2024. This incentive will now extend into 2025, offering 3 years of national marketing fund relief or approximately $216,000 average benefit for new units opened in 2025. Currently, in North America, we have more than 100 units in our pipeline at various stages of development. We are confident that this incentive program, which delivers best-in-class cash-on-cash returns, coupled with improved restaurant margins, customer service levels, marketing efficiencies and technology and analytics platforms will drive sustained development momentum for Papa John's.\n\nGiven the business model changes associated with Back to Better 2.0, these restaurants built in 2024 have the potential to be some of the most profitable restaurants in our system. All of these strategic actions are designed to drive strong top line sales and more volume, which in turn makes our supply chain more productive. We are evolving our commissary business and increasing our fixed operating margin to drive profitable growth for our company while improving supply chain productivity and delivering long-term cost savings for our system. For example, our franchisees can now earn an annual incentive-based rebates as they increase volume in open new restaurants. The incremental volume driven by increased marketing and additional development will reduce the shared supply chain costs across the system.\n\nWe are excited about these initiatives and the value that they will create for Papa John's and for our North America franchisees, not only as they ramp up in 2024, but over the next several years. Now to our international business. Over the past 10 years, we have more than doubled our international footprint and now operate in 50 countries and territories. As we pursue our next phase of international growth, we're evolving our business model to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our customers and franchisees ensure targeted investments and efficient resource management and better position our largest markets for long-term success. Beyond new unit development, it's about sustainably and profitably growing all of our restaurants globally.\n\nThis past year, we've made significant enhancements to our international organization and infrastructure. As part of these efforts, we established international regional hubs in key target regions, Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. These hubs are led by experienced general managers who are partnering with franchisees to create holistic strategies to drive profitable sales in their markets. Our teams are now aligned at the corporate and local levels to execute global best practices in operations, marketing and technology to accomplish our long-term objective of increasing market share in key markets around the world. To support our international teams and franchisees, we are investing in consumer-facing technology, digital infrastructure and enhanced financial and operational reporting.\n\nBy investing in expanded ordering capabilities through our website and app and leveraging analytics, we expect to improve conversion, increased customer retention and deliver faster consumer insights to franchisees. This playbook is similar to what we successfully implemented within the U.S. over the past few years, and we expect it to be equally successful as we expand this investment strategy globally. We are also making progress on our repositioning efforts within the U.K. market and expect to improve in profitability during 2024. In 2023, we supported the transition of 61 underperforming U.K. franchised restaurants to other more proven U.K. franchisees. We have seen a significant improvement in the performance of these locations with their fourth quarter comp sales finishing well ahead of the other restaurants within the U.K. market.\n\nIn fact, the fourth quarter was the second consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for our U.K. franchisees. If you'll recall, in June, we announced the transition of 118 U.K. franchise restaurants to company ownership. As anticipated, these new company-owned U.K. restaurants were dilutive to 2023 adjusted operating income by approximately $9 million, which takes into consideration the restaurant's current year operating loss and the foregone prior year royalties. Similar to the other U.K. restaurants that transition to new owners, we are seeing sequential improvements in the performance of our company-owned restaurants. Together, our company-owned restaurants and franchise locations in the U.K. are reporting positive comps to start 2024, and we continue to explore options to maximize the value and cash flow of our U.K. portfolio, ensuring alignment of the region and its performance with our long-term strategy.\n\nWe have also made the decision to close approximately 50 underperforming company-owned restaurants in the second quarter of 2024. These restaurants accounted for roughly two thirds of our operating loss in the U.K. in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to evaluate our remaining portfolio as well as our franchisee locations, focusing on sales trends, overall profitability and their lease and loan obligations. Through this process, additional strategic closures could occur as we look to drive improved profitability for our remaining stores, optimize trade zones and striking our franchisee base within this important market. In this dynamic global environment, our industry is facing challenges from the potential impact of geopolitical events. We are closely monitoring these situations and will maintain flexibility with our operations in those impacted regions. A family gathering around a delivery pizza box in the comfort of their own home.\n\nWe are committed to our international transformational initiatives as we believe they best position us to realize our next phase of global growth and set our largest markets up for long-term success. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi to cover the financial portion of today's call. Ravi?\n\nRavi Thanawala: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to echo Rob's sentiments and thank the entire Papa John system for their focus and commitment to driving forward our strategic priorities during this past year towards our ambition to become the QSR brand of choice for consumers and franchisees around the world. Now for a closer look at our fourth quarter financial results. Global system-wide restaurant sales were $1.34 billion, up 11% in constant currency from the prior year fourth quarter. The increase was largely attributable to the shift in our 2023 fiscal calendar to include a 14th week in the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately 9 percentage points of growth. Outside of the extra week, global system-wide sales were up approximately 2% in the quarter, driven by new restaurant openings and higher North America comparable sales.\n\nOur 2% increase in North America comp sales was a result of increases in transaction and taking growth for both our domestic company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants. We continue to see higher transactions driven by our aggregator channel, while our ticket growth is supported by the work our teams are doing to enhance customer value perception. International comparable sales decreased approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 4% was related to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The remaining 2% was the result of continued pressure across multiple markets, somewhat offset by a 1% positive comp performance from our U.K. franchisees. Total revenue for the fourth quarter were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago.\n\nAnd while the increase was largely driven by the additional week of operations in 2023 and the consolidation of the U.K. restaurants, we don't want to lose sight of our positive North America comp sales, which also contributed to our revenue growth in the quarter. Now turning to profits. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $47 million, up from $38 million a year ago. The key drivers of our fourth quarter growth include a roughly $8 million benefit from the extra week of operations in 2023, an approximate $6 million increase from our domestic company-owned restaurants, driven by higher sales, lower commodity and labor costs, lower insurance expense related to improving auto and workers' compensation claims experience, leveraging the on-demand labor that aggregators provide through their delivery as a service model and a continued focus on cost discipline while still pursuing strategic growth initiatives.\n\nThis growth was partially offset by an approximate $5 million year-over-year impact related to our U.K. acquisition when taking into consideration a fourth quarter 2023 operating loss and a fourth quarter 2022 franchise royalty fees. Higher G&A expenses, as anticipated due to higher performance-based compensation expense when compared with the fourth quarter last year and higher D&A expense as we continue to invest in our restaurants and our technology support, along with the consolidation of the acquired U.K. restaurants in 2023. Adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 8.3%, up from 7.3% a year ago, largely due to the additional week in 2023. Excluding the additional week, adjusted operating margin was up approximately 20 basis points compared with last year.\n\nTo provide you a little bit more color on our fourth quarter domestic company-owned restaurant level margins. Overall, these margins improved by approximately 330 basis points compared with the prior year fourth quarter when excluding the 53rd week of operations. Driving the improved margin was approximately 170 basis point benefit from lower food basket costs as we continued to see relief from prior year peaks in proteins, cheese and dough [ph] Labor costs also improved by approximately 90 basis points during the quarter as our restaurant teams continue to do an excellent job executing our service and productivity initiatives. Moving on to cash flow and our balance sheet. For fiscal year 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $193 million, up from $18 million a year ago.\n\nAfter deducting $77 million in capital expenditures for the development of new domestic restaurants and investments in technology innovation, we generated free cash flow of $116 million. This is up from $39 million generated in 2022, reflecting the positive flow-through of our overall business performance and higher crude expenses. We ended the year with ample liquidity, $277 million in cash and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and a gross leverage of 3.2 times. We also returned significant cash to our shareholders in 2023. In total, we repurchased 2.5 million shares or $210 million and paid $59 million in cash dividends. We have approximately $90 million remaining for repurchase under our current share repurchase authorization.\n\nOur capital structure provides us with substantial operating flexibility. We'll continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to managing our cash flows, creating shareholder value through a combination of organic growth investments, debt repayments, cash dividends and share repurchases. Turning to development. In the fourth quarter, we added 36 net new units in North America, bringing our total North America net new units in 2023 to 57, a more than 50% increase over last year's net new unit growth. We now have 3,433 North America restaurants, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our newly opened restaurants, and we will prioritize our North America development efforts. Internationally, we opened 53 net new units in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year international development to 151 net new units and our total international restaurant count to 2,473.\n\nNow to our outlook. As we look to 2024, we are well positioned to continue driving forward our long-term strategy, and we expect to deliver our fifth consecutive year of positive North America comp sales growth. However, a more cautious consumer is placing more pressure on transactions through our organic delivery channel even as our domestic third-party aggregator sales continue to accelerate. This has led to comps being down approximately 1% for the first 8 weeks of the quarter. As we've discussed today, we're excited about the work our teams are doing to leverage our robust consumer data platforms to influence our media, pricing and menu strategies. We continue to take a balanced approach in this environment, providing the right promotions to our value-oriented customers without risking the erosion of our brand or pricing integrity on our more premium offerings.\n\nWe have great confidence in our ability to accelerate North America comps in Q2 and the back half of the year. As such, we expect to deliver 2024 full year comps at the lower end of our long-term target of 2% to 4% growth. Internationally, I'm pleased to report that quarter-to-date, we have seen a moderate sequential improvement in international comps. Positive performance at our U.K. company-owned and franchised restaurants, along with solid sales in other international markets are offsetting the impact from the Middle East conflict. We are in a dynamic environment and continue to maintain a cautious outlook on international comps in 2024. As a reminder, our International segment is the smallest of our operating segments, generating approximately 12% of our adjusted operating income and approximately 7% of our total revenues in 2023.\n\nCurrently, we anticipate adjusted operating income in 2024 to be between $153 million and $163 million. At the midpoint, this is an approximate 6% increase from 2023 when excluding the favorable impact of the 53rd week. Year-over-year tailwinds include the increase to our fixed commissary margin, our international transformation initiatives, including the closure of approximately 50 underperforming company-owned U.K. restaurants in the second quarter and an increase in North America sales as we accelerate development and deliver another year of positive comp sales. Offsetting these tailwinds will be higher G&A expenses as performance-based compensation ramps back up and a higher G&A expense, which is expected to be between $70 million and $75 million in 2024, resulting from the higher tech investments over the last 3 years.\n\nIn terms of other nonoperating expense items, we expect net interest expense to be between $40 million and $45 million, our capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million and our tax rate to be between 23% and 26%. I should note that our first quarter tax rate will be higher due to an anticipated shortfall from the vesting of long-term equity plans, resulting in an additional tax expense of roughly $2 million in the quarter when compared with the prior year period. From a development perspective, the North American market is the most attractive development for Papa John's, and we remain committed to accelerating our domestic footprint moving forward. In 2024, we expect net new unit growth for North America to increase more than 20% relative to 2023 net unit openings.\n\nFrom an international perspective, over the last 2 years, conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East, combined with an overall dynamic geopolitical environment has changed our run rate of new international restaurant openings for 2024. As a result, we are taking a cautious approach and expect growth openings between 100 and 140 new international restaurants. We will also not hesitate to make additional strategic restaurant closures to improve marketplace health or exit unprofitable restaurants. As such, our anticipated openings could be offset by the closure of underperforming company-owned and franchised restaurants to enhance long-term profitability. Over the long term, we have great partners who want to grow and are committed to reaching our long-term development targets of 5% to 7% net new units annually.\n\nIn summary, the Pope John's team has delivered a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. We're focused on executing our long-term growth strategy and implementing our Back to Better 2.0 and international transformation initiatives. I'm proud of the Papa John's team and our strategic plans to deliver growth. Now I'll turn the call back over to Rob for some final comments. Rob?\n\nRob Lynch: Thank you, Ravi. At Papa John's commitment to our values is top of mind, and we are steadfast in creating and nurturing a culture of putting people first. Capping off an incredible year we were recognized by Forbes on their list of world's best employers for the second year running, while also included in the Forbes list of Best Employers for Diversity, ranking first among pizza companies. As we continue to advance our strategic priority of building a culture of leaders who believe in diversity, inclusivity and winning, we will continue to support our communities, team members and franchisees. I am incredibly proud of the work that the entire Papa John's system is doing to drive forward our strategic long-term plan.\n\nOur North America business is prime for growth as we execute on our Back to Better 2.0 initiatives. We are continuing to expand our share within the domestic third-party aggregator delivery channel. We are introducing new menu innovations, and we are optimizing our profitability by leveraging our robust consumer data platforms. Additionally, our improving supply chain productivity and accelerating North America development will deliver improved bottom line economics systemwide. In summary, Papa John's has proven that its business fundamentals performed well through all economic cycles. Our leadership team has the experience and vision required to move our company forward and drive results. Our brand equity is stronger than ever, and our brand awareness continues to grow globally.\n\nWe have ample development opportunities to drive sustainable, profitable expansion and significant earnings potential. All this means that we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value for the long term. At this point, I would like to open up the call for questions.\n\nSee also 11 Best Brewery and Distillery Stocks to Buy Now and 13 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

Rob?\n\nStory continues\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nThank you, Stacy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before we get into our 2023 results and our 2024 strategic initiatives.\r\nI'd like to take a moment to briefly reflect on the progress that we've made over the last five years when I joined Papa John's in 2019, system-wide sales, North America units and operating income were rapidly declining. Since then, our team and franchisees have worked incredibly hard to rebuild the brand and regain consumer loyalty. Our focus and diligence during some of the most dynamic times in our industry has strengthened Papa John's and positioned us for sustainable growth in the QSR space to our team members and franchisees. Thank you for your commitment and dedication to our customers, our values and our brands. And we're playing a key role in our success because of these efforts today, we are reporting another year of record global systemwide sales, our fourth consecutive year of positive North America comps, accelerating North America unit growth and adjusted operating income with a five-year kegger of approximately 12%. More importantly, we made foundational improvements to our restaurant operations, grew our global restaurant footprint, improved our menu with innovative new products and advanced our digital and marketing platforms to support the evolution of our business model for our next chapter of growth. Our product innovation rooted in our brand promise of better ingredients, better pizza continues to be at the heart of our success. And 2023, we expanded some of our most popular platforms with the garlic Epic Stuffed Crust Pizza to reduce Cool Ranch pop ideas and new Papa bites, including Oreo and took flavors. We also introduced new innovations like our crispy parm pizza, becoming the first large pizza chain to put cheese on the bottom of the crust and brought back fan favorites like our chaperone a pizza. We also executed on our back to better 1.0 initiatives driving operational improvements to deliver better pizza with better service at our company-owned restaurants. We've reduced our out-the-door times nearly 25% to average under 20 minutes today, and we've seen our overall customer satisfaction scores continue to improve.\r\nThis great work has earned us the number one ranking in customer service for the pizza category on the American Customer Satisfaction Index in 2023 we also continue to lean into our domestic third-party aggregator partnerships as sales through this channel reached another high in the fourth quarter, growing more than 10% sequentially and up more than 50% from a year ago. As we've mentioned on past calls, there continues to be a lot of room for category expansion in this channel. We have seen that new competitors entering the marketplace does not necessarily lead to significant volume loss for a brand like ours that has been thriving in this space for years. Our quarter to date trends have continued to increase relative to our fourth quarter run rate, and we have increased our market share in this channel. In early January, we announced back to better. 2.0. These initiatives are designed to drive best-in-class pizza QSR unit economics through higher sales, higher restaurant-level margins and higher return on investment on new domestic restaurant openings, our largest and most profitable markets as part of our efforts to enhance our domestic national marketing investment and effectiveness. We went through an extensive advertising and media review process aimed at sharpening our analytics and formed approach to marketing and consolidating and optimizing our partners at the national level to drive scale.\r\nAs a result of this process, we have shifted to a more productive nationally focused marketing model we are increasing the per store investment in the national marketing fund from 5% to 6% of sales beginning in the second quarter of 2024, while eliminating the 3% required local spend. The required marketing contribution rate decreases from 8% to 6% and brings the added benefit of an immediate 200 basis points of margin at the restaurant level, along with a bigger impact from their marketing spend. I am thankful for the overwhelming support we receive from our franchisees on this change more than 90% of the system voted in favor highlighting the confidence our franchisees have in our go-forward marketing strategy. This includes improved audience selection, improved return on ad spend, sustained loyalty and increased cultural buzz our new partners are ramping quickly, and we look forward to sharing how our marketing programs are evolving on future calls. Additionally, we are optimizing our investments in data science and marketing technology to enhance our consumer value perception driven by occasion daypart and brand. Part of our success in driving positive sales over the past several years has been our ability to strike the right balance between ticket and transaction growth. This is accomplished through our barbell strategy that offers premium innovation while delivering on the needs of our value customers. We're focused on delivering value in every segment of our business, whether that is through promoted price points, our core menu, our premium innovation, moving to unit development and how we are incentivizing our franchisees to grow. In November, we launched a new development incentive to improve the return on capital investment of new domestic restaurants by waiving national marketing fund contributions for the first five years. This equates to 600 basis points of annual cost savings in their restaurant.\r\nP&L's for the first five years were an approximately $360,000 total benefit that will significantly improve the cash-on-cash payback for our developing franchisees who will be new units in 2024. This incentive will now extend into 2025 offering three years of national marketing fund relief or an approximately $216,000 average benefit for new units opened in 2025. Currently in North America, we have more than 100 units in our pipeline at various stages of developed. We are confident that this incentive program, which delivers best in class cash-on-cash returns, coupled with improved restaurant margins, customer service levels, marketing efficiencies and technology and analytics platforms will drive sustained development momentum for Papa John's, given the business model changes associated with back to better 2.0, these restaurants built in 2024 have the potential to be some of the most profitable restaurants in our system. All of these strategic actions are designed to drive strong top line sales and more volume, which in turn makes our supply chain more productive. We are evolving our commissary business and increasing our fixed operating margin to drive profitable growth for our company, while improving supply chain productivity and delivering long-term cost savings for our system. For example, our franchisees can now earn annual incentive based rebates as they increase volume and open new restaurants. The incremental volume driven by increased marketing and additional development will reduce the shared supply chain costs across the system. We are excited about these initiatives and the value that they will create for Papa John's and for our North America franchisees, not only as they ramp up in 2024, but over the next several years.\r\nNow to our international business over the past 10 years, we have more than doubled our international footprint and now operate in 50 countries and territories as we pursue our next phase of international growth. We are evolving our business model to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our customers and franchisees ensure targeted investments in efficient resource management and better position our largest markets for long-term success beyond new unit development it's about sustainably and profitably growing all of our restaurants globally. This past year, we've made significant enhancements to our international organization and infrastructure. As part of these efforts, we established international regional hubs and key target regions, Asia Pacific, India and Latin America.\r\nThese hubs are led by experienced general managers who are partnering with franchisees to create holistic strategies to drive profitable sales in their markets. Our teams are now aligned to the corporate and local levels to execute global best practices and operations, marketing and technology to accomplish our long-term objective of increasing market share in key markets around the world to support our international teams and franchisees. We are investing in consumer-facing technology, digital infrastructure and enhanced financial and operational reporting by investing in expanded ordering capabilities through our website and app and leveraging analytics, we expect to improve conversion, increased customer retention and deliver faster consumer insights to franchisees. This playbook is similar to what we successfully implemented within the US over the past few years, and we expect it to be equally successful as we expand this investment strip strategy globally.\r\nWe are also making progress on our repositioning efforts within the UK market and expect to improve and profitability during 2024 and 2023, we supported the transition of 61 underperforming UK franchised restaurants to other more proven UK franchisees. We have seen a significant improvement in the performance of these locations with their fourth quarter comp sales finishing well ahead of the other restaurants within the UK market. In fact, the fourth quarter was the second consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for our UK franchisees.\r\nIf you'll recall, in June, we announced the transition of 118 UK franchise restaurants to company ownership. As anticipated, these new company-owned UK restaurants were dilutive to 2023, adjusted operating income by approximately $9 million, which takes into consideration the restaurant's current year operating loss and the foregone prior year royalties similar to the other UK restaurants that transitioned to new owners. We are seeing sequential improvements in the performance of our company-owned restaurants together, our Company-owned restaurants and franchise locations in the UK are reporting positive comps to start 2024, and we continue to explore options to maximize the value and cash flow of our UK portfolio, ensuring alignment of the region and its performance with our long-term strategy.\r\nWe have also made the decision to close approximately 50 underperforming company-owned restaurants in the second quarter of 2024. These restaurants accounted for roughly two thirds of our operating loss in the UK in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate our remaining portfolio as well as our franchisee locations, focusing on sales trends, overall profitability and their lease and loan obligations. Through this process, additional strategic closures could occur as we look to drive improved profitability for our remaining stores, Optimiz trade zones and strengthening our franchisee base within this important market.\r\nIn this dynamic global environment, our industry is facing challenges from the potential impact of geopolitical events. We are closely monitoring these situations, and we'll maintain flexibility with our operations in those impacted regions. We are committed to our international transformational initiatives as we believe they best position us to realize our next phase of global growth and set our largest markets up for long-term success.\r\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi to cover the financial portion of today's call. Ravi?\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. To start, I'd like to echo Rob's sentiments and thank the entire Papa John's system for their focus and commitment to driving forward our strategic priorities during this past year towards our ambition to become the QSR brand of choice for consumers and franchisees around the world.\r\nNow for a closer look at our fourth quarter financial results. Global system-wide restaurant sales were $1.34 billion, up 11% in constant currency from the prior year fourth quarter. The increase was largely attributable to the shift in our 2023 fiscal calendar to include a 14th week in the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately nine percentage points of growth outside of the extra week. Global system-wide sales were up approximately 2% in the quarter, driven by new restaurant openings and higher North America comparable sales. Our 2% increase in North America. Comp sales was the result of increases in transactions and ticket growth for both our domestic Company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants. We continue to see higher transactions driven by our aggregator channel. While our ticket growth is supported by the work our teams are doing to enhance customer value perception.\r\nInternational comparable sales decreased approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 4% was related to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The remaining 2% was the rubble zone of continued pressure across multiple markets. Somewhat offset by a 1% positive comp performance from our UK franchisees.\r\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago. And while the increase was largely driven by the additional week of operations in 2023 and the consolidation of the UK restaurants, we don't want to lose sight of our positive North America comp sales, which also contributed to our revenue growth in the quarter.\r\nNow turning to profits. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $47 million up from $38 million a year ago. The key drivers of our fourth quarter growth include a roughly $8 million benefit from the extra week of operations in 2023, an approximate $6 million increase from our domestic company-owned restaurants, driven by higher sales, lower commodity and labor costs, lower insurance expense related to improving auto and workers' compensation claims experience, leveraging the on-demand labor that aggregators provide through their delivery as a service model and a continued focus on cost discipline while still pursuing strategic growth initiatives.\r\nThis growth was partially offset by an approximately $5 million year-over-year impact related to our UK acquisition. When taking into consideration a fourth quarter 2023 operating loss and a fourth quarter of 2022 franchise royalty fees, higher G&A expenses as anticipated due to higher performance-based compensation expense when compared with the fourth quarter last year and higher G&A expense as we continue to invest in our restaurants and our technology support, along with the consolidation of the acquired UK restaurants in 2023.\r\nAdjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 8.3%, up from 7.3% a year ago, largely due to the additional week in 2023. Excluding the additional week, adjusted operating margin was up approximately 20 basis points compared with last year. To provide you a little bit more color on our fourth quarter domestic company-owned restaurant level margins. Overall, these margins improved by approximately 330 basis points compared with the prior year fourth quarter, when excluding the 53rd week of operation driving the improved margin was approximately 170 basis point benefit from lower food basket costs as we continued to see relief from prior year peaks and proteins. Cheese and deli labor costs also improved by approximately 90 basis points during the quarter as our restaurant teams continue to do an excellent job executing our service and productivity initiatives.\r\nMoving onto cash flow and our balance sheet. For fiscal year 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $193 million, up from $118 million a year ago after deducting $77 million in capital expenditures for the development of new domestic restaurants and investments in technology innovation, we generated free cash flow of $116 million. This is up from $39 million generated in 2022 reflecting the positive flow-through of our overall business performance and higher accrued expenses.\r\nWe ended the year with ample liquidity $277 million in cash and borrowing available under our revolving credit facility and a gross leverage of 3.2 times. We also returned significant cash to our shareholders in 2023. In total, we repurchased 2.5 million shares or $210 million and paid $59 million in cash dividends. We have approximately $90 million remaining for repurchase under our current share repurchase authorization our capital structure provides us with substantial operating flexibility will continue to take a disciplined and balanced approach to managing our cash flows, creating shareholder value through a combination of organic growth investments, debt repayments, cash dividends and share repurchase?\r\nYes, turning to development, in the fourth quarter, we added 36 net new units in North America, bringing our total North America net new units in 2023 to 57 at more than 50% increase over last year's net new unit growth. We now have 3,433 North America restaurants, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our newly opened restaurants, and we will prioritize our North America development efforts. Internationally, we opened 53 net new units in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year international development to 151 net new units and our total international restaurant count to 2,473.\r\nNow to our outlook. As we look to 2024, we are well positioned to continue driving forward our long-term strategy, and we expect to deliver our fifth consecutive year of positive North America comp sales growth. However, a more cautious consumer is placing more pressure on transactions through our organic delivery channel, even as our domestic third-party aggregator sales continue to accelerate.\r\nThis has led to comps being down approximately 1% for the first eight weeks of the quarter. As we've discussed today, we're excited about the work our teams are doing to leverage our robust consumer data platforms to influence our media pricing and menu strategies. We continue to take a balanced approach in this environment, providing the right promotions to our value-oriented customers without risking the erosion of our brand, our pricing integrity on our more premium offerings. We have great confidence in our ability to accelerate North America comps in Q2 in the back half of the year.\r\nAs such, we expect to deliver 2024 full year comps at the lower end of our long-term target of 2% to 4% growth. Internationally, I'm pleased to report that quarter to date we have seen a moderate sequential improvement in international comps, positive performance at our UK company owned and franchised restaurants, along with solid sales in other international markets, offsetting the impact from the Middle East conflict. We are in a dynamic environment and continuing to maintain a cautious outlook on international comps in 2024.\r\nAs a reminder, our International segment is the smallest of our operating segments, generating approximately 12% of our adjusted operating income and approximately 7% of our total revenues in 2023. Currently, we anticipate adjusted operating income in 2024 to be between $153 million and $163 million at the midpoint, this is an approximate 6% increase from 2023 when excluding the favorable impact of the 53rd week year-over-year tailwinds include the increase to our fixed commissary margin our international transformation initiatives, including the closure of approximately 50 underperforming company-owned UK restaurants in the second quarter and an increase in North America sales as we accelerate development and deliver another year of positive comp sales. Offsetting these tailwinds will be higher G&A expenses as performance-based compensation ramps back up and higher D&A expense, which is expected to be between $70 million and $75 million in 2024, resulting from the higher tech investments over the last three years.\r\nIn terms of other nonoperating expense items, we expect net interest expense to be between $40 million and $45 million. Our capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $85 million, and our tax rate to be between 23% and 26%. I should note that our first quarter tax rate will be higher due to an anticipated shortfall from the vesting of long-term equity plans, resulting in an additional tax expense of roughly $2 million in the quarter when compared with the prior year period.\r\nFrom a development perspective, the North American market is the most attractive development for Papa John's and we remain committed to accelerating our domestic footprint moving forward.\r\nIn 2024, we expect net new unit growth for North America to increase more than 20% relative to 2023 net unit openings from an international perspective over the last two years, conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East, combined with an overall dynamic geopolitical environment, has changed our run rate of new international restaurant openings for 2024. As a result, we are taking a cautious approach and expect gross openings between 100 and 140 new international restaurants. We will also not hesitate to make additional strategic restaurant closures to improve marketplace health or exit unprofitable restaurants. As such, our anticipated openings could be offset by the closure of underperforming company-owned and franchised restaurants to enhance long-term profitability over the long term. We have great partners who want to grow and are committed to reaching our long-term development target of 5% to 7% net new units annually.\r\nIn summary, the Papa John's team has delivered a solid fourth quarter and full year 2023. We are focused on executing our long-term growth strategy and implementing our back to better 2.0 and international transformation initiatives. I'm proud of the Papa John's teams and our strategic plans to deliver growth now I'll turn the call back over to Rob for some final comments. Rob?\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nThank you, Ravi. At Papa John's commitment to our values is top of mind and we are steadfast in creating and nurturing a culture of putting people first, capping off an incredible year. We were recognized by Forbes on their list of World's Best Employers for the 2nd year, running while also included in the Forbes list of Best Employers for Diversity ranking first among pizza companies, as we continue to advance our strategic priority of building a culture of leaders who believe in diversity, inclusivity and winning. We will continue to support our communities team members and franchisees. I am incredibly proud of the work that the entire Papa John's system is doing to drive forward our strategic long term plan. Our North America business is primed for growth as we execute on our back to better 2.0 initiatives. We are continuing to expand our share within the domestic third-party aggregator delivery channel. We are introducing new menu innovations, and we are optimizing our profitability by leveraging our robust consumer data platform. Additionally, our improving supply chain productivity and accelerating North America development will deliver improved bottom line economics system-wide.\r\nIn summary, Papa John's has proven that its business fundamentals perform well through all economic cycles. Our leadership team has the experience and vision required to move our Company forward and drive results. Our brand equity is stronger than ever, and our brand awareness continues to grow globally. We have ample development opportunities to drive sustainable, profitable expansion and significant earnings potential. All this means that we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value for the long term.\r\nAt this point I would like to open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\r\nSara Senatore, Bank of America.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nAnd I just had a quick clarification and then a question on you mentioned that aggregator sales, it grew more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter. And I think given what you said about quarter to date in the first quarter, it sounds like that gap remains pretty wide but with your proprietary channel, I think you are sort of suggesting that it's our response may be to more promotional intensity in that that might be affecting the proprietary channels and perhaps less so to the aggregator. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. And then the question was about international unit growth. And to what extent is the Middle East, the primary driver, I think the relatively small share of your total international store base versus and perhaps what you're seeing in other markets and the extent to which those are more market-specific? Thanks.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nThanks, Sarah. So what I would tell you is that and I think we stated this in the past that about right now, the aggregator channels, we believe to be about 50% incremental to our core channels. So um, you know, 50% of that growth would be coming from our core business. Obviously, we have initiatives in place to mitigate and that the any of that shift in volume from our core business to the aggregator. So it's not a one for one transfer, but 50% of the aggregator volume comes from our core channels. And in regards to the Middle East, the Middle East has actually become a bigger part of our international footprint. We have about 2,400 units internationally and the Middle East represents about 400 of 450 of those units. So it's become about 25%, I'm sorry, about 20% of our international footprint.\r\nAnd so it is one of our fastest growing developing regions. And so we did see a pretty significant impact in Q4 to our global development number and that did definitely impact that number. In 2023, we had 68 new units and in that region in 2022 alone. So it is something we're watching closely we have great franchisees there and they have built and been excited about building and it have rapidly grown their development agreements in the region. So it is something we're watching closely and we'll have a we'll have a short term impact as it is called out in the call, Tom, on the on the 2024 numbers.\n\nSara Senatore\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you once on our next question.\r\nPeter Saleh, BTIG.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nYes, great. Thanks. So I was hoping maybe you guys could elaborate a little bit on the on the same-store sales trends that you're currently seeing. It seems like you guys ended the year on a positive note, but starting the year on a negative note, but we're also seeing some strength in that aggregator channel. So I mean, maybe just come back a little bit more to Sara's question. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the same-store sales and maybe what's changed quarter to date?\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nYes. I mean, I think I think the consumer has changed a little bit. I think we're seeing some softness in general in the industry, particularly in January. We have seen some strength in February. We were the number three brand ordered on UberEATS for the Super Bowl on. So, you know, despite some challenging goals situations in January, we've seen some some resiliency. But what I will tell you, Peter, is we always knew that Q1 was going to be our toughest quarter coming into this year. All of the things, all the plans that we have built to deliver strong comp sales growth this year really take effect in Q2. So we're about four weeks away from a 20% increase in media, a new advertising campaign hitting. And we've got great new innovation coming in April as well so in those those impacts are going to sustain through the balance of the year. So we are really excited about Q2 three and four because of all the back, the better 2.0, some things that we announced back in January. So we definitely see strong sales momentum Looking forward, despite a little bit of a soft start here in January, thank you.\n\nPeter Saleh\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Lauren Silberman from Glimcher Deutsch from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nStacy Frole\n\nThank you very much. And I wanted to ask about the reason we announced new development incentives in the US. Can you just talk about your early conversations with franchisees, any inflection and inquiries commitments for Agile? You're trying to pull forward openings into 2024. Thank you very much.\r\nYes, there's definitely a lot of excitement. We've had a lot of conversations, you know, last year in 2023, we delivered 57 net new units in North America. We're going to grow that by at least 20% in 2024, but we're working diligently with our franchisees to help them accelerate. That being said, we also have extended that development incentive into 2025. At this point, it's not exactly the same. The if they get them built in 2024. It's five years of national marketing fund relief if they get them built in 2025, three years of relief. So we wanted to make sure that all of the franchisees that are coming to us saying, hey, I want to take advantage of this, but, you know, I'm not far enough into the development cycle that these stores might move into Q1 next year, wanted to make sure that they had some incentive to do that. So we're definitely seeing excitement or definitely leveraging that incentive. But I will I will tell you beyond the incentives now, Papa John's is set up for long-term development growth. It's not just 24 and 25, and we're really trying to kickstart this this engine, but we have great returns on new store development. Our AUVs have gone up from 850,000 on average, 1.2 million over the last five years. So at the same time, we've been really good about managing in our restaurant profitability as evidenced by 330 basis points of year-over-year growth in our restaurant margins in Q4. So this incentive is definitely a trigger. But this isn't the reason why people are going to develop Papa John's, they're going to develop Papa John's because it's a long-term commitment 10, 20 year cycles of business that they believe will continue to deliver returns far into the future beyond these incentives.\r\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd Kim, next question coming from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nThanks.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nGood morning.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nYou've announced today that you will be closing 50 of the UK Company-operated units. At the same time you gave some positive commentary on trends in the U.K. sequentially improving trends, comps are positive to arguably a better UK outlook. Sorry, these restaurants are closing. Are they just in your mind kind of a lost cause? Or can you help us understand the decision to close these stores rather than continue to train and get the benefits that comes from turning them around?\r\nYes, for sure. Thank you for the question, Brian. The UK has been something that has been a bit of late, a labor of love over the last 18 months. We believe in the long-term viability of that market. We have great franchisees. We're running great operations, but we also have we've also had some stores that have not been operated as well. And so that's both in the company portfolio that we took over as well as in the franchisee base at large. So as we stated earlier, we have been working over the last year to get a lot of the restaurants that we see having long-term potential, but maybe not operated in the most effective way transition from their former franchisees to new franchisees that are in or current franchisees in the system that run better operations. And we've seen a lot of benefits for those restaurants and improvement both on the top and bottom line from those transitions the 50 restaurants that we're talking about closing our Company stores that we believe will not benefit simply from better operations. They have, as you know, locations where the trade zones have moved or other challenges that frankly will not be easily mitigated to get them to profitability. So we will still own about 68 restaurants in that market. Our objective is to continue to optimize that portfolio, which may include refranchising some of those restaurants to great franchisees, but the ones that we're closing, yes, exactly what you said, those are restaurants that aren't going to be able to get the profitability anytime soon and hence our decision to close those and say.\r\nThank you.\r\nThanks, Brian, Kim.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Your line is open, please.\r\nThanks.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nGood morning. I have a two-part question, if I may, and it's on the back of better 2.0 initiative you've made it clear that national advertising is significantly more efficient than regional or local. But I think there is some skepticism skepticism out there about the impact of going from 8% to 6%. So those two points that you're giving up on the local side, that's the first part.\r\nAnd the second part is your conversations with your franchisees. Do you get the sense that they're going to abandon the local marketing entirely, or do you think that the majority will keep spending at or near the prior year levels?\r\nI would think that in year one of the program where the commissary commission is just starting to be phased in at the higher rates that the majority of operators will continue to spend the local markets. Is there is there any way that you can maybe quantify the net effect of all that?\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nYes, great question, Bill.\r\nWhat I would say is that there's a lot more consistency on the returns on advertising spend at the national level than there are at the local level. You know, some franchisees were able to invest their local dollars in productive ways, a lot of franchisees were not using those dollars as productively and not necessarily because they chose not to adjust because the funds we're not at a scale where they could buy media in their markets that was as productive and efficient as we can buy at the national level. So when we look at the return on advertising spend and we're seeing over a 25% improvement at the national level versus the local level. So if you think about it, we net-net, as we were comparing apples to apples, we're reducing the total advertising investment by about 25%, and you're getting a 25% pickup on that. So that's why we think it's at least comparable. But then when you layer in the tools that we have just developed with our we brought on a new media partner who is working with us to develop better analytical tools that allow us to target more efficiently will allow us to deploy media more efficiently. All of that at the national level will become more effective in those ROIs that we have. We have evaluated in the past. So we have a lot of confidence that the spike going from eight to six, we're going to see significant input improvement and impact of that 6%.\r\nOn your second question or I will say the second part of the question, because we're only allowing one question, you know, so that's kind of the white label. Anyway said, we do believe that you know, France, some franchisees will continue to spend above that 6% level, especially in the first two years, primarily because they have entered into agreements with local sports teams in their markets that they are contractually obligated to continue with.\r\nBut I see some of our franchisees and frankly, some of our company markets that we own.\r\nWe will continue to spend at higher than 6% levels because of those partnerships. And I'll give an example here in Atlanta, we are partners with the Braves and the Hawks and we activate with them and we see great returns when we do that.\r\nSo we will continue to invest in those partnerships.\r\nAnd I think our franchisees who leverage those types of partnerships in their markets will continue to invest as well.\r\nThank you, sir.\r\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nThank you and just a follow-up on the on the UK business. As you go through this strategic restructuring process, which Rob, I think you said you might refranchise the remaining 68 company-owned stores but I'm just wondering what happens to the commissary business over there?\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nIs that something you want to continue to own longer term?\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nIs it important strategically for you to own it just any thoughts on that part of the business?\r\nIt is not important for us to strategically own it. If there is there are business models that we are exploring, that would look very different than the model that we employ today. We have been very happy with our ownership. There are teams who run the supply chain, do a great job and manage it very effectively and productively. So we're happy with that. But we're exploring every strategic option. And if we we have opportunities to create more productivity and drive more profitability with less risk. We will definitely explore those opportunities.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nThe closure of these restaurants.\r\nI just want to make it clear, the closure of these 50 restaurants will be immediately accretive to our income I mean, the usually when you close restaurants, it's a bad thing. You know that the royalty revenues go away or the EBITDA from the restaurants go away. These are all on you know, negative profit restaurants and we to Brian's question, we don't see them turning profitable in the foreseeable future. So these restaurants need to close. They're low volume. Obviously, if they're unprofitable. They're low volume restaurants. So the impact of the supply chain in the short term, we are we will not be as significant as closing, you know, a lot of profitable productive restaurants.\r\nThe other thing I just want to make clear, we do anticipate sales transfer. So by closing these restaurants, we actually make the other restaurants in the U.K. system from higher volume and more profitable. So there is there is a benefit to them to the balance of the system and some of that volume loss from closing these restaurants will be mitigated by that sales transfer to and the restaurants that remain.\r\nThank you.\r\nThank you, Brian.\r\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Todd Brooks with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, you highlighted at the start of your remarks this morning that on product innovation has been at the heart of the success that you've driven. And I know there's a lot of focus on back to better 2.0 as we're looking to 24. But can you talk to innovation pipeline. And if 24 setting up is more of an of a product line extension year on existing offerings or are this novel platforms or products coming down?\r\nThe line that you think could be needle movers as well?\r\nThanks.\r\nThank you.\r\nYes.\r\nSo when I think of Innovene, I'll speak to your specific question around product innovation. But when I think of innovation, I think about innovation across all of our demand driving capabilities. So product, loyalty marketing, we've already talked a lot about marketing and the advancements that we're making through our more efficient media capabilities and targeting capabilities on the innovation and our brand positioning as we launch our new campaign with the Martin Agency.\r\nAnother one I'll talk about is loyalty know, our loyalty program has been very effective for us. Over the last five years. We've gone from 12 members to over 30 to 12 million members to over 32 million members in five years, but it's not just the sheer number. It's the way we've leveraged the platform both to us and both to deliver incentives to our most valuable customers. But also to create I sense a hospitality with our brands to make sure that people feel special when they come to our organic channels. I mean, we do things like grant early access to our new product innovations in and, you know, give them access to Papa John's gear for our favor, fans and different surprise and delight things that we do for those loyalty members, we can get better at that. And we are currently working to drive some optimization into our loyalty platform to enhance both the hospitality component it provides, but and also the incentive component and how we manage our Papa does and the incentive. So there's a lot of innovation on the marketing side, the loyalty side on the product innovation side, we've been very innovative over the last three years. We've launched things like property as we launched things like Papa bites. It's been a challenge for us to really advertise those great things our customers tell us that they love it. But you know, in this business you have to make sure you're advertising pizza. Otherwise, you take a lot of check degradation. So we're going to get innovative even on how we promote our products. We are going to launch some, you know, in April with a new innovation that we will be sharing here shortly. But that innovation will be across multiple platforms that will be across pizza. It'll be across pop ideas and it will be across our base and we will advertise those holistically. So we're creating awareness of other products that we have to have less household penetration less attachment than our core pizza. So it's not even just the unique ingredients that we're creating innovation around. It's how we're promoting things, how we're driving our entire holistic menu to drive both drive our pizza business, but also drive our attachment. So yes, we do have new platforms coming. And we also have new ways in which we're going to advertise and create awareness of those platforms.\r\nRecruitments are up.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you in Kim and our next question coming from the line of Alexander Slagle with Jefferies.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nYour line is open airbags.\r\nGood morning.\r\nI just wanted to ask on the international development piece and the slowdown that you see in 24. And I know a lot of that has to do with specific and challenges in the UK and Middle East, but trying to think about how how quickly things could reaccelerate you know, into 25. I mean, obviously a lot of different scenarios for those markets. But are there other regions that you think could sort of an acceleration in growth to help sort of bring that that international gross development number back up over 200, but kind of where you had been or are you going to dissipate a longer period of time to get that back up? Just trying to get a sense for how quickly things can pivot back on that.\r\nSo great question, Alex. What I would tell you is that and I'll get to your specific question, but we are hyper focused in 2024 on our domestic development business. So when you ask about where the upside is to maybe close some of that gap. I'm hopeful that that upside is domestic. And I want to make I what make sure that we have been as transparent as possible and letting everyone know that one domestic restaurant opening is equivalent to four international openings.\r\nOkay? So we know our royalty rates internationally are typically lower because of our master franchisee agreements than they are domestically and our AUVs are about half the size on average. So this everything that we're doing right now around back to better 2.0 driving this development incentive, we've rebuilt our internal development team across construction, real estate administration. Every every facet of the development pipeline is really to get this to this domestic development engine rolling. And there will be a huge amount of value creation over the next five years from doing that.\r\nOkay. So I just want to make that point then to speak directly to your international question. There's really three markets that are impacting our openings over the next couple of years.\r\nOne is the UK. The UK has been a strong development market for us. We've been opening about 50 units a year in the UK for the last couple of years. The problem is those restaurants haven't always been best.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nRestaurants were hands.\r\nYou know why we're choosing to close some of them. We have moved away from a strategy of open restaurants at all costs and give franchisees the ability to open restaurants at all costs like we are making sure that the restaurants that are opening moving forward internationally are looked at with the same scrutiny that we have domestically.\r\nIf someone submits a site domestically, we go out and check the site make sure it's a good site.\r\nWe do all the analytics to make sure that this restaurant has the greatest chance and probability of success. We haven't been as disciplined internationally. So we are implementing those capabilities and that oversight, that's why we put three business units to build three business units in the regions where we want to grow to be able to give some of that infrastructure and support to these markets. So the UK, Russia and the Middle East are the three markets where we have been really successful at developing over the last five years and have been impacted over the last couple of years and more recently in the Middle East. So so those are the openings challenges, but this number that we put out today is really a function more of closures than it is a lack of openings. We are closing. We are strategically closing these 50 units that takes the number down from where our run rate right out of the gate. And then we're also working with franchisees to help them optimize their portfolio of ReSTOR.\r\nIf franchisees are spending resources running restaurants that are never going to be profitable.\r\nThat's taking away the resources from the restaurants that they should be focused on growing and building new restaurants that can perform better than the sub-optimized restaurants that are already operating. So we have baked in strategic closures globally into that number that we shared today. So once we get through that and that optimization of the global footprint. And assuming that some of the geopolitical macroeconomic situations change, we have every belief and confidence in our long term international growth rate and development.\r\nGreat.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nThanks for that.\r\nThanks.\r\nAlex and Kim.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a clarification. And then a question on the acceleration in or the increase in U.S. openings. Is that growth going to be back-half weighted given the timing of the incentives and build times and things like that. So that's just a clarification. And then my question is about the international transformation initiatives. You talked about the hubs, UK optimization. I'm just curious, what's next on the check list within that transformation? Or what are the next milestones kind of thinking maybe more from an operational perspective and then the footprint?\r\nGreat questions.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nI mean, development is always kind of back half-weighted.\r\nQ4 is always the biggest development quarter. So that is that's kind of the normal cycle of development. That being said, yes, I would expect that the upside potential of the development incentives that we've put out there would come to fruition later in the year, given the you know, if they're just starting some of these projects in Q1, it's going to take in a seven to nine months for those to come to fruition. So so yes, is the answer come on the international side know, building these these units. These are these teams. We still have markets internationally that don't have digital ordering. I mean that's that's you know that every market and every every restaurant, every market globally does not look like the Papa John's model that you see here in the US and there are markets that aren't necessary. Some markets use aggregators at scale, almost exclusively Some markets have really not yet tapped into the aggregator model. Some markets have not been leveraging product innovation that drive their business, some marketing. There's a lot of different things. These are hubs that we've built and APACEMEA. and Latin America will be will all have marketing technology and operational resources to guide their future path and drive not just new store development, but profit comp and profit growth in the stores that already exist. I mean, if we were able to use to increase the international AUVs, just to 75 or 80% of what we have in the US. I mean the amount of income grows for our franchisees and royalty growth for us would be worth two to three years of new store development. So we really fundamentally believe that we can help these franchisees significantly accelerate. They're comp and profit growth through the investments we're making in these regional hubs.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.\r\nGreat.\n\nRavi Thanawala\n\nThank you. Rob, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your comment on the consumer changing a bit as the calendar turned. And certainly we've heard this from others this earnings season, but can you highlight anything more on what that means and what you've observed with your customer, whether it's ordering or spending patterns? And more importantly on that, you talked to the barbell strategy, but can you speak a little more to your value efforts, maybe where value scores are and sort of how you're thinking about promos and value and what looks like an increasingly promotional category right now?\r\nNow it's a great. Great question, Dennis. And I think I think you nailed it, um, you know, we have seen across this industry and across retail and across a lot of industries just a little bit of consumer spending softness. I don't think it surprises any of us given, you know, where the credit cards are at and some of the other macroeconomic dynamics at play. That being said, I have continued to reinforce and it's based on historical data that that our segment of this industry is well positioned to come to persevere and grow through tough, challenging consumer and economic times. I mean, that's what we've seen in the past. We we being pizza offer an amazing value relative to the other segments of the industry, whether it's find it whether it's a dine-in or other QSR. And I would argue that the gap it has never been greater. I think that, you know, pizza in general has taken less pricing than a lot of the other QSR segments. And I think as we if we believe that there is going to be some consumer challenges over over the mid to long term pizza is going to benefit from it. And so we have definitely worked really hard to try to balance that barbell of premium and value heading into 2024 and as evidenced by right now, we're running a national promotion, which is eight 99 large one topping, which is the hottest deal we have run since I came to Papa John's. We've never done anything like that. And so we've got a competitive category. We've got competitors out there with more scale than we do, who had been very aggressive on promoted pricing. And so we were battling for transactions with them. And so we have to have a good value prop out there. And I've always said that we do given, you know, we've always had a low carryout special and other specials on our menu, but we've never nationally promoted them. So we've done that the last couple of weeks and to battle for those transactions, but we're not moving away from our strategy. I've always said we can't beat our competitors by trying to be our competitor. So we will continue to deliver premium innovation that, you know, balances out the other side of that barbell, while we continue to evaluate our need and desire to launch to Enno to fight for that value customer as well so I feel like we've got a balanced strategy moving forward. I feel like we've been very competitive in Q one. And like I said earlier in the call, the full force of back to better 2.0 marketing initiatives, new agency, new media, 20% increase in national investment all hits in Q2. So and that continues throughout the balance of the year. So I think we're going to be right there being able to continue to be very competitive in this marketplace as at regardless of what the macroeconomic environment looks like here and Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for question and answer session.\n\nOperator\n\nI'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Lynch for any closing.\n\nRobert Lynch\n\nWell, thanks, everyone.\r\nFor your time this morning and for your continued interest in Papa John's, I think as you can see, we have continued to persevere through some challenging international environments. We have shifted some of our focus to driving our very profitable and accretive domestic development. And we're very excited about the balance of 2024 and seeing the impact of the marketing and product initiatives that we have underway. So I look forward to speaking with you at our annual meeting of shareholders on May second and then sharing our first quarter 2024 results with you as well.\r\nI'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our team members and franchisees. They continue to show unbelievable resiliency and agility during these unique times. So thank you, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Papa John's (PZZA) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.73 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.71 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 24.66%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pizza chain would post earnings of $0.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering a surprise of -5.36%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nPapa John's , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $571.32 million for the quarter ended December 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $526.23 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nPapa John's shares have lost about 8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.3%.\n\nWhat's Next for Papa John's?\n\nWhile Papa John's has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Papa John's: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.69 on $554.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.79 on $2.22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

        "content": "Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) Reports Sales Below Analyst Estimates In Q4 Earnings\n\nFast-food pizza chain Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) fell short of analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 8.6% year on year to $571.3 million. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.91 per share, improving from its profit of $0.71 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Papa John's? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nPapa John's (PZZA) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $571.3 million vs analyst estimates of $578.2 million (1.2% miss) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.91 vs analyst estimates of $0.72 (26.6% beat) Free Cash Flow of $40.4 million, up 137% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 30.4%, up from 29.9% in the same quarter last year Same-Store Sales were up 0.1% year on year Store Locations: 5,906 at quarter end, increasing by 200 over the last 12 months Market Capitalization: $2.30 billion\n\n\u201cPapa Johns finished 2023 with a solid fourth quarter and achieved record system-wide sales for the year, marking this as our fourth consecutive year of positive North America comparable restaurant sales,\u201d said Rob Lynch, Papa Johns President and CEO.\n\nFounded by the eclectic John \u201cPapa John\u201d Schnatter, Papa John\u2019s (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a globally recognized pizza delivery and carryout chain known for \u201cbetter ingredients\u201d and \u201cbetter pizza\u201d.\n\nTraditional Fast Food\n\nTraditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness.\n\nSales Growth\n\nPapa John's is larger than most restaurant chains and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge over its smaller competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 7.2% over the last four years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was decent as it opened new restaurants and expanded its reach. Papa John's Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, Papa John's revenue grew 8.6% year on year to $571.3 million, missing Wall Street's expectations. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 3.8% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.\n\nSame-Store Sales\n\nSame-store sales growth is an important metric that tracks organic growth and demand for a restaurant's established locations.\n\nPapa John's demand has been shrinking over the last eight quarters, and on average, its same-store sales have declined by 0.4% year on year. This performance isn't ideal and the company should reconsider its growth strategy before opening new restaurants with its precious capital. Papa John's Year On Year Same Store Sales Growth\n\nIn the latest quarter, Papa John's year on year same-store sales were flat. This performance was more or less in line with the same quarter last year.\n\nKey Takeaways from Papa John's Q4 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how Papa John's beat analysts' gross margin expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EPS outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its revenue unfortunately missed analysts' expectations. No guidance was given in the earnings release. Overall, we think this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders. The stock is flat after reporting and currently trades at $69.8 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Papa John's right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates five times over the last two years.\n\nLooking at Papa John's's peers in the traditional fast food segment, some of them have already reported Q4 earnings results, giving us a hint of what we can expect. Jack in the Box's revenues decreased 7.5% year on year, beating analyst estimates by 1.2% and Portillo's reported revenues up 24.5% year on year, exceeding estimates by 2%. Jack in the Box traded flat on the results, and Portillo's was up 9%.\n\nRead our full analysis of Jack in the Box's results here and Portillo's's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the traditional fast food segment, with the stocks up on average 2.3% over the last month. Papa John's is down 4.4% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $80.7, compared to share price of $72.6.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right.

        "content": "Papa John's International, Inc. PZZA is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 29, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, its earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.4%.\n\nQ4 Estimates\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, suggesting growth of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter. Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates have remained stable. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $578.9 million, suggesting growth of 10% from the prior-year reported figure.\n\nFactors to Note\n\nPapa John's fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results are likely to be aided by expansion efforts, sales building initiatives and digitalization. Robust North America comparable sales are likely to have driven the top line.\r\n\r\nPapa John\u2019s is making substantial investments in technology-focused strategies, mainly digital ordering, to drive sales. Their online and digital marketing efforts have notably expanded in recent years, responding to the rising utilization of online and mobile web technology.

We project North America commissary revenues and North America franchise royalties & fees to rise 3.6% and 11.4% from the year-earlier actuals, respectively.\n\nPreliminary Results\n\nLast month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2023 preliminary results. In the fourth quarter ending Dec 31, 2023, global system-wide sales totaled nearly $1.3 billion, reflecting a 12% increase year over year. Excluding the 53rd week in 2023, sales growth for the quarter came in at 3%.\r\n\r\nIn North America, comparable sales (on a 13-week basis) for the fourth quarter of 2023 rose 2% year over year. The upside was driven by transaction and ticket growth at both Domestic Company-owned restaurants and North America franchised restaurants. In 2023, North America comparable sales (on a 52-week basis) were up 1% year over year, courtesy of 3% growth at Domestic Company-owned restaurants. International comparable sales for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 were down 6% and 4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nPapa John's International, Inc.

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to look at the 15 Highest Quality Pizza Chains in America. If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the Pizza Food Chain industry, you can go directly to 5 Highest Quality Pizza Chains in America.\n\nThe global pizza market has experienced significant growth in recent years. In 2023, the market size reached US$ 148.6 Billion, and it is projected to expand to US$ 222.5 Billion by 2032, with a growth rate of 4.45% during 2024-2032, according to IMARC Group. This growth is driven by various factors, including changing consumer dietary preferences towards healthier options like low-calorie, vegan, and gluten-free pizzas, as well as the increasing popularity of online pizza ordering through web portals and mobile apps.\n\nOver time, pizza has become a staple food in many cultures, available in various forms such as pizzerias, restaurants, frozen meals, and prepackaged options at grocery stores. It is enjoyed as a quick meal, ordered for delivery, or served at social events and gatherings. The market is particularly thriving in developing economies due to rapid westernization and the adoption of advanced technologies like customer preference tracking analytics, robotic automation, and integrated delivery systems. Furthermore, the globalization and cultural integration of cuisines have introduced a wide range of international flavors to different parts of the world. In total, there are more than 245,000 pizza restaurants globally, with around 77,000 located in the United States alone.\n\nNotably, Gennaro Lombardi is credited with opening the first pizzeria in the U.S. in 1905. Among the three largest pizza chains in the U.S. now, Pizza Hut, founded in 1958 in Wichita, Kansas, is the oldest, followed by Domino\u2019s, established in 1960 in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and Papa John\u2019s, founded in 1984 in Jeffersonville, Indiana, just outside of Louisville. Interestingly, Domino's boasts a menu with 34 million possible pizza combinations, with over 70% of its orders coming through digital channels. It is also worth noting that the largest pizza chains in the world are American.\n\nStory continues\n\nPizza restaurants play a significant role in the American restaurant industry. Offering options for dining in, takeout, and delivery, these establishments have seen a steady increase in sales over the past decade. In 2022, sales from pizza restaurants in the U.S. reached a record high of 46.9 billion U.S. dollars, marking a growth of approximately ten billion U.S. dollars compared to the previous decade. Additionally, the number of pizza restaurants in the U.S. has been steadily rising, with an increase of around seven thousand units over the last eight years, totaling more than 80 thousand units in 2022. Notably, in the same year, sales from chain pizza restaurants in the U.S. surpassed those of independent pizza restaurants by over seven billion U.S. dollars.\n\nThere are more than 70,000 pizza restaurants in the U.S. alone, couple of which we are going to discuss just now, which are also operating on the global scale.\n\nMajor Pizza Chains in the World\n\nPapa John's International, Inc.

        "content": "Papa John's International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. In other words, investors can purchase Papa John's International's shares before the 9th of February in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of February.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.46 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.84 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Papa John's International has a trailing yield of 2.5% on the current share price of US$74.06. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Papa John's International has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Papa John's International\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Papa John's International is paying out an acceptable 73% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (67%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that Papa John's International's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nStory continues\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. historic-dividend\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's not ideal to see Papa John's International's earnings per share have been shrinking at 3.3% a year over the previous five years.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Papa John's International has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHas Papa John's International got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? While earnings per share are shrinking, it's encouraging to see that at least Papa John's International's dividend appears sustainable, with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Papa John's International.\n\nWith that in mind though, if the poor dividend characteristics of Papa John's International don't faze you, it's worth being mindful of the risks involved with this business. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Papa John's International you should be aware of.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.
