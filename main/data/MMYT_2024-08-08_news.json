        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 July 31, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses GoDaddy GDDY, MakeMyTrip MMYT, QuinStreet QNST and Asure Software ASUR.\n\nIndustry: Internet Delivery\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2311538/4-internet-delivery-services-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-challenges\n\nPersistent macroeconomic uncertainties, protracted inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates are challenges for many players within the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry. Moreover, elevated operating expenses related to hiring new employees, and sales and marketing strategies to capture more market share are likely to strain margins in the near term. Additionally, as expansion into newer markets will take some time to generate volumes, higher upfront costs might erode profitability.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry participants like GoDaddy, MakeMyTrip, QuinStreet and Asure Software are strategically positioned for growth due to their sustained efforts toward adopting changing consumer preferences. A greater Internet presence in emerging markets, a burgeoning affluent middle class and the accelerated uptake of smartphones are set to aid Internet \u2013 Delivery Services industry participants. Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry primarily comprises companies that offer services via Internet-based platforms. These include food delivery, online travel booking, direct marketing and media services and web hosting, among others. Some companies in this space offer Internet domain registration and web hosting registration and sell e-business-related software and services.\n\nA few industry participants provide air and train ticket bookings, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, bus tickets and car hire services. Some players offer online direct marketing and media services, including online messaging, email broadcasting, search engine marketing and brand management facilities. Growth-stage companies in the industry are spending more on R&D and sales & marketing, making it difficult for them to generate profits in the near term.\n\nTrends Shaping the Future of the Internet - Delivery Services Industry\n\nSmartphones & Internet Penetration Act as Key Catalysts: The Internet is ubiquitous, and the heightening usage of smartphones is changing the delivery landscape. The companies in the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry are benefiting from the growing number of Internet users, coupled with an improvement in Internet penetration and the rapid adoption of the 4G Volte technology. The emergence of 5G technology, which promises faster speed and deliverability, also bodes well for this industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting Consumer Preferences: The shift in consumer preferences, driven by convenience and easy accessibility, is anticipated to aid the industry. The accelerated transition from offline to online food ordering, as well as the rising penetration of online travel booking, augurs well for industry players. However, as the higher consumer spending appetite is the main driver of the overall industry\u2019s health, any sluggishness in the global economy will pose a risk.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Advances in technology, including route optimization algorithms, GPS tracking and real-time delivery updates, have enhanced the efficiency and reliability of Internet delivery services. These technological innovations improve delivery accuracy and reduce transit times.\n\nHigher Upfront Costs to Hurt Profitability: Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth. However, higher upfront costs related to expansion strategies might erode profitability. Moreover, Amazon\u2019s focus on strengthening its delivery system is a key challenge for the industry players.\n\nWe believe the company\u2019s powerful distribution channels are a major force that might highly threaten incumbents in this industry. Also, the search giant, Alphabet, has forayed into the food delivery market with its delivery arm, Wing, and an array of food delivery apps, which are likely to intensify competition.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Internet - Delivery Services industry is housed within the broader Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185, which places it among the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the industry\u2019s performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Outperforms the S&P 500 and the Sector\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery industry has outperformed the S&P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector over the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 55.3% during this period, while the S&P 500 and the broader sector have advanced 19.2% and 25.8%, respectively.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Internet-Delivery stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.29X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 5.09X and the sector\u2019s 6.30X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.34X and as low as 0.57X and recorded a median of 0.89X.\n\n4 Stocks in Focus\n\nGoDaddy: It is an Internet domain registrar and web hosting company that also sells e-business-related software and services.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nGoDaddy is benefiting from strong momentum across the Applications & Commerce business and its expanding global footprint. Strength in Create & Grow solutions is aiding the Application & Commerce segment\u2019s top-line growth. Website plus marketing, driven by greater engagement with customers based on new product launches, is contributing well. Strong renewals & registrations and the expansion of the GoDaddy Registry are major catalysts. Growth in bookings, primarily driven by strong customer additions and price increases in various domains, has been a key catalyst.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised downward by a penny to $6.49 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nMakeMyTrip: It is an online travel service company that offers travel products and solutions in India and the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 company's services and products include air tickets, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, railway tickets, bus tickets and car hire. It also facilitates access to travel insurance.\n\nMakeMyTrip is gaining substantially from improving travel conditions and the reopening of economies post-pandemic. In addition, recovering hotel demand as a result of the rise in short-stay getaway vacations, great travel deals and hygienically safe properties is a major upside. Also, the company is optimistic about its cost-control initiatives, MySafety and GoSafe programs, and strengthening the hotel business.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 2 cents to $1.36 per share in the past seven days.\n\nQuinStreet: It is a provider of online direct marketing and media services. QuinStreet offers online messaging, e-mail broadcasting, search engine marketing and brand management services.\n\nQuinStreet is benefiting from the accelerated shift from an offline to an online business model across industries. Ad spending is likely to continue increasing, driven by an improving macroeconomic environment and business activities. The company is well-positioned to bank on this opportunity and acquire new customers and high-value deals.\n\nQuinStreet carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 2 cents to 61 cents in the past 60 days.\n\nAsure Software: This is a cloud computing firm that offers business clients the chance to modernize everything from human capital management (HCM) and time & attendance solutions to payroll and taxes. Asure Software\u2019s strategic initiative to become a pure software-as-a-service HCM company is aiding its top-line growth. This Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s focus on driving innovation for its HCM solutions is helping it expand its footprint in the HCM market.\n\nNew client additions and a continued focus on cross-selling to existing clients are driving Asure Software\u2019s revenues. The company\u2019s differentiated employee strategy, measurement capabilities and comprehensive product offerings are helping it win new customers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asure Software\u2019s 2024 earnings has remained unchanged at 76 cents per share in the past 60 days.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks That Can Create Millionaires by 2030",
        "content": "In June 2010, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was listed with a market valuation of $2.23 billion. Currently, the EV maker commands a market valuation of $785 billion. During this period, the company\u2019s market valuation has increased by more than 50% CAGR. Of course, not all companies can be Tesla. However, there are millionaire-maker growth stocks to buy that can make investors rich.\n\nIf we look at Tesla\u2019s story, there are two lessons for investors. First, patience is the key to massive wealth creation. Trading good stocks is unlikely to create wealth. The key is buying and holding for the long term.\n\nFurther, there are instances of deep corrections during the journey from $2.23 billion to $785 billion. Investors need to avoid panic selling and focus entirely on the growth story and the progress in fundamentals.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this overview, let\u2019s discuss seven millionaire-maker growth stocks worth considering for the next five to seven years.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe flying car industry is at a nascent stage. However, it is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2040. Early movers with good execution can undoubtedly create massive wealth. Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is an attractive bet in the eVTOL industry.\n\nFirst, I would mention that investors in Archer include Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). The backing of blue-chip companies underscores the business\u2019s potential. Recently, Archer partnered with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) to develop operational plans for electric air taxi networks utilizing Archer\u2019s eVTOL aircraft at California airports.\n\nIn the international markets, Archer has formed partnerships in the UAE, India and Korea to commercialize eVTOL. Therefore, Archer is setting a strong base for growth in 2025 and beyond. It\u2019s worth noting that the company is also expected to complete the construction of its manufacturing facility by the end of the year. This will support the production of 650 eVTOL annually and help scale up operations.\n\nZEEKR Intelligent Technology (ZK) ZEEKR logo is seen at one of its stores in Ningbo, China. Zeekr is a premium electric automobile brand owned by the Chinese automaker, Geely Automobile Holdings. ZK stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric vehicle stocks have witnessed a significant correction due to macroeconomic headwinds, competition and trade wars. However, EV adoption will continue to increase in the coming years, and the correction is a good opportunity to accumulate quality growth stocks. ZEEKR Intelligent Technology (NYSE:ZK) is a recently listed EV company that looks promising.\n\nFor Q1 2024, ZEEKR delivered 33,059 vehicles, up 117% yearly. Revenue for the period increased by 73% to $1.1 billion. While the company reported an operating loss of $289 million, it was lower by 29% yearly. With a healthy vehicle margin and operating leverage, I expect losses to narrow further in the coming quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nI must add that for the first half of the year, ZEEKR reported a 106% growth in deliveries to 87,870 vehicles. The growth is robust even amidst macroeconomic headwinds. In June, the EV company entered cooperation agreements with PT Premium Auto Prima in Indonesia and Sentinel Automotive in Malaysia. With entry into two high-potential markets, I expect robust growth to be sustained.\n\nTempus AI (TEM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American health care company Tempus Labs Inc. on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) is another new listing with multi-bagger returns potential. As an overview, Tempus AI is a healthcare technology company. In the coming years, artificial intelligence is likely to impact sectors, and Tempus is unleashing the power of AI for the healthcare industry.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s focus on research and development is yielding results. In June, the company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for Tempus ECG-AF device \u201cthat uses AI to help identify patients who may be at increased risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services granted advanced diagnostic laboratory test status for the company\u2019s next-generation sequencing assay. For the year ended December 2023, Tempus reported revenue of $531.8 million. On a year-on-year basis, revenue increased by 65.8%. As more products are launched, Tempus is positioned to accelerate growth in the coming years.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS) Graphic of hands holding coins with growth arrows heading upward in background. hypergrowth stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Lemonsoup14\n\nGlobal defense spending hit record highs of $2.44 trillion in 2023. Considering rising geopolitical tensions, defense spending growth will likely be robust. Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is attractive among emerging defense companies.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that DRS stock has surged by 65% in the last 12 months. I would look at corrections for fresh exposure to the stock. Considering the company\u2019s focus on innovation, I am bullish on multibagger returns.\n\nThe provider of defense electronic products and systems reported an order backlog of $7.8 billion as of Q1 2024. The order backlog has swelled by 84% year over year. A robust order intake will support revenue growth acceleration.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Leonardo reported revenue growth of 21% on a year-on-year basis to $688 million. For the same period, adjusted EBITDA was $70 million with EBITDA margin expanding by 160 basis points to 10.2%. I expect further margin expansion on operating leverage in the next few years.\n\nCronos (CRON) Cronos (CRON)\n\nSome cannabis stocks are likely to create massive wealth for investors by the end of the decade. Even without federal legalization, the U.S. cannabis market is expected to be worth $71 billion. Further, Europe has a big market for medicinal cannabis, and regulations are likely to become friendlier.\n\nCronos (NASDAQ:CRON) is a potential millionaire-maker growth stock to buy from the cannabis sector. I like that the company has been prudent in its spending. As of Q1 2024, Cronos had a cash buffer of $855 million.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Cronos was focused on Canada and Israel. However, the company has pursued geographical expansion into new markets, including Germany, Australia and the United Kingdom. This is likely to support growth acceleration and improvement in EBITDA margin.\n\nWith the possibility of cannabis being reclassified as a Schedule III drug in the United States, I expect Cronos to pursue organic or acquisition-driven growth. Backed by strong fundamentals, Cronos is positioned for stellar growth and value creation.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed by 215% in the last 12 months. It makes sense to wait for a correction to enter. However, there is no doubt that the company will likely deliver multi-fold revenue growth by the end of the decade.\n\nAs an overview, MakeMyTrip provides online booking solutions for the travel and tourism industry in India. By 2030, Indians are expected to be the fourth-largest global travel spenders, with spending expected to hit $410 billion. As a leading player in the industry, MakeMyTrip is positioned to benefit.\n\nFor the financial year 2024, MakeMyTrip reported the highest annual gross booking of $7.9 billion. For the same period, operating profit was $124.2 million. It\u2019s worth noting that MakeMyTrip reported an operating loss of $69.9 million in FY20. The recovery from the pandemic has been significant, and I expect healthy revenue growth coupled with margin expansion.\n\nMiniso Group Holdings (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nI believe that Miniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) is an undervalued stock that\u2019s likely to create value in the long term. The stock of the lifestyle retailer trades at a forward P/E of 14.4 and offers a dividend yield of 2.31%. With ambitious growth plans, I expect a strong reversal for MNSO stock from current levels.\n\nOne reason for MNSO being depressed is negative sentiments related to Chinese stocks. From a financial perspective, growth has been robust and should have been associated with a rally. To put things into perspective, for Q1 2024, Miniso reported revenue growth of 26% to $515.7 million. For the same period, EBITDA margin expanded by 200 basis points to 25.9%.\n\nStark growth is likely to continue in the next five years. Miniso plans to open 900 to 1,100 new stores annually between 2024 and 2028. The company has guided revenue growth at a CAGR of more than 20%. With operating leverage, the EBITDA margin is likely to be higher than current levels. Miniso is, therefore, positioned to report healthy cash flows.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Does MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.\n\nIf this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide MakeMyTrip with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MakeMyTrip\n\nHow Fast Is MakeMyTrip Growing Its Earnings Per Share?\n\nInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It is awe-striking that MakeMyTrip's EPS went from US$0.16 to US$2.00 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?\n\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that MakeMyTrip's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The good news is that MakeMyTrip is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.3 percentage points to 8.9%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of MakeMyTrip's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.\n\nAre MakeMyTrip Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nSince MakeMyTrip has a market capitalisation of US$11b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$216m. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould You Add MakeMyTrip To Your Watchlist?\n\nMakeMyTrip's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering MakeMyTrip for a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - MakeMyTrip has  1 warning sign  we think you should be aware of.\n\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "MakeMyTrip Group CEO Rajesh Magow at the Skift India Summit. Skift\n\nIndia\u2019s rising middle class and higher disposable income have boosted spending on discretionary services, while the growing lower middle class has bolstered domestic travel, said Rajesh Magow, group CEO of MakeMyTrip, during an earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nMagow highlighted the impact of younger generations driving a cultural shift towards more frequent breaks.\n\nHe also noted a positive long-term outlook for outbound travel from India with fast-growing pools of first-time tourists, particularly to emerging destinations like Turkey and Kazakhstan, which have seen significant increases in Indian tourists.\n\n\u201cFor Kazakhstan, India is now the third largest source market witnessing a threefold increase in Indian tourists compared to 2021. For Turkey, the number of tourists from India has surged 34% in the first five months of 2024 compared to same period last year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shift to flexible working arrangements has influenced travel behavior, with more people combining work and leisure, Magow noted. MakeMyTrip has also added new travel products and services targeting specific demographics like millennials and Gen Z.\n\nIndia\u2019s Domestic Travel Boom\n\nMagow expects the domestic air market to improve further in the second half of the financial year.\n\nAs per a McKinsey report, India is currently the world\u2019s sixth largest domestic travel market by spending, buoyed by the rising middle class.\n\nThe Indian domestic market could overtake Japan and Mexico to become the world\u2019s fourth largest by 2030, Magow said. Domestic air passenger traffic in India is also projected to double by 2030, boosted by government initiatives to build infrastructure and connect underserved domestic airports.\n\nThe Numbers\n\nMakeMyTrip reported its highest-ever quarterly gross bookings, revenue, and adjusted operating profit, with gross booking value exceeding $2.4 billion, a 22% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Adjusted operating profit grew by 30% year-on-year to $39 million for the period ending June 30, 2024.\n\n\u201cWe delivered these strong numbers despite the late pickup of the season for leisure travel due to general elections in April,\u201d said Magow. \r\n\r\n\u201cA wide spectrum of travel products is also helping us increase our share of the wallet Indian travelers overall travel spend. We now have a lifetime transacted user base of 75 million across all our 3 brands to build stronger loyalty,\u201d Magow said.\n\nThe company has also relaunched its flagship loyalty program, MMT Black, with new benefits to boost customer retention and loyalty. The program has been relaunched with simplified 2 tiers and new benefits such as guaranteed room upgrades and meal upgrades for participating hotels and homestays.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cAlthough it is early days of the new MMT Black program rollout, we have already seen improvement in the operating metrics compared to the earlier version indicating better value for our Black customers,\u201d Magow said.\n\nOther Key Points\n\nAI and Technology Enhancements: MakeMyTrip introduced its the GenAI-assisted chatbot Myra on its international flight booking funnel. \u201cWe plan to make Myra more and more intelligent using consumer insights in the future,\u201d Magow said.\n\nAirport Ancillary Services: The OTA has introduced premium airport services such as meet and assist facilities and plans to expand this on its international funnel as well.\n\nRegional Booking Funnel: The company has launched Tamil booking funnel on Android platform, in addition to the existing Hindi funnel, helping it to cater to new regional users and drive deeper penetration.\n\nAccommodation Business: The OTA\u2019s accommodation business that includes hotels, homestays and packages continues to witness strong growth. \u201cAs we improve our penetration, we continue to add more properties across the country and now offer properties in over 2,100 cities in India,\u201d Magow said.\n\nCorporate Travel: MakeMyTrip\u2019s corporate travel business through its platforms \u2014 myBiz and Quest2Travel, has also witnessed strong growth. The active corporate customer count on myBiz is now over 59,700 and for Quest2Travel, the active customer count has reached 458 large corporates compared to 272 in the same quarter last year, Magow said. \u201cWe have increased the personalization quotient on the platform,\u201d he said.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.",

        "content": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 95%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online travel company would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of 46.15%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nMakeMyTrip , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry, posted revenues of $254.52 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $196.73 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nMakeMyTrip shares have added about 90.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for MakeMyTrip?\n\nWhile MakeMyTrip has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MakeMyTrip: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.21 on $216.03 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.34 on $946.59 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Delivery Services is currently in the bottom 8% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nAsure Software Inc (ASUR), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 1.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nAsure Software Inc's revenues are expected to be $28.56 million, down 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Millionaire-Making Growth Stocks to Buy and Forget",
        "content": "Before entering the markets, investors need to clearly define their objective. If the idea is to take low-risk and beat inflation, it makes sense to go overweight on blue-chip stocks trading at attractive valuations. If the idea is to generate regular cash flows, investors should be overweight on high dividend yield stocks. Additionally, if the idea is to make massive wealth from the markets, the only way is exposure to millionaire-maker growth stocks.\n\nThis column focuses on growth stocks to buy that can deliver multibagger returns by the end of the decade. It\u2019s important to note that massive wealth cannot be made overnight. It requires patience and the ability to hold through the thick and thin. Even the best growth stocks can have intermediate corrections of 20% to 30%.\n\nLet\u2019s therefore discuss seven high-risk growth stocks to buy and hold through 2030. These companies are fundamentally sound and have a big addressable market. If the business execution remains good, multi-fold growth in revenue and cash flow is likely.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTempus AI (TEM) A concept image of a glowing blue brain to depict AI\n\nSource: Andrus Ciprian / Shutterstock.com\n\nTempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) stock was listed last month and seems to be under-the-radar. I see this as a good buying opportunity for the long term. As an overview, Tempus AI is a healthcare technology company. The company claims to have one of the world\u2019s largest libraries of clinical and molecular data.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that anything related to AI has garnered investor interest in the recent past. However, the Tempus story is not limited to euphoria. The company has made significant developments related to next generation sequencing diagnostics, among others.\n\nLast month, Tempus received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its \u201cTempus ECG-AF device that uses AI to help identify patients who may be at increased risk of atrial fibrillation.\u201d\n\nFurther, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have granted \u201cAdvanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test (ADLT) status for Tempus\u2019 next-generation sequencing assay, xT CDx.\u201d\n\nThese developments underscore the company\u2019s growth potential and the investment in R&D. With AI backed precision medicine and diagnostics industry still at a nascent stage, Tempus has ample headroom for growth and value creation.\n\nArcher Aviation (ACHR) Person holding cellphone with logo of American eVTOL aircraft company Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe flying car industry is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2040. It goes without saying that the early-movers have a big advantage and can be massive wealth creators. However, it\u2019s important to be selective as there will be companies that will perish amidst competition and lack of technological edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nArcher Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) is among the flying car companies that seems poised for growth and value creation. In the last one month, ACHR stock has zoomed by 70%. This is on the back of positive business developments as the company targets 2025 for commercialization of eVTOL.\n\nSince we are talking about a long term investment horizon, it\u2019s important to mention that investors in Archer include Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL). This underscores the potential in the company and industry.\n\nRecently, Archer signed an agreement with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) for \u201celectric air taxi networks utilizing Archer\u2019s eVTOL aircraft at California airports.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that Archer has local partnerships in the UAE, India, and Korea for expansion in the next 24 months. I therefore expect stellar growth in the coming years.\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS) Veterans Day. US soldiers. US army. USA patch flag on the US military uniform. United States Armed Forces. Defense stocks\n\nSource: Bumble Dee / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense spending touched record highs of $2.44 trillion last year. It\u2019s likely that defense spending will continue to increase with several points of geopolitical friction globally. With positive industry tailwinds, there is scope for wealth creation from the industry.\n\nLeonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) is among the emerging defense companies that hold immense potential. In the last 12 months, DRS stock has surged by 64%. However, with a swelling order backlog and focus on next-generation defense technology, I expect the stock to remain in an uptrend.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as of Q1 2024, Leonardo reported an order backlog of $7.8 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the company\u2019s backlog swelled by 84%. If the order intake remains robust, I expect revenue growth acceleration.\n\nFurther, Leonardo reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2% for Q1 2024. On a year-on-year basis, EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points. With operating leverage, I expect margin expansion to sustain coupled with cash flow upside.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) is a lifestyle retailer with global presence and aggressive growth plans. In my view, MNSO stock is massively undervalued at a forward P/E of 14.8. Further, the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 2.22%.\n\nWhile MNSO stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months, business developments have remained positive. For Q1 2024, the company reported healthy revenue growth of 26% on a year-on-year basis to $515.7 million. For the same period, EBITDA increased by 36.7% to $133.7 million. Growth has therefore been associated with EBITDA margin expansion.\n\nIn terms of expansion plans, Miniso intends to open 900 to 1,100 new stores annually between 2024 and 2028. The lifestyle retailer has also guided for revenue CAGR of over 20% during this period. With operating leverage, EBITDA margin is likely to expand and as cash flows swell, dividend growth will be robust.\n\nZEEKR Intelligent Technology (ZK) Photo of steel blue electric car being charged with wind silos and blue sky in the background. EV\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Alexander Steamaze\n\nZEEKR Intelligent Technology (NYSE:ZK) is a recently listed EV company that holds promise. The company is involved in the production of EVs and batteries with presence in China, Europe, and several other markets.\n\nRecently, ZEEKR announced June deliveries and the numbers were stellar. For the month, the EV company delivered 20,106 vehicles, which was higher by 89% on a year-on-year basis. Further, for year-to-date, deliveries growth has been 106% to 87,870 vehicles.\n\nIn a major development, ZEEKR entered into agreements with PT Premium Auto Prima and Sentinel Automotive. This gives the company an entry into Indonesia and Malaysia respectively. These are attractive emerging markets and will boost deliveries growth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for Q1 2024, ZEEKR reported operating level losses. However, vehicle margin was healthy at 14%. With stellar top-line growth, I expect losses to narrow. Further, ZEEKR has strong support from its parent company, Geely Group. I therefore don\u2019t see any concerns related to financing growth and R&D.\n\nCronos Group (CRON) scientist checking organic hemp wild plants in a cannabis weed commercial greenhouse.

Cannabis stocks, FLGC stocks\n\nSource: Chokniti-Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong the penny stocks with millionaire-maker potential, Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) looks attractive. The cannabis stock has been trending higher, but remains undervalued. With the possibility of regulations turning friendlier for the industry, CRON stock can go ballistic.\n\nI like the fact that Cronos has a strong cash buffer of $855 million. This will allow the company to pursue organic and acquisition driven growth in the coming years.\n\nWhile Cronos has not be active on the acquisition front, the company is focusing on geographic expansion. In the last few quarters, the cannabis player has entered Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Considering the financial flexibility, further inroads in Europe is likely and will support growth acceleration.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Cronos reported revenue growth of 30% on a year-on-year basis to $25.3 million. With the recent geographic expansion, I expect robust growth coupled with improvement in EBITDA margin. It\u2019s likely that Cronos will achieve EBITDA break-even in the next few quarters. That\u2019s an impending catalyst for CRON stock surging higher.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed by 200% in the last 12 months. After a big rally from oversold levels, MMYT stock valuations look stretched. I would wait for a 15% to 20% correction from current levels before considering fresh exposure.\n\nHaving said that, there is no doubt that MakeMyTrip will continue to grow at a healthy pace in the coming years. The company is India\u2019s largest online travel booking services provider.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that Indian travellers will be the fourth largest global spenders by 2030 with the spending predicted to hit $410 billion. Clearly, there is a big opportunity and MakeMyTrip is well positioned to benefit.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that MakeMyTrip had reported operating loss of $69.9 million for financial year 2020. For the last financial year (FY24), the company reported operating profit of $124.2 million. With healthy revenue growth, operating leverage will ensure further improvement in margins. The business is likely to be a cash flow machine in the next few years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy Now: Q3 Edition",
        "content": "Top growth stocks to buy now can be your route to compounding your wealth. If you buy early in the growth phase, you can ride the expansion phase for several years to massive gains. On that note, small and midcap stocks are better growth plays than large-cap ones.\n\nIn fairness, most large-cap stocks rarely have the upside of smaller capitalization stocks. The law of large numbers means that large-cap companies cannot grow as fast. Furthermore, because they are widely covered by Wall Street analysts, business media and investors, they are priced accordingly.\n\nIn contrast, some smaller growth stocks have massive upside. With a secular tailwind and solid execution, they can increase revenues for decades. Furthermore, due to minimal coverage, they are likely to be mispriced and trade at a discount to larger peers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stocks to buy now have market capitalizations below $20 billion. Besides, they have increased sales at an over 60% compounded annual growth rate over the past three years. Yet, with their secular tailwinds still intact, they have years of growth ahead.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings logo with silhouette of man using smartphone. is an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting company. DKNG stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is the second largest sports wagering platform, with a 32% market share in the U.S. Over the past five years, it has seen impressive growth as sports betting has become more popular. As a result, revenues grew by 72% and 63% in 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nStill, with online sports betting growth exceeding 10% annually, according to Statista, DKNG stock is attractive. Indeed, wagering is growing with more state approvals leading to customer growth. After launching in Vermont this January, DraftKings now operates in 26 U.S. states. This leaves substantial opportunity as more states approve online betting and iGaming.\n\nMoreover, management expects more expansion in its existing markets. During the Q1 of 2024 earnings call, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jason Robins noted that revenues grew by 40% in existing states. Also, he projected more revenue from product innovations. For instance, he said they introduced Progressive Parlay products across all major sports and states during Q1. Moreover, in iGaming, it launched eight new casino titles.\n\nAnother catalyst that makes DraftKings one of the growth stocks to buy now relates to profitability. After growing revenues by 51% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 and achieving $22 million in adjusted EBITDA, management lifted its guidance. They expect revenues between $4.8 to $5 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $460 million to $540 million. The shift from losses to positive EBITDA will attract more institutional investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nAfter posting a record fiscal year 2024, MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) shines among the growth stocks to buy now. Indeed, 2024 was a year of records highlighting the growth trajectory of this online booking provider. In fiscal year 2024, the company achieved an all-time high gross booking value of $8 billion. Moreover, operating profit grew from $70 million in FY2023 to a record $124 million.\n\nMakeMyTrip has several tailwinds that will support growth for several years. As the leading travel services provider in India, it\u2019s benefiting from GDP per capita growth in India that\u2019s increasing disposable incomes. In line with this growth, management expects religious tourism to grow at a 16% CAGR between 2023 and 2030.\n\nSo far, the financial performance has reflected the growth in inbound and outbound tourism in India. Further, Q4 of 2024 results released on May 15 showed that the air ticketing business grew revenues by 41.6% YOY. Meanwhile, bus ticketing and hotel and packages grew by 27.1% and 30%, respectively.\n\nAs one of the largest travel platforms in India, MakeMyTrip has an unmatched customer reach with over 72 million lifetime customers. As the online travel market grows from $12 billion in 2022 to $60 billion by 2030, MMYT stock will soar.\n\nToast (TOST) Portrait of a happy waitress standing at restaurant entrance holding digital tablet. Restaurant.\n\nSource: Rido / Shutterstock\n\nBoston, Massachusetts-based Toast (NYSE:TOST) is a cloud-based digital platform for the restaurant industry. Its SaaS solution is a restaurant operating system covering all aspects, from payment processing to back-of-house operations.\n\nOn the growth front, Toast has achieved over 40% growth in the last three fiscal years. Still, it retains best-in-class growth, managing 31% revenue growth in Q1 of 2024. Management expects to maintain a higher growth rate through expanding locations and market share, driving annual recurring revenue (ARR) through platform growth and expanding into new adjacencies.\n\nFirst quarter results highlighted the solid execution on these key priorities. Toast added over 6,000 net locations driven by its go-to-market engine and purpose-built restaurant platform. Also, ARR grew due to its tier system, which allows customers to adopt more of the platform over time. As of March 31, annualized ARR grew 32% to $1.3 billion.\n\nIn terms of new adjacencies, Toast is expanding into countries like the U.K., Canada and Ireland. Moreover, it\u2019s expanding upmarket into the enterprise tier. These growth drivers, plus the management\u2019s focus on operating leverage, mean Toast is one of the top growth stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why",
        "content": "Investors might want to bet on MakeMyTrip (MMYT), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for MakeMyTrip basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor MakeMyTrip, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for MakeMyTrip\n\nThis online travel company is expected to earn $1.62 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 32.8%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for MakeMyTrip. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 12.4%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of MakeMyTrip to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) Beats Stock Market Upswing: What Investors Need to Know",
        "content": "In the latest trading session, MakeMyTrip (MMYT) closed at $86.66, marking a +0.83% move from the previous day. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.08%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.28%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the online travel company had gained 6.84% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.41% and outpaced the S&P 500's gain of 4.08% in that time.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of MakeMyTrip in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $0.38, showcasing a 26.67% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $230.58 million, indicating a 17.21% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $1.62 per share and a revenue of $926.3 million, demonstrating changes of +32.79% and +27.21%, respectively, from the preceding year.\n\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for MakeMyTrip. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. Right now, MakeMyTrip possesses a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\n\nDigging into valuation, MakeMyTrip currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 53.22. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.16.\n\nIt is also worth noting that MMYT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.6. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MMYT's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.55 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Internet - Delivery Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 27, placing it within the top 11% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Emerging Markets Spotlight: 7 Hidden Gems Set to Explode",
        "content": "Investors generally should consider market ideas with which they\u2019re most familiar. That\u2019s a relatively obvious point. With that in mind, most Americans should focus domestically for a host of reasons, not just familiarity. However, going abroad has its benefits, which leads us to today\u2019s topic: hidden gems among emerging market stocks.\n\nAgain, the meat of one\u2019s portfolio should theoretically be U.S.-based. We live here, work here and we know the ins and outs. That said, one of the key benefits of emerging market stocks is diversification. Even if your portfolio is geared entirely toward growth-focused ideas, it pays to diversify this growth. As a rule of thumb, you don\u2019t want all your eggs in one basket.\n\nHowever, the real kicker for targeting international markets is the underlying growth opportunity. Even with the post-pandemic pressures, certain regions are expanding at a faster pace than their mature counterparts. On that note, below are compelling emerging market stocks to consider.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCemex (CX) A person wearing work clothes scoops cement out of a bucket.\n\nSource: chomplearn / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Mexico, Cemex (NYSE:CX) falls under the building materials industry. Per its public profile, the company produces, markets, distributes and sells cement, ready-mix concrete and other aggregate-based solutions for the construction services sector. Mexico happens to be one of the top emerging nations and has been growing at a relatively high clip despite difficult global challenges.\n\nAs the world continues to recover from Covid-19, I expect Mexico to continue to lead in terms of growth magnitude. Admittedly, the recent financials have been lacking. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q4, the company produced an earnings loss of one-cent per share. However, earnings per share popped up to 17 cents in Q1 2024, beating the analysts\u2019 estimate of 13 cents.\n\nPossibly, Mexico is back on the rise. If so, CX stock is intriguing. Right now, shares trade at 0.51X trailing-year sales. However, the average print between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 was 0.63X.\n\nEven better, experts anticipate that Cemex\u2019s top line could reach $18.03 billion, up 3.5% from the prior year. That makes CX one of the emerging market stocks to consider.\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) Shipping label of a box from Himax. HIMX stock.\n\nSource: Mamat Suryadi / Shutterstock\n\nInterestingly, those who are interested in emerging market stocks but not in China have some intriguing options to consider. One of them is right next door in Taiwan and that brings us to Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX). Operating in the broader semiconductor space, Himax is a fabless enterprise specializing in display imaging processing technologies. As long as televisions, monitors, laptops and other interactive devices are relevant, HIMX stock should be on your radar.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter starting the year off on a dour note, Himax has started to turn the ship around. Since the start of the year, HIMX stock gained 23% of its equity value. Further, between Q3 and Q1, the company posted an average EPS of nearly nine cents. That\u2019s above the analysts\u2019 consensus view of seven cents. The earnings surprise during this period came out to 36.07%.\n\nNow, where Himax gets a bit tricky is in the valuation department. In the past year, HIMX traded at 1.05X trailing-year sales. Right now, the statistic is up at 1.44X. Conspicuously, the latest quarterly sales growth rate (year-over-year) sits at 15% below parity.\n\nFiscal 2024 admittedly may turn out to be rough. However, a slow recovery may take place in fiscal 2025, with a sales target of $1 billion. For the patient speculator, HIMX could be one of the emerging market stocks to buy.\n\nGrab (GRAB) Motorcycle helmet with Grab logo on a motorcycle parked at the road side\n\nSource: Nor Sham Soyod / Shutterstock.com\n\nCalling Singapore home, Grab (NASDAQ:GRAB) represents one of the most exciting ideas among emerging market stocks. Technically speaking, Grab falls under the application software realm. Per its corporate profile, it offers a digital platform \u2013 essentially a super app \u2013 that covers a range of services, including mobility and digital financial services. It targets burgeoning markets such as Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nEnticingly, the Southeast Asian internet economy could become a trillion-dollar ecosystem. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential for Grab to, well, grab as much market share in this space as possible. In terms of the bottom line, it hasn\u2019t been profitable. In the trailing 12 months (TTM), it incurred a net loss of $294 million.\n\nHowever, the top line saw a print of $2.49 billion. Further, the most recent quarterly sales growth rate stands at 24.4%. What\u2019s really enticing here is the valuation. Currently, GRAB stock trades at 5.57X trailing-year sales. However, in the past year, the metric rose to 6.73X. There\u2019s room to run.\n\nAnalysts believe fiscal 2024 sales could pop 17.8% to $2.78 billion. GRAB is easily one of the emerging market stocks to consider.\n\nSea (SE) The logo for Sea Limited is seen on a web browser through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother Singapore-based enterprise, Sea (NYSE:SE) falls under the consumer cylical sector, specifically internet retail. Along with its subsidiaries, Sea engages in three core service/product areas: digital entertainment, e-commerce and digital financial services or fintech (financial technology). Because of the aforementioned burgeoning Southeast Asian market, Sea could tap into a viable ecosystem.\n\nGranted, there could be some competitive overlap with Grab that needs monitoring. Nevertheless, Sea also features distinct advantages in the internet content and e-commerce arenas. To be fair, the financial performances recently have been hit or miss. In the past four quarters, Sea\u2019s average EPS landed at only 1.3 cents. That\u2019s not great compared to the analysts\u2019 expectations of 4.3 cents.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to consider the growth opportunity. In the TTM period, revenue hit $13.76 billion. What\u2019s more, in the most recent quarter, the sales growth rate clocked in at 22.8%. That\u2019s more like it.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate that sales will rise to $15.41 billion. That\u2019s up 17.9% from the previous year. Further, the high-side target calls for revenue of $16.79 billion. For speculators, it\u2019s an enticing play for emerging market stocks.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nBased in India, MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is potentially a high-risk, high-reward idea among emerging market stocks. In recent years, India has been flexing its economic muscle, rising up the GDP ranks. In so doing, one can expect its consumer cyclical sector to rise. Operating in the travel sectors sector, MakeMyTrip sells various travel products and services in India, along with other international markets.\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that the travel prioritization phenomenon that has buoyed the U.S. travel sector could impact India. Again, we\u2019re talking about a rapidly growing economy. Thanks to the collective wealth creation, Indian consumers also want to see the world. What\u2019s encouraging here is the financials. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS landed at 29 cents. That\u2019s well above the average estimate of 16 cents.\n\nIt must be said that MMYT stock trades at a premium, specifically 13.41X trailing-year sales. In the past year, this metric sat at 7.09X. However, the most recent quarterly sales growth rate shot up to 36.6%.\n\nFor the current year, experts believe revenue could rise 25.7% to $983.61 million. Again, it\u2019s an enticing candidate for emerging market stocks to buy.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHeadquartered in Montevideo, Uruguay, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) also operates in the consumer cyclical space, specifically internet retail. According to its public profile, MercadoLibre operates its namesake online marketplace. This e-commerce platform enables businesses, merchants and individuals to list merchandise and conduct sales and purchases digitally. It\u2019s potentially one of the transformative enterprises in the broader Latin American market.\n\nGenerally speaking, the financials have been robust. If you took away a bad miss in Q4, the results in the past four quarters would have been impressive. Unfortunately, there was a huge miss in Q4 so the average EPS during the aforementioned period was $5.59. That stands in sharp contrast to the expected print of $5.88.\n\nMELI stock has incurred some choppy trading in the market subsequently. Still, this could open a discounted opportunity. Right now, shares trade at 5.18X trailing-year revenue. However, in the past year, the metric shot up to 5.71X.\n\nThere may be significant room to run, though, because analysts believe sales could hit $19.13 billion this year. If so, that would be up 32.2% from the prior year.\n\nNu (NU) hand using online banking and icon on tablet screen device in coffee shop\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nBased in Brazil, Nu (NYSE:NU) provides a digital banking platform in Mexico, Colombia, the Cayman Islands, Argentina, Uruguay and its home market. It also serves the U.S. and Germany. According to the corporate profile, Nu offers various services, including credit and prepaid payment cards. Further, it promotes mobile payment solutions. Fundamentally, as digitalization brings connectivity across the globe, Nu could be a top beneficiary.\n\nIt\u2019s been delivering the goods recently. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average EPS landed at 7.3 cents. That beats out the average analysts\u2019 estimate of 6.5 cents. Further, the average earnings surprise came out to 13.55%. However, the real story here may be the growth narrative.\n\nIn the TTM period, revenue hit $4.27 billion. In the most recent quarter, the sales growth rate shot up to nearly 80%. What\u2019s enticing is that the current multiple of 9.31X trailing-year sales isn\u2019t that bad. In the past year, this metric stood at 8.94X.\n\nFurther, in fiscal 2024, sales could hit $11.74 billion, up 46.3%. In the following year, the top line could expand to $14.83 billion, another 26.3% gain. NU is easily one of the emerging market stocks to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "The 3 Best Asian Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Asia is, of course, an incredibly vast continent. But most of the Asian companies in which Americans can and should invest are based in either China or India. Since the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese economy has been stuck in a deep slump. And though it still has major problems, including a very weak real estate market, it is showing signs of rebounding.\n\nFor example, last month the country\u2019s retail sales rose 3.7% versus May 2023 while its industrial production advanced 5.6% year-over-year. For its part, the Indian economy, boosted by the opening of many factories that have relocated from China, grew at a blistering 8.2% above inflation during its fiscal year that ended in March 2024. And the country\u2019s central bank expects the economy to expand at a fast pace of 7.2% during the current fiscal year, up from its previous estimate of 7% growth.\n\nWith China\u2019s economy showing signs of recovery and India looking like the \u201cnext big thing\u201d from an investing standpoint, here are the three best Asian stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNot only is India\u2019s economy growing at an extremely rapid pace but foreigners are investing large amounts into the country. As of May 11, U.S.-based ETFs that invest in Indian stocks benefited from almost $2.7 billion of net inflows since the beginning of the year. That trend paused briefly earlier this month amid doubts about whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be reelected. But after it became clear he would remain in office, the pattern resumed, with foreign investors buying $985.5 million of Indian stocks on June 7 and June 10, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAmong the key beneficiaries of foreign interest in Indian stocks has been The WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSEARCA:EPI). Shares climbed 12% in the last three months and it should continue to advance as optimism about the Asian country\u2019s economy increases.\n\nThe WisdomTree India Earnings Fund\u2019s holdings are very diversified. Financial services companies account for 21.8% of its holdings while basic materials firms weigh in at 13.4%. Technology stands at 10.5% and industrials are at 9.6%.\n\nGiven the ETF\u2019s well-diversified exposure to the rapidly growing Indian economy, it is one of the best Asian stocks to buy.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading Indian online travel agency MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), boosted by India\u2019s rapidly expanding middle class, continued to grow very rapidly and quickly increase its profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter its top line jumped 36.6% versus the same period a year earlier to $148.5 million, while operating profits, excluding certain items, soared 70.4% year-over-year to $19.03 million. For all of fiscal 2024, the company\u2019s adjusted operating profit came in at a brisk $124 million, up from $70 million during the prior year.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the trend of increasing disposable income among Indians, spurred by the country\u2019s strong economic growth, CEO Rajesh Magow\u00a0reported last month. The company is also getting a big lift from an increasing desire by tourists to view India\u2019s spiritual landmarks, Magow noted. Over the last two years, searches for spiritual destination on the company\u2019s platform have nearly doubled, he stated.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nChinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is continuing to grow incredibly rapidly, driven largely by the market share gains of its Temu marketplace. Temu caters to foreign consumers and its share of the U.S. retail market had reached a very impressive total of 17% in April.\n\nThe company\u2019s prices tend to be cheaper than Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) and it became the top overall shopping app on Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store.\n\nIn Q1, PDD\u2019s revenue soared 131% versus the same period a year earlier to $12 billion, while its operating profit jumped an incredible 275% year=-ver-year to $3.6 billion.\n\nOn May 24, Goldman Sachs responded to the firm\u2019s Q1 results by upgrading PDD stock to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral.\u201d The bank reported that the company is benefiting from rising ad revenue along with the increased profitability of Temu. Goldman placed a $184 price target on PDD stock, well above the shares\u2019 current price of around $150.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in EPI.

        "title": "Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In MakeMyTrip Limited's (NASDAQ:MMYT) Stock?",
        "content": "MakeMyTrip's (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock is up by a considerable 17% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to MakeMyTrip's  ROE today.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MakeMyTrip\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for MakeMyTrip is:\n\n19% = US$217m \u00f7 US$1.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit.\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\nMakeMyTrip's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE\n\nAt first glance, MakeMyTrip seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 58% seen over the past five years by MakeMyTrip. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nWe then compared MakeMyTrip's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 26% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if MakeMyTrip is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs MakeMyTrip Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nMakeMyTrip doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that MakeMyTrip's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

        "content": "In the latest market close, MakeMyTrip (MMYT) reached $78.71, with a +1% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.85%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.53%.\n\nThe online travel company's shares have seen an increase of 1.17% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.6% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 3.11%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of MakeMyTrip in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $0.38, signifying a 26.67% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $230.58 million, up 17.21% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $1.62 per share and a revenue of $926.3 million, signifying shifts of +32.79% and +18.37%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for MakeMyTrip. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.38% higher. At present, MakeMyTrip boasts a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nIn terms of valuation, MakeMyTrip is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 48.25. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.56, so one might conclude that MakeMyTrip is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that MMYT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.17. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Delivery Services industry was having an average PEG ratio of 2.34.\n\nThe Internet - Delivery Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 29, positioning it in the top 12% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy and Forget for 30X Returns by 2030",
        "content": "In a balanced portfolio, blue-chip stocks provide steady returns with the comfort of a low beta. On the other hand, growth stocks create big wealth. Today\u2019s blue-chip companies started their journey as promising growth stocks and became millionaires on the way. This column focuses on growth stocks to buy and hold until the end of the decade for multibagger returns.\n\nI have said in the past and will emphasize again that identifying a potential value creator is not a big challenge. The real challenge is to buy and hold through the thick and thin. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) listed in 2009 at a market valuation of $1.5 billion. The journey to current valuation of $550 billion has been through phases of deep corrections and extreme bearish views. If business developments are positive, cutting out the noise and holding with patience makes sense.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about seven growth stocks to buy and hold for massive value creation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), an iGaming and online sports betting (OSB) company, is a potential millionaire-maker. The gaming company has a big addressable market and ample headroom for growth in the coming years.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the iGaming and OSB market in the U.S. is expected to swell from $20 billion in 2023 to $30 billion by 2028. This is just for existing states, and as more states legalize gaming, the market size will swell. I also expect DraftKings to expand beyond the U.S. in the coming years. The European online sports betting market is expected to swell to $55.5 billion by 2032.\n\nWhile DraftKings was growing at a stellar pace, profitability was a concern. This concern has been addressed, and the gaming company expects to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $500 million for the year. Further, EBITDA is expected to swell to $1.4 billion in 2026 and $2.1 billion by 2028. With healthy revenue growth and profitability, DKNG stock will likely be a massive value creator.\n\nEHang Holdings (EH) An image of a lifesize white and black pilotable drone display in China with a man taking a picture of a woman in front of it.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nThe flying car industry is at a nascent stage, but estimates point to sustained growth in the next few decades. Therefore, some of the early movers can create immense value if their business execution is in the right direction. To put things into perspective, the flying car market is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2040. EHang Holdings (NASDAQ:EH) is among the most promising eVTOL stocks to buy and hold.\n\nEHang has already commercialized eVTOL in China. Further, the flying car company received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China for mass production of EH216-S pilotless eVTOL aircraft. This sets the stage for scaling up operations in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother important point to note is that EHang is making aggressive efforts toward international expansion. The company has already completed its first passenger-carrying demo flight in the UAE. Some other markets where demo flights have been conducted include Spain, Costa Rica and Japan. Therefore, I expect orders for the company\u2019s eVTOL to swell, translating into stellar growth.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe EV industry is facing headwinds in the near term, such as slow GDP growth, intense competition and relatively slow adoption of EVs. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, and it\u2019s a good time to accumulate potential value creators.\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) will likely be among the major industry players by the end of the decade. With LI stock trading at a forward P/E of 16.7, it\u2019s the best time to accumulate.\n\nI like that Li Auto has not gone overboard in terms of expansion. The EV company continues to focus on China exclusively, delivering good results. As of May, Li had retail stores, and growth will be supported as the network continues to expand.\n\nA cash buffer of $13.7 billion will support aggressive network expansion and investment in product development. Another reason to like Li is the company\u2019s continued efforts to remain ahead of the technological curve. The company is targeting the launch of level 3 self-driving technology by 2025.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIndia will likely be among the fastest growing countries in the world over the next decade. Several interesting sectors can create massive value. With a rising middle class, India\u2019s travel and tourism sector is expected to boom. Estimates suggest that Indian travellers\u2019 total expenditure will surge to $410 billion by 2030. This will position India as the fourth-largest travel market.\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), an online travel booking company, is, therefore, an interest bet for multibagger returns. With the industry recovering after the pandemic, MMYT stock has surged by 175% in the last 12 months. I would look at corrections to accumulate with a long-term investment horizon.\n\nIn terms of fundamentals, MakeMyTrip achieved the highest ever gross annual booking for the financial year 2024. Revenue growth will likely remain healthy. At the same time, there has been a significant improvement at the operating level. In FY21, the travel booking company reported an operating loss of $18 million. For FY24, operating profit was $124.2 million. Margin expansion will likely sustain on the back of operating leverage.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) has been consolidating around $70,000 levels. This is a good opportunity to accumulate quality crypto stocks before the next big move. Among Bitcoin miners, Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) looks massively undervalued at a forward P/E of 16.5. With ambitious growth plans and strong fundamentals, RIOT stock is worth considering.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Riot\u2019s balance sheet was zero-debt. The Bitcoin miner reported a cash buffer (including digital assets) of $1.3 billion. Therefore, Riot has high financial flexibility for aggressive expansion.\n\nRecently, Riot proposed to acquireBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) at $2.3 per share. While the proposal was rejected, Riot is clearly looking at acquisitions to establish itself as the largest Bitcoin miner.\n\nRegarding organic growth, Riot ended Q1 with a hash rate capacity of 12.4EH/s. The company is targeting to boost capacity to 31.4EH/s by the end of the year. Further, the long-term target is to achieve a capacity of 100EH/s by 2027. Therefore, revenue and EBITDA growth will likely be robust in the coming years.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nAfter a big rally in the first half of 2021, Pinterest\u2019s (NYSE:PINS) stock was corrected sharply. The key reasons were tight monetary policies and lower growth estimates in a post-pandemic world. However, PINS stock has been revived, with an upside of 81% in the last 12 months. The proxy e-commerce player remains attractively valued and has the potential for significant upside in the long term.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Pinterest reported revenue growth of 23% on a year-on-year basis to $740 million. Further, global active users increased by 12% to 518 million. The company reported operating cash flow of $356 million, which implies an annualized OCF of $1.5 billion. This is a key reason for being bullish on PINS stock, and I expect cash flows to swell further.\n\nTo elaborate on the reason, Pinterest reported a global average revenue per user of $1.46 for Q1 2024. In the U.S. and Canada, the ARPU was $6.05. However, the ARPU was $0.86 and $0.11 for Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. I see ample scope for ARPU upside from emerging markets in the next five years. Even with a stable user base, this will translate into a cash flow upside.\n\nCronos (CRON) CRON stock: Glass jars filled with medicinal cannabis\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLet\u2019s end the discussion on growth stocks to buy and hold with a penny stock with immense potential. Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) stock is possibly the best way to bet on the cannabis sector growth.\n\nI like that Cronos has gone slow in expansion and preserved cash. The cannabis company ended Q1 2024 with a solid cash buffer of $855 million. With regulatory headwinds gradually declining, Cronos is among the best positioned companies from a financial perspective to go aggressive, including organic and possible acquisition-driven growth initiatives.\n\nOn the organic growth front, Cronos has a strong presence in Canada and Israel. In the last few quarters, the company has entered new geographies, including Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom. This is likely to support accelerated revenue growth.\n\nCronos will likely enter the United States with the impending reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule III drug. Additionally, there is a big addressable market for medicinal cannabis in multiple European countries. Also, the company\u2019s entry into Germany comes at the right time with cannabis legalization.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Think MakeMyTrip (MMYT) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about MakeMyTrip (MMYT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMakeMyTrip currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.36, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.36 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 14.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MMYT Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for MMYT\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for MakeMyTrip here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying MakeMyTrip, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs MMYT a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for MakeMyTrip, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $1.62.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for MakeMyTrip. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for MakeMyTrip may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "FLiRT Fears: 3 Travel Stocks to Buy on the Dip if Covid Variant Spikes",
        "content": "Travel stock investors might be flirting with danger with the likelihood of a spike in Covid FLiRT variants this summer. As cases related to the FLiRT variants rise globally, it\u2019s important to remain cautiously optimistic. However, on the dip, these travel stocks to buy could be strong.\n\nMy strategy would be to book profits in travel stocks that have surged in the last 18 to 24 months. If the FLiRT variants cause some panic selling, it would be a good time to look at quality travel stocks to buy.\n\nOf course, this entire strategy assumes that cases related to these variants spike significantly. However, it\u2019s also important to note that GDP growth in the U.S. has significantly decelerated in Q1 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf rate cuts are delayed, there is likely to be an impact on discretionary spending. It therefore makes sense to book profits in high-flying travel stocks and re-enter on possible correction within the next two quarters.\n\nTravel Stocks to Buy on the Dip: Booking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a quality blue-chip travel stock to buy on corrections. In the last 12 months, BKNK stock has gradually trended higher. However, valuations remain attractive with the stock trading at a forward P/E of 21.5. Any correction on FLiRT fears would be a golden opportunity to accumulate.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Booking Holdings reported healthy growth in gross booking by 10% on a year-on-year basis to $43.5 billion. Further, total revenue increased by 17% on a year-on-year basis to $4.4 billion. It\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets sold touch the highest level since Q1 2022.\n\nI must add here that Booking Holdings reported free cash flow of $2.6 billion for the quarter. This implies an annualized FCF potential of more than $10 billion. Therefore, there is ample flexibility for dividends and platform development. Overall, the business is a cash flow machine with low capital investments. BKNK stock is therefore worth accumulating on declines for the core portfolio.\n\nTripadvisor (TRIP) image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nTripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) stock has declined by 17% for year-to-date. Any potential surge in covid cases might translate into further weakness for TRIP stock. This would be a good opportunity to accumulate with the stock trading at an attractive forward P/E of 13.4.\n\nIn February, Tripadvisor had formed a special committee to evaluate potential merger and acquisition opportunities. The committee indicated in May that \u201cthere is no transaction with a third party that is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.\u201d This resulted in a sell-off for TRIP stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, leaving this aside, business developments remain positive. For Q1 2024, Tripadvisor reported revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 42% respectively. It\u2019s likely that healthy EBITDA margin expansion will sustain on the back of margin improvement for Viator and TheFork.\n\nFurther, Tripadvisor ended Q1 2024 with a liquidity buffer of $1.7 billion. As the special committee continues to evaluate opportunities, potential acquisition can boost top-line growth.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn March 2020, MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock had touched lows of $11.2. The rally has been significant from those levels with MMYT stock currently trading at $77. Considering the potential the Indian tourism industry holds, MMYT is likely to be a multibagger even from current levels. However, I would wait for some correction before fresh exposure.\n\nTalking about the market size, Indian travellers are expected to undertake five billion more trips by 2030. Further, the travel and tourism spend by Indians will be the fourth largest globally by the end of the decade at $410 billion. Clearly, there is a massive opportunity and MakeMyTrip is positioned to benefit as the company has a leading market share in online booking.\n\nSpecific to the company, profitability has been improving on a sustained basis. In financial year 2021, MakeMyTrip reported operating loss of $18 million. For FY24, operating profit was $124.2 million. With continued upside in gross bookings, I expect margin improvement to sustain. Make the right play and grab these travel stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "5 Must-Buy Mid-Cap Stocks With Strong Near-Term Potential",
        "content": "U.S. stock markets have witnessed renewed momentum in May after a brief halt in April. Market participants witnessed an impressive 15-month rally before April. The rebound in May has taken a section of financial experts by surprise as they warned of further downside due to higher stock valuations and the Fed\u2019s decision to keep interest rates higher for longer than expected.\n\nYear to date, the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have rallied 3.4%, 11.9% and 14.6%, respectively. The mid-cap benchmark \u2014 the S&P 400 Index \u2014 also advanced 7.4% year to date.\n\nWithin the mid-cap space, a handful of stocks (market capital > $8 billion< $10 billion) have the potential to become large caps in 2024. Investment in these stocks with the most favorable Zacks Rank should lead to handsome returns this year.\n\nWhy Should You Invest in Mid-Cap Stocks?\n\nInvestment in mid-cap stocks is often recognized as a good portfolio diversification strategy. These stocks combine the attractive attributes of both small and large-cap stocks. Top-ranked, mid-cap stocks have a high potential to enhance their profitability, productivity, and market share. These may also become large-caps over time.\n\nIf economic growth slows down due to any unforeseen internal or external disturbance, mid-cap stocks will be less susceptible to losses than their large-cap counterparts owing to less international exposure.\n\nOn the other hand, if the economy continues to thrive, these stocks will gain more than small caps due to established management teams, a broad distribution network, brand recognition and ready access to capital markets.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five mid-caps that have strong potential for 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.

        "content": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, MMYT crossed above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.\n\nThe 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.\n\nSimilar to other SMAs, if a stock's price moves above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive, while price falling below the moving average can signal a downward trend. Moving Average Chart for MMYT\n\nMMYT has rallied 17.4% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests MMYT could be on the verge of another move higher.\n\nLooking at MMYT's earnings estimate revisions, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. There have been 1 revisions higher for the current fiscal year compared to none lower, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nGiven this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on MMYT for more gains in the near future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Momentum Anomaly Picks as Inflation Fears Refuse to Abate",
        "content": "After witnessing one of the longest winning streaks since the beginning of 2024, the broader U.S. equity markets recorded a downward trajectory yesterday as the minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s May policy meeting reignited fears that the central bank might not cut interest rates in the near future. The minutes revealed that several Fed officials are of the view that although inflation has eased over the past year, it is yet to achieve the benchmark 2% level. Consequently, there is an increasing willingness to resort to stricter policy measures if inflation fails to move toward the coveted goal.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the markets were buoyed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments, which largely ruled out a central bank hike in its next policy meeting after holding the rates steady between 5.25% and 5.50% in May. This had fueled optimism regarding a probable interest rate cut, with investors even pricing in a second rate cut by the end of the year with a nearly 50% likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the shift in the Fed's stance, it has become tough to gauge the rate hike trajectory, forcing investors to wait for further clarity from other officials in the future. \r\n\r\nAmid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.\r\n\r\nThis approach primarily tends to follow the adage, \u201cthe trend is your friend.\u201d At its core, momentum investing is \u201cbuying high and selling higher.\u201d It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?\r\n\r\nThere are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.\r\n\r\nFor example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.\r\n\r\nIn this context, stocks like Southern Copper Corporation SCCO, M/I Homes, Inc. MHO and MakeMyTrip Limited MMYT are worth betting on.\r\n\r\nMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child\u2019s play.\r\n\r\nHere, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.\n\nStory continues\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.\r\n\r\nPercentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.\r\n\r\nZacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy Now for 20X Returns by 2030",
        "content": "The single biggest quality of an investor that can make him/her a millionaire is patience. With some research, it\u2019s not difficult to spot quality growth stocks to buy. However, I see that investors are increasingly tempted to sell after 100% or 200% gains and make a switch to another stock. However, investors who buy and hold with patience mint money in the long term. It\u2019s a matter of trade-off between instant and delayed gratification.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the markets have been in an uptrend. With the possibility of multiple rate cuts in the next 18 months, the rally is likely to sustain, amidst volatility. In my view, it\u2019s a good time to consider exposure to high-quality growth stocks. There is likely to be a period of sharp uptrend for these growth stock ideas in the coming quarters.\n\nOf course, there will be phases of correction. I, however, believe the companies discussed will continue to create value through 2030. With visibility for healthy revenue growth coupled with cash flow upside, these growth stocks to buy are poised for multi-fold returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) has corrected after weak Q1 2024 results. In my view, this is a good opportunity to buy, and LI stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the industry faces macroeconomic headwinds, and intense competition has impacted growth. However, Li Auto, with strong fundamentals and focus on innovation, will likely survive and gain market share. For Q1, the company reported R&D expenses of $422 million. That would imply an annual R&D investment of more than $1.5 billion.\n\nAn important point to note is that Li ended Q1 2024 with a robust cash buffer of $13.7 billion. Therefore, there is ample flexibility to invest in product development and continued retail expansion in China.\n\nI also like that Li Auto has continued to focus on one market. There is ample headroom for growth within China, the largest EV market in the world. Of course, global expansion is a likely next step forward. When that comes, deliveries growth will be supported.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) DraftKings website in browser with company logo\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nDraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a digital sports entertainment company with a big addressable market and positive financial metrics. The company is focused on the iGaming and online sports betting (OSB) market in the United States. Backed by positive business developments, DKNG stock has trended higher by 74% in the last 12 months. Intermediate corrections would be a good opportunity to accumulate this potential multibagger.\n\nStory continues\n\nDraftKings expects iGaming and OSB market size to increase from $20 billion in 2023 to $30 billion by 2028. This estimate is only for existing states. As new states legalize OSB and iGaming, the addressable market will swell. That puts into perspective the headroom for growth in the coming years.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for Q1 2024, the company reported a 53% upside in revenue to $1.2 billion. DraftKings has also increased its revenue guidance for the year to $4.9 billion, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $500 million.\n\nI must add that for Q1, average monthly unique payers increased to 3.4 million. For the same period, the average revenue per user was $114, higher by 25% on a year-on-year basis. ARPU growth points to sustained EBITDA margin expansion potential.\n\nCronos Group (CRON) Even Contrarian Investors Should Hold off on CRON Stock for Now\n\nEven without federal-level legalization, the U.S. cannabis market is expected to be worth $71 billion by 2030. Germany has recently legalized cannabis, and other European countries might follow suit. The medicinal cannabis market is also gaining traction in Europe. Overall, with a relative decline in regulatory headwinds, the outlook is positive for the cannabis industry.\n\nCronos (NASDAQ:CRON) is one of the best picks among cannabis stocks. CRON stock has been trending higher, and I expect the positive momentum to sustain from deeply oversold levels. One reason to like Cronos is its strong fundamentals. The company ended Q1 2024 with a cash buffer of $855 million. That provides ample flexibility to pursue organic and acquisition-driven growth.\n\nFor Q1 2024, the company reported healthy revenue growth of 30% on a year-on-year basis to $25.3 million. I expect revenue growth to accelerate as Cronos makes inroads into new geographies. Initially, the company was focused on Canada and Israel. However, in 2023, Cronos entered Germany and Australia with its medicinal cannabis offerings. Recently, the company entered the United Kingdom with its first shipment of cannabis flowers.\n\nMiniso Group Holding (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nMiniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) is a deeply undervalued growth stock to buy for multibagger returns. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 18.7 and offers a dividend yield of 1.80%. Considering the expansion plans of this lifestyle retailer, I expect a big breakout rally. It\u2019s worth mentioning at the onset that Miniso differentiates itself through a dynamic lifestyle product portfolio and attractive pricing.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Miniso reported healthy revenue growth of 26% on a year-on-year basis to $515.7 million. For the same period, the company reported adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 200 basis points to 25.9%. The company\u2019s growth was driven by aggressive retail store openings globally.\n\nMiniso continues to have aggressive expansion plans. Between 2024 and 2028, the company expects to open 900 to 1,100 stores annually. During the same period, Miniso is targeting revenue growth at a CAGR of over 20%. With operating leverage, EBITDA margin expansion will likely sustain. As cash flows swell, the company will be positioned to increase dividends.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp on screen\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf I had to buy only one lithium stock, it would be Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC). At a market valuation of $924 million, the company\u2019s shares are a steal, and I expect multibagger returns from current levels. Of course, the basic assumption is that lithium will trend higher in the long term. That\u2019s very likely considering the impending demand-supply gap.\n\nAs an overview, Lithium Americas is the owner of the Thacker Pass lithium asset in the United States. Thacker Pass has a mine life of 40 years with an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Further, once both phases commence production, the average annual EBITDA from the asset is likely at $2 billion. Clearly, it\u2019s a potential cash flow machine.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning here that in March, the company received a conditional commitment for a $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. Recently, the company raised $275 million through an underwritten public offering. This will likely ensure the construction of the Thacker Pass asset is not hampered due to financial constraints.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong quality e-commerce stocks to buy, Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) is worth considering. The Korean company has been delivering strong numbers and expanding its addressable market. It\u2019s not surprising that UBS believes that Coupang will continue to increase sales, market share and margins.\n\nFor Q1 2024, Coupang reported revenue growth of 23% on a year-on-year basis to $7.1 billion. For the same period, gross profit margin increased by 260 basis points to 27.1%. I must add that for the last 12 months, Coupang has reported free cash flow of $1.5 billion. That provides high flexibility for aggressive investments.\n\nWhile there is ample headroom for growth within Korea, Coupang is pursuing international expansion. The focus is on emerging Asia and Southeast Asia. Further, with the acquisition of Farfetch Holdings, the company has made inroads in the global luxury retail market. Therefore, as the addressable market gets bigger, revenue growth acceleration is likely coupled with continued upside in cash flows.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed by 200% in the last 12 months. However, I would still consider buying on corrections with the company having immense growth potential.\n\nAs an overview, MakeMyTrip is the largest player in the online travel booking market in India. The company\u2019s services include air ticketing and holiday booking, among others.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that Indians could be the fourth-largest global travel spenders by 2030. That estimate looks realistic considering the point that India will add 140 million middle-income and 50 million high-income households by 2030. As a leading player, MakeMyTrip is positioned to benefit.\n\nSpecific to the company, the adjusted operating loss for the financial year 2021 was $18 million. With the tourism industry almost back to pre-pandemic levels, MakeMyTrip reported an operating profit of $124.2 million for FY24.\n\nStellar revenue growth will likely sustain, coupled with an upside in operating margin. I must add here that MakeMyTrip has a strong balance sheet with a cash buffer of $608 million. That provides flexibility for potential acquisitions to boost market share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Now The Time To Look At Buying MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT)?",
        "content": "While MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) might not have the largest market cap around , it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company's trading levels have reached its high for the past year, following the recent bounce in the share price. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today we will analyse the most recent data on MakeMyTrip\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MakeMyTrip\n\nIs MakeMyTrip Still Cheap?\n\nMakeMyTrip appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 45.13x is currently well-above the industry average of 18.89x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since MakeMyTrip\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\nWhat does the future of MakeMyTrip look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. MakeMyTrip's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in MMYT\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe MMYT should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MMYT for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for MMYT, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into MakeMyTrip, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

        "title": "Here's Why MakeMyTrip (MMYT) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy",
        "content": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at MakeMyTrip (MMYT), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. MakeMyTrip currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if MMYT is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this online travel company holds up.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor MMYT, shares are up 3.61% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry is up 0.86% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 35.92% compares favorably with the industry's 8.51% performance as well.\n\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of MakeMyTrip have risen 48.73%, and are up 224.6% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.91% and 30.04%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to MMYT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. MMYT is currently averaging 776,378 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MMYT.\n\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MMYT's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.46 to $1.60 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that MMYT is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep MakeMyTrip on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Leading up to the peak travel season this summer, Panama-based airlines operator Copa Holdings CPA and India-based online travel service company MakeMyTrip Limited MMYT are two stocks investors may want to keep an eye on.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at why now may be a good time to buy both of these travel-related stocks ahead of their quarterly results on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nCopa Holdings Preview\n\nImpressive operating margins attributed to low unit cost and healthy travel demand helped Copa Holdings' post-industry-leading financial results last year. Through its subsidiaries Copa Airlines and Copa Columbia, the company has become a regional leader among airlines in South America with destinations to and from North and Central America and the Caribbean along with its Panama City hub.\n\nComing off of a very tough-to-compete-against prior-year quarter, Copa Holdings\u2019 Q1 sales are projected to dip -3% to $837.31 million with earnings forecasted at $3.09 per share compared to EPS of $3.99 a year ago. Still, Copa Holdings has surpassed bottom line expectations for 12 consecutive quarters most recently beating Q4 earnings estimates by 14% in February with EPS at $4.47 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $3.90 a share.\n\nWhat also makes Copa Holdings' robust bottom line attractive ahead of its quarterly report is that CPA trades at just 6.4X forward earnings which is a significant discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 21.9X and the Zacks Transportation-Airline Industry average of 18.4X. Compared to the top regional airlines in the United States this is well below Southwest Airlines LUV at 24.6X and slightly beneath Alaska Air Group ALK and Delta Air Lines DAL at 9.3X and 7.9X respectively.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMakeMyTrip Limited Preview\n\nOutside of offering exposure to India\u2019s economy, MakeMyTrip Limited also serves the United States with its services and products extending to air tickets, customized holiday packages, hotel bookings, train and bus tickets along with car hire and access to travel insurance.\n\nSet to report its fiscal fourth quarter results on Wednesday, MakeMyTrip Limited\u2019s expansion remains compelling with Q4 sales thought to have increased 31% to $195.15 million. Even better, earnings are projected to increase 24% to $0.26 per share versus $0.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Notably, MakeMyTrip Limited has surpassed earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports with Q3 EPS of $0.35 most recently beating estimates of $0.30 a share by 16% in January. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory continues\n\nAttractive Growth Trajectories\n\nCopa Holdings' total sales are expected to increase 7% in both fiscal 2024 and FY25 with projections edging towards $4 billion. Annual earnings are projected to dip -3% this year but are forecasted to rebound and rise 9% in FY25 to $17.70 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeanwhile, MakeMyTrip Limited\u2019s total sales are slated to expand 33% in FY24 to $787.71 million compared to $593.04 million last year. MakeMyTrip Limited\u2019s top line is expected to jump another 18% next year with projections at $934.78 million. More importantly, annual earnings are forecasted to soar 139% in FY24 to $1.15 per share versus $0.48 a share in 2023. Furthermore, another 39% EPS growth is expected in FY25 with projections at $1.60 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nCopa Holdings and MakeMyTrip Limited have emerged as winners amid the continued post-pandemic recovery in the broader travel industry. To that point, going into their quarterly reports Copa Holdings stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while MakeMyTrip Limited shares boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Travel demand is accelerating with major sector names reporting strong demand ahead of the key holiday period, underscoring the potential of airline stocks to buy before summer. Last week, Booking.com said it expects to see strong travel demand despite the slowdown in certain regions, namely the Middle East.\n\nBooking.com said it expects room-night growth to increase between 4% and 6% year-over-year. Moreover, the gross travel bookings are expected to rise 3-5%. Overall, the company\u2019s\u00a0 first-quarter results indicated strong demand, particularly in Europe, which is the key market for this company.\n\nAccording to Airports Council International (ACI) World, the global air passenger volume is now near pre-pandemic levels. The first bi-annual air travel demand update of 2024 indicates that the current projection for global passenger volume in 2023 stands at approximately 8.7 billion.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis figure represents 95% of the 2019 level, marking a 31% year-on-year growth from the volume recorded in 2022. The estimates provided by ACI World are based on comprehensive data drawn from over 2,600 airports in more than 180 countries and territories.\n\nAccording to the World Airport Traffic Forecasts (WATF) 2023\u20132052, the baseline scenario before the COVID-19 pandemic estimated that global passenger volume would hit 10.5 billion in 2023, which is 119% of the 2019 level. However, the current projection falls short of this pre-COVID-19 baseline scenario, yet it still shows significant recovery.\n\nBy October 2023, total passenger traffic had risen by 28% year-on-year, reaching 93% of the October 2019 year-to-date level. The domestic market saw a 21% increase from the previous year, achieving 97% of the 2019 figures, while the international market led the recovery with a 38% year-on-year growth, reaching 88% of the 2019 level.\n\nLooking forward, global passenger traffic in 2024 is expected to exceed the 2019 figures for the first time since the onset of COVID-19. The forecast predicts a total of 9.7 billion passengers, which is 106% of the 2019 level, with a 12% year-on-year growth rate. However, the growth rate is anticipated to slow down in the following years as the market stabilizes from the pandemic\u2019s impact.\n\nHere we take a look at the three hottest airline stocks to buy before the summer season.\n\nBooking.com (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a leading online travel agency known for offering a wide range of travel services, including accommodations, flights, car rentals, and restaurant reservations.\n\nStory continues\n\n89% of the company\u2019s total revenue comes from non-US travel, which makes it a key beneficiary of strong demand for international travel. Booking.com reported that room nights booked in the three months ending March 31 grew by 9% to 297 million, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nGross travel bookings reached $43.5 billion, also surpassing projections, and the company\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $898 million, well above the expected $718.6 million.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share were reported at $20.39, compared to the $13.98 estimate by analysts. Furthermore, the board declared a cash dividend of $8.75 per share, payable on June 28.\n\nShares of Booking Holdings rose by 5.3%, climbing to $3,657.09 from a previous close of $3,472.91 after analysts raised their price targets, reflecting renewed confidence in the company\u2019s growth prospects.\n\nBooking.com stock is up by 9% year-to-date.\n\nRyanair (RYAAY) An image of a pilot walking out of a large white, blue, and yellow Ryanair plane.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRyanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY), a prominent low-cost airline based in Ireland, specializes in budget travel across Europe and to select international destinations. Known for its cost-effective pricing model, Ryanair facilitates international travel by connecting a vast network of routes, making it a popular choice for travelers seeking affordable options. As such, it stands out as one of the top airline stocks to buy before summer.\n\nRyanair recently announced a significant expansion plan that will introduce 169 new routes, expanding its network to a total of 2,600 routes across Europe and North Africa, positioning itself as a key player in the global travel industry.\n\nThis growth strategy includes the launch of domestic operations in Morocco, where the airline will connect 11 different destinations. With the aviation industry facing reduced schedules due to ongoing Pratt & Whitney engine issues affecting several major airlines, Ryanair anticipates a sustained demand for air travel.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) MakeMyTrip (MMYT) - Airline Stocks to Buy Before Summer\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an Indian online travel company providing travel products and solutions. Founded in 2000, it offers services like flight tickets, domestic and international holiday packages, hotel reservations, and rail and bus tickets, making it a comprehensive travel portal in India\u2019s rapidly growing travel market.\n\nA few months ago, MakeMyTrip reported all-time high quarterly gross bookings, revenue and net profit for its third fiscal quarter. The firm\u2019s net profit soared to $24.2 million, a massive rise from the $0.2 million reported in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n\nRevenue under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) climbed by 26.9% in constant currency terms to $214.2 million, up from $170.5 million in the same period last fiscal year. The operating level saw EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, leap by 105.6% to $29.4 million, compared to $14.3 million in the prior year\u2019s corresponding quarter.\n\nThe gross bookings for MakeMyTrip experienced a year-on-year increase of 21.7% in constant currency, reaching $2.088 billion in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, up from $1.738 billion in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "MakeMyTrip Co-Founder and Group CEO, Rajesh Magow, at Skift India Summit. Skift\n\nIndian online travel agency MakeMyTrip will be resuming its attractions and activities product for travelers, a feature it had paused during the Covid pandemic.\n\nMakeMyTrip Co-Founder and Group CEO, Rajesh Magow, emphasized that these experiences are currently more focused on foreign destinations, as the offerings for domestic destinations are still developing.\n\nThat was one bit of news Magow shared in an interview with Skift. We were also interested in what trends he\u2019s seeing as he leads India\u2019s largest online travel agency.\n\nSkift: On news of MakeMyTrip making its products available from 3 to 150 countries, what prompted this move?\n\nMagow: It\u2019s not so much about going global as it is about increasing accessibility to a wider audience. This will help us reach the vast Indian diaspora and enable us to cater to a broader audience, fostering increased inbound travel to India.\n\nTravelers for now would be able to transact only in INR, AED and USD, but work is in progress to allow multi-currency transactions.\n\nShift in Spending Patterns\n\nMakeMyTrip recently launched the Business Class Funnel. How has the consumption patterns of Indians changed and how do you plan to cater to this demand for premium travel experiences?\n\nThis product targeting travelers on long-haul flights or those taking a red-eye, is in its early stages, but it\u2019s gaining momentum. There\u2019s a marked shift in spending patterns. Currently, essential expenses account for 80% of spending, while 20% is for discretionary purposes. By 2030, this ratio is expected to shift to 60:40, doubling discretionary spending.\n\nLooking ahead to 2030, approximately 90 million Indian households will be led by millennials. With increasing incomes and a preference for enhanced experiences over savings, this demographic is influencing consumer behavior. India\u2019s economic evolution also merits attention, positioning the country for a transformation similar to what China experienced.\n\nImpact of Short Booking Windows\n\nNow that summer is here, MakeMyTrip has also gone on air with its recent summer campaign. What are the emerging travel trends? Have booking windows become longer?\n\nIndia is a last-minute market, where bookings are typically made 15 to 30 days in advance. It\u2019s still early days for summer booking trends. However, weekend getaways are becoming popular and seem to be a permanent trend. Whenever there\u2019s a holiday during the week, closer to the weekend, people book trips promptly, and booking windows for these are shorter.\n\nBooking windows are longer when schools and colleges announce summer vacations, which is the time for families to book trips. Earlier this month, our packages unit held a sale event, which generated significant interest. People saw attractive prices and were willing to book in advance. Such events also help trigger longer booking windows.\n\nStory continues\n\nComplying With New Tax-Collection Rules\n\nIs there more clarity on Tax Collected at Source (TCS) for travelers now?\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that TCS is not an additional tax and is more of a temporary cash flow concern. Banks are responsible for collecting the tax, not travel agents as they have more accurate information. If you use a credit card for other foreign purchases, we cannot monitor that.\n\nTo manage expenditures beyond the INR 700,000 ($8,384) limit, we have integrated APIs from banks that inform us whether a specific credit card has exceeded the liberalized remittance scheme (LRS) or spending limit.\n\nHowever, the INR 700,000 limit has proven effective, and people are getting accustomed to it.\n\nGrowth in Religious Tourism\n\nHow does MakeMyTrip look at the religious tourism segment? How do you plan to tap into this?\n\nReligious tourism is a rapidly growing segment driven by improved connectivity and enhanced overall experiences. People today visit these places not just for religious purposes, but also to seek historical and cultural experiences.\n\nIndividuals from all income brackets \u2014 lower, middle, and high \u2014 are now exploring these destinations. As infrastructure gradually improves, there are challenges. Ayodhya recently generated substantial interest, but the hospitality sector there is still catching up, resulting in a supply-demand gap. In hindsight, the hospitality industry could have been more proactive in developing accommodations to meet this demand.\n\nThere\u2019s also a need to focus on enhancing the overall tourist experience. Road, rail, and air connectivity is improving, and more hotels and homestays are expected to emerge. However, on-ground experiences, such as sightseeing and queue management at sites, require procedural and logistical improvements.\n\nAs demand continues to grow and infrastructure development progresses, there will likely be a greater emphasis on improving experiences. Such improvements have already been seen in established religious destinations like Katra, Tirupati and Shirdi.\n\nBringing Travelers From Smaller Cities\n\nMakeMyTrip recently integrated its hotel product on the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) website. Is this an effort to attract new users from smaller cities and expand the customer base?\n\nThat\u2019s correct. IRCTC is deeply penetrated in the Indian interiors. The idea behind this initiative was to utilize our existing content by making it accessible to IRCTC\u2019s audience, thereby attracting new users to our platform.\n\nBy featuring our hotel offerings on IRCTC, we increase our visibility among their audience. This allows users who encounter our services on IRCTC to easily transition to booking through our platform if they wish to do so.\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The market expects MakeMyTrip (MMYT) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 15. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis online travel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.8%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $195.15 million, up 31.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 29.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MakeMyTrip?\n\nFor MakeMyTrip, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MakeMyTrip will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that MakeMyTrip would post earnings of $0.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nMakeMyTrip doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights GoDaddy, Vipshop  MakeMyTrip and Asure Software",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 , 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses GoDaddy GDDY, Vipshop Holdings VIPS, MakeMyTrip MMYT and Asure Software ASUR.\n\nIndustry: Internet Delivery Services\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2269505/4-internet-delivery-services-stocks-to-watch-despite-industry-woes\n\nPersistent macroeconomic uncertainties, protracted inflationary conditions and still-high interest rates are challenges for many players within the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry. Moreover, elevated operating expenses related to hiring new employees and sales and marketing strategies to capture more market share are likely to strain margins in the near term. Additionally, as expansion into newer markets will take some time to generate volumes, higher upfront costs might erode profitability.\n\nDespite these challenges, industry participants like GoDaddy, Vipshop Holdings, MakeMyTrip and Asure Software are strategically positioned for growth due to their sustained efforts toward adopting changing consumer preferences. A greater Internet presence in emerging markets, a burgeoning affluent middle class and the accelerated uptake of smartphones are set to aid Internet \u2013 Delivery Services industry participants. Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry primarily comprises companies that offer services via Internet-based platforms. These include food delivery, online travel booking, direct marketing and media services and web hosting, among others. Some companies in this space offer Internet domain registration and web hosting registration and sell e-business-related software and services.\n\nA few industry participants provide air and train ticket bookings, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, bus tickets and car hire services. Some players offer online direct marketing and media services, including online messaging, email broadcasting, search engine marketing and brand management facilities. Growth-stage companies in the industry are spending more on R&D and sales & marketing, making it difficult for them to generate profits in the near term.\n\nTrends Shaping the Future of the Internet - Delivery Services Industry\n\nSmartphones & Internet Penetration Act as Key Catalysts: The Internet is ubiquitous, and the heightening usage of smartphones is changing the delivery landscape. The companies in the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry are benefiting from the growing number of Internet users, coupled with an improvement in Internet penetration and the rapid adoption of the 4G Volte technology. The emergence of 5G technology, which promises faster speed and deliverability, also bodes well for this industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting Consumer Preferences: The shift in consumer preferences, driven by convenience and easy accessibility, is anticipated to aid the industry. The accelerated transition from offline to online food ordering, as well as the rising penetration of online travel booking, augurs well for industry players. However, as the higher consumer spending appetite is the main driver of the overall industry\u2019s health, any sluggishness in the global economy will pose a risk.\n\nTechnological Advancements: Advances in technology, including route optimization algorithms, GPS tracking and real-time delivery updates, have enhanced the efficiency and reliability of Internet delivery services. These technological innovations improve delivery accuracy and reduce transit times.\n\nHigher Upfront Costs to Hurt Profitability: Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth. However, higher upfront costs related to expansion strategies might erode profitability. Moreover, Amazon\u2019s focus on strengthening its delivery system is a key challenge for the industry players.\n\nWe believe the company\u2019s powerful distribution channels are a major force that might highly threaten incumbents in this industry. Also, the search giant, Alphabet, has forayed into the food delivery market with its delivery arm, Wing, and an array of food delivery apps, which are likely to intensify competition.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects\n\nThe Internet - Delivery Services industry is housed within the broader Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #179, which places it among the bottom 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative aggregate earnings outlook for the constituent companies.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the industry\u2019s performance and current valuation.\n\nIndustry Outperforms the S&P 500 and the Sector\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery industry has outperformed the S&P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector over the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 57.8% during this period, while the S&P 500 and the broader sector have advanced 24.5% and 40%, respectively.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Internet-Delivery stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.16X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 3.86X and the sector\u2019s 4.71X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.34X and as low as 0.57X and recorded a median of 0.89X.\n\n4 Stocks in Focus\n\nGoDaddy: It is an Internet domain registrar and web hosting company that also sells e-business-related software and services. The company is engaged in designing and developing cloud-based technology products for small businesses, web design professionals and individuals. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nGoDaddy is benefiting from strong momentum across the Applications & Commerce business and its expanding global footprint. Strength in Create & Grow solutions is aiding the Application & Commerce segment\u2019s top-line growth. Website plus marketing, driven by greater engagement with customers based on new product launches, is contributing well.\n\nStrong renewals & registrations and the expansion of the GoDaddy Registry are major catalysts. Growth in bookings, primarily driven by strong customer additions and price increases in various domains, has been a key catalyst.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 16 cents to $4.92 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nVipshop Holdings: It is an online discount retailer for brands. The company offers branded products to consumers in China through flash sales on its vipshop.com website.\n\nThe company\u2019s continued efforts toward strengthening product offerings and improving product procurement are aiding its financial performance, given the growing proliferation of online shopping. Further, the solid execution of its merchandising strategy is bolstering its active customer base. Moreover, its successful transition to discount retailing is a major upside. This is likely to continue driving momentum across repeat customers and help attract new ones.\n\nAdditionally, this Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s quarterly results are likely to keep benefiting from its deepening focus on high-margin-generating apparel-related businesses, especially the discount apparel business. Furthermore, Vipshop\u2019s deep discount channels are expected to bolster its online gross merchandise volumes in the quarters ahead.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised a penny downward to $2.54 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nMakeMyTrip: It is an online travel service company that offers travel products and solutions in India and the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 company's services and products include air tickets, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, railway tickets, bus tickets and car hire. It also facilitates access to travel insurance.\n\nMakeMyTrip is gaining substantially from improving travel conditions and the reopening of economies post-pandemic. In addition, recovering hotel demand as a result of the rise in short-stay getaway vacations, great travel deals and hygienically safe properties is a major upside. Also, the company is optimistic about its cost-control initiatives, MySafety and GoSafe programs, and strengthening hotel business.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised downward to $1.13 per share from $1.17 in the past 60 days.\n\nAsure Software: This is a cloud computing firm that offers business clients the chance to modernize everything from human capital management (HCM) and time & attendance solutions to payroll and taxes. Asure Software\u2019s strategic initiative to become a pure software-as-a-service HCM company is aiding its top-line growth. This Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s focus on driving innovation for its HCM solutions is helping it expand its footprint in the HCM market.\n\nNew client additions and a continued focus on cross-selling to existing clients are driving Asure Software\u2019s revenues. The company\u2019s differentiated employee strategy, measurement capabilities and comprehensive product offerings are helping it win new customers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asure Software\u2019s 2024 earnings has remained unchanged at 69 cents per share in the past 60 days.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS) shares ended the last trading session 7.2% higher at $16.06. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 14.3% loss over the past four weeks.\n\nVipshop extended its rally, driven by the solid execution of its merchandising strategy. Further, the company\u2019s deepening focus on high-margin apparel-related businesses, especially the discount apparel business, remains a positive.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.7%. Revenues are expected to be $3.87 billion, down 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Vipshop, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on VIPS going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

One other stock in the same industry, MakeMyTrip (MMYT), finished the last trading session 4.4% higher at $70.47. MMYT has returned -6.3% over the past month.\n\nFor MakeMyTrip , the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has remained unchanged over the past month at $0.24.

        "title": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's What You Should Know",
        "content": "MakeMyTrip (MMYT) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for MakeMyTrip is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for MakeMyTrip imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for MakeMyTrip\n\nThis online travel company is expected to earn $1.13 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 135.4%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for MakeMyTrip. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of MakeMyTrip to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "No stock can become a high-flyer overnight.\n\nIt takes years and steady revenue growth for them to reach the peaks. Smart investors are aware of the fact that identifying under-the-radar stocks on time could lead to impressive returns in the long term.\n\nTechnology is one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy. It has led to massive gains for investors over the past year. The large-cap tech stocks always gain attention but then there are a few little-known tech stocks that can outperform the market. Being able to identify such stocks and look beyond the traditional big names could benefit long-term investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are the three under-appreciated stocks to add to your buy list.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Beautiful beach. Chairs on the sandy beach near the sea. Summer holiday and vacation concept for tourism. Inspirational tropical landscape. Tranquil scenery, relaxing beach, tropical landscape design. SLNA stock\n\nSource: icemanphotos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndia-based MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is up 175% in the past 12 months and 47% year-to-date (YTD). Trading at $68 today, the stock has a significant upside potential driven by the travel boom in the country.\n\nIndia is one of the fastest-growing economies and will\u00a0continue to\u00a0remain one for the next five years. Driven by high purchasing power and a growing middle class, the tourism sector will see a significant surge in spending.\n\nIf MakeMyTrip manages to benefit fro this massive opportunity, it could become one of the biggest travel stocks over the decade. Currently, MMYT dominates in the Indian travel market, often using special offers and discounts to attract users.\n\nIn 2023, the company saw the\u00a0highest-ever annual gross bookings which was up by 122% year-over-year (YOY). Then, it reported a profit of $5.4 million in Q4, up from the loss reported in the same quarter the previous year. The upcoming summer will see a surge in travel. So expect the same reflected in the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nEstimates indicate that 43% of\u00a0Indians are planning to take a trip this year. Furthermore, an\u00a0American Express (NYSE:AXP)\u00a0report highlights that 62% of\u00a0Indians plan to spend more on travel compared to the 40% global average.\n\nDriven by the rapid expansion of the economy, we can expect MakeMyTrip to show accelerated growth.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An Apollo self-driving car from Baidu drives around California.. BIDU stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite China and U.S. geopolitical tensions, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is an under-the-radar stock because of its artificial intelligence (AI) prowess.\n\nBaidu has been integrating AI into its services at a rapid pace. Its chatbot known as Ernie already attracts 200 million daily users.\n\nBIDU is expanding its quantum computing sector and investing in R&D spending on research and development. Recently, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Baidu sealed a deal where Baidu will offer its Chinese maps to Tesla\u00a0for the development of\u00a0its full self-driving vehicle.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact, Baidu is one of the 20 Chinese entities with top-level map surveying qualifications So, the stock popped after this announcement. BIDU is up 5% in the week and is exchanging hands for $111.\n\nEven Apple held talks with Baidu for the\u00a0usage of AI for its devices in China. But no confirmation has come through yet. A drop in sales in China and growing competition could have led to Apple considering working with a Chinese company to accelerate AI in its models.\n\nOverall, Baidu stock is down 9% YTD and 11% in the past 12 months. However, Baidu\u2019s AI investment and the Tesla deal could help revenue growth.\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California.

Due to the massive amount of data needed for AI applications, Pure Storage\u2019s products will continue to dominate the industry.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the company saw a rise in the subscription revenue. And it has a strong outlook for fiscal 2025. After beating estimates, the management guided for a double-digit percentage rate improvement in operating income and revenue.\n\nFor the\u00a0full year, its revenue came in at $2.8 billion and the subscription revenue stood at $1.2 billion, up 26% YOY. It ended the year with outstanding performance obligations worth $2.3 billion, up 31% YOY.\n\nThe stock is already up 127% in the 12 months and 50% YTD. It has set momentum for the year and the upcoming results could\u00a0give it a boost. This under-the-radar stock can hit record highs.\n\nIf you think there are better AI stocks around, you are not wrong. Pure Storage isn\u2019t the hottest AI stock, but it has potential to generate impressive gains.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Indian Stocks That Can Double Before the End of 2025",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund has raised India\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 6.8% for 2024 (financial year 2025). Further, growth is expected to remain robust at 6.5% for 2025. With favorable policies and a rising working-age population, the Indian economy is positioned for healthy growth through the decade. I would, therefore, look at exposure to undervalued Indian stocks for robust returns.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that portfolio diversification is important for capital preservation and healthy returns. A key aspect of portfolio diversification for the next decade is exposure to emerging markets. GDP growth in emerging markets will be meaningfully higher than in developed markets.\n\nThis column focuses on three undervalued Indian stocks that can double before the end of 2025. I believe these stocks are worth holding for the next five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons for being bullish on these stories.\n\nHDFC Bank (HDB) HDFC Bank storefront and logo\n\nSource: Rahul Ramachandram / Shutterstock.com\n\nHDFC Bank (NYSE:HDB) is among the most undervalued Indian banking sector stocks to buy. HDB stock has declined by 17% in the last 12 months. However, the downside seems to be capped from current levels for this 1.2% dividend yield stock.\n\nMy view is underscored by the point that out of 42 analysts covering the bank, 88% have a buy rating and 12% hold rating. Further, the low-price target is $58.3, which is equal to the current market price. On the other hand, the most bullish estimate is for a price target of $86.7. This would imply a rally of almost 50% from current levels.\n\nAn important point to note is that India is likely to remain among the fastest-growing economies in the world. The banking sector is the backbone of economic growth, the basis of the bull thesis for HDFC Bank.\n\nI must add that the bank continues to report stable asset quality. Further, the capital adequacy ratio is healthy at 18.8%. If inflation declines and policymakers cut rates, it will be a key catalyst for robust credit growth.\n\nWNS Holdings Limited (WNS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWNS Holdings (NYSE:WNS) stock has witnessed a sharp correction of 50% in the last 12 months. With WNS stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 9.7, this seems like a good buying opportunity.\n\nAs an overview, WNS Holdings is a business process management company. For fiscal year 2024, WNS clocked revenue of $1.3 billion, which was higher by 8.1% yearly. While WNS stock has plunged, the company added nine new clients in Q4 2024 and expanded its relationship with 40 existing clients.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn important point is that WNS has focused on aggressively investing in AI and Generative AI. This is likely to help WNS retail clients.\n\nFurther, macroeconomic headwinds have impacted client budgets globally. With the possibility of rate cuts in 2024 and 2025, I expect GDP growth acceleration to be positive for WNS. The stock downside is, therefore, a good accumulation opportunity at a valuation gap.\n\nYatra Online (YTRA) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nLet me end with a micro-cap stock discussion. Yatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA) is an undervalued online travel and tourism operator in India. YTRA stock has declined by 29% in the last 12 months and looks poised for a strong reversal rally.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is India\u2019s largest online travel company. However, MMYT stock has surged 180% in the last 12 months and valuations look stretched. On the other hand, YTRA stock seems to be underrated, but the downside is capped at current levels.\n\nA big reason to like Yatra is that the company has positioned itself as a leading player in the corporate travel market. Yatra has 8,000 big corporate clients and an addressable employee base of over seven million. This sets the company apart from its peers and provides ample headroom for growth.\n\nAt the same time, Yatra has initiated investments and focused on the business-to-consumer market. In this segment, the company directly competes with MakeMyTrip. Indians will be the fourth largest spenders on travel and tourism by 2030. With a big market, there is ample scope for growth for multiple players.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Tourism Stocks to Buy for 100% Returns by 2025",
        "content": "The tourism sector was among the worst impacted due to the Covid19 pandemic. However, as global travel and tourism now booms, tourism stocks are hot favorites. This view holds true for the short term as well as the long term.\n\nIn fact, international tourism ended 2023 at 88% of pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, international tourism hit $1.4 trillion last year. The estimates are rosy for 2024 even with macroeconomic headwinds.\n\nAdditionally, potential rate cuts are expected toward the end of 2024 and in 2025. This will have a positive impact on global growth. Therefore, many expect 2025 to be another good year for travel and tourism.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith positive industry tailwinds, let\u2019s explore three tourism stocks likely to double before the end of 2025.\n\nExpedia Group (EXPE) building facade with expedia (EXPE) group logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpedia Group (NASDAQ:EXPE) is among the deeply undervalued tourism stocks to buy. Even after a rally of 41% in the last six months, it trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 11. With the likelihood of strong quarterly numbers, I am bullish on the stock doubling before the end of 2025.\n\nExpedia Group operates as an online travel company with impressive global presence. The company has made a strong comeback after the pandemic, and Q4 2023 was the highest even fourth quarter revenue.\n\nFurther, for the full year, revenue increased by 10% to $12.8 billion. For the same period, adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% to $2.7 billion. With operating leverage, it\u2019s likely that EBITDA margin expansion will sustain this year.\n\nNotably, Expedia Group has been aggressively adding new partners to its global travel ecosystem. With positive industry tailwinds, EXPE is likely to accelerate growth in the coming years.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) two women carrying luggage in an airport\n\nSource: Shine Nucha / Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed in the last 12 months. However, the rally for this India-based online tourism company has been from deeply oversold levels. Considering the growth potential, I remain bullish on MMYT stock.\n\nImportantly, India is likely to be among the fastest growing economies. This is true not just for 2024, but for the next ten years. With favorable demographics coupled with a swelling middle-class, the tourism sector is poised for a boom.\n\nFurther, estimates indicate that Indian travelers are likely to embark on five billion more trips by 2030. And, spending on travel and tourism is expected to hit $410 billion by the end of the decade. Clearly, with a massive opportunity, MMYT stock is a potential multibagger.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors note a sustained improvement in operating margin post-pandemic. With healthy growth, this improvement is likely to continue, supporting the stock rally. Additionally, a leading position in the Indian online travel market positions MakeMyTrip for accelerated growth in the coming years.\n\nTripadvisor (TRIP) Closeup of iPhone Screen with TRIPADVISOR LOGO during Start screen\n\nSource: Mano Kors / Shutterstock.com\n\nTripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is another interesting pick among tourism stocks. The stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 17. With strong financials, the upside momentum for TRIP stock is likely to sustain.\n\nTripadvisor owns and operates a portfolio of travel media brands and businesses, including Tripadvisor, Viator and TheFork. For 2023, the company reported revenue and EBITDA of $1.8 billion and $334 million, respectively.\n\nIn fact, Tripadvisor brand reported EBITDA margin of 34% for the last financial year. Viator contributed to 38% of total revenue but didn\u2019t report any EBITDA profit or loss.\n\nOnce the Viator business margin swells, the impact on overall margin and cash flows will be significant. While Tripadvisor revenue growth was 7% year-over-year (YOY), Viator grew at 49%. Therefore, the best part of cash flow upside might be due for the company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 April 24, 2024 \u2013 Stocks in this week\u2019s article are MakeMyTrip Ltd. MMYT, Allison Transmission Holdings ALSN, Hess HES and BancFirst BANF.\n\n4 Stocks Backed by High Efficiency to Increase Portfolio Returns\n\nEfficiency level measures a company's capability to transform available input into output and is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits. A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.\n\nHowever, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:\n\nThese efficiency ratios are:\n\nReceivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company's potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the \"accounts receivable turnover ratio\" or \"debtor's turnover ratio\" is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.\n\nAsset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company's capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.\n\nInventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company's ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.\n\nOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company's ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.\n\nHere are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:\n\nMakeMyTrip Ltd. is an online travel service company that offers travel products and solutions in India and the United States. MMYT has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of nearly 67.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAllison Transmission Holdings is a manufacturer of fully-automatic transmissions for medium and heavy-duty commercial and heavy-tactical U.S. defense vehicles. ALSN has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 19.5%.\n\nHess is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. HES has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 17.5%.\n\nBancFirst is a bank holding company, focusing on providing a full range of commercial banking services to retail customers and small to medium-sized businesses both in the non-metropolitan trade centers and the metropolitan markets. BANF has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.9%.\n\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "content": "In this article, we shall discuss the 40 best places to visit in India before you die. To skip our detailed analysis of the tourism industry in India in 2024, go directly and see 10 Best Places to Visit in India Before You Die.\n\nAccording to figures by the \u00a0World Travel & Tourism Council, India is currently the tenth largest country in the world in terms of the travel and tourism industry's total contribution to the country's GDP, which currently stands north of $191.3 billion as of 2023. Moreover, the country's tourism sector is a critical source of foreign exchange, with India offering more than 40 UNESCO world heritage sites, 10 bio-geographic zones, 105 national parks, and 560 wildlife sanctuaries, many of which rank amongst some of the best places to visit in India before you die. India's travel agency business is severely dominated by MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), with more than 300,000 travel agent businesses facilitating seamless travel to some of the best places to visit in India, thereby representing the largest volumes of business in booking at about more than 52% of the travel market. These are heavily segmented across multiple diverse categories of service providers, like travel packages, cab, and bus booking companies. This segment is expected to reach more than $65 billion by 2027. The country's international tourist arrivals are expected to reach more than 30.5 million by 2028. These are increasingly optimistic figures, especially considering the fact that India was one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic as virtually all public movement in the country was restricted.\n\nZooming In On India's Economic Boom\n\nOur article on the 35 Most Visited Countries in the World in 2024 projects India to be one of the fastest growing tourist destinations for leisure-travel spendingby 2026, causing stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) to divert greater investments in India's bustling tourism market. According to a report by McKinsey, India's economic boom and staggering population growth lands it amongst an elite group of countries which are expected to deliver record international travel in the coming years, with the number of total trips skyrocketing from 13 million in 2022 to more than 80 million in 2040. This is supplemented by the fact that India is now the fifth largest economy in the world and its population, predominantly below the age of 25, has overtaken China to become the largest in the world with over 1.4 billion people.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting in the Indian Market Potential\n\nOur article on the 10 Best India ETFs sheds light upon the optimism surrounding India's economic boom which peaked investor interest in many India-focused ETFs like iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (BATS:SMIN), which tracks the investment results of the MSCI India Small Cap Index. The index comprises relatively small Indian companies in terms of market cap, thereby providing targeted access to the small cap segment of the Indian stock market. Over the past five years, the ETF is up 93.01% as of April 20.\u00a0 Introduced on February 8 2012, iShares MSCI India Small-Cap ETF (BATS:SMIN) holds net assets worth more than $858 million and a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2% as of April 20. Furthermore, as of April 20, it features a portfolio of 486 holdings with the most prominent ones being Voltas Ltd. (NSE:VOLTAS), Max Financial Services Ltd. (NSE:MSFL), and BSE Ltd. (NSE:BSE). Another ETF attracting positive investor interest is WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSE:EPI), which aims to provide investors with exposure to the broad Indian all cap equity of profitable enterprises with a value centric approach. With an expense ratio of 0.85%, the ETF's total assets are valued at $2.91 million as of April 20. Over the past year, the ETF is up 36.9% as of April 20. Some of the most prominent components in the ETF are Reliance Industries Ltd. (NSE:RELIANCE), ICICI Bank Ltd. (\n\nNYSE:IBN), and Coal India Ltd. (NSE:COALINDIA). As a result of these economic tailwinds, prominent travel stocks like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) are hoping to capitalize on India's economic growth wave and its expanding middle class.\n\nIndia's impressive economic gains have also resulted in infrastructural advancement, with enhanced air and road connectivity facilitating global demand for tourism to the best places to visit in India whilst driving sector-wide growth as well. For instance, one primary beneficiary of this advancement is the airline travel market in India, which was valued at $20 billion in 2020 and is projected to double in size by 2027 owing to advancements in airport infrastructure and increased access to passports. Massive demand for travel to the best places to visit in India before you die has led to major Indian airline carriers to place lucrative orders for more than 1100 jets and planes over the last couple of months. For instance, in June 2023, Indigo placed the largest commercial aircraft order in history for more than 500 Airbus A320 aircraft carriers which are to be delivered by 2030 to 2035. This development came in addition to Air India's massive deal to acquire more than 450 planes from Airbus and Boeing in the same month. According to Booking Holdings' (NASDAQ:BKNG) report 'How India Travels 2023', Indians are becoming increasingly inclined to shift away from conventional hotel settings to accommodations like apartments, villas, homestays, and other unique alternatives, leading to enormous upsides for companies like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB).\n\nEco-tourism in India: An Overview\n\nAccording to a report by KPMG, tailwinds from India's rampant tourism growth are expected to rub off on the country's growing services industry thereby facilitating long-term development. However, the report predicts that despite such an optimistic outlook, major companies operating within India's bustling tourism industry like Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and MakeMyTrip Ltd. (NASDAQ:MMYT) are under increasing pressure to adopt more climate-friendly alternatives owing to mounting concerns about climate change and the overall need for India to disassociate its impressive economic surge from greenhouse gas emissions. This is owing to the fact that despite having a relatively low per capita consumption rate when compared to some of the larger economies in the G20, India is projected to have one of the largest carbon footprints in the world in the next decade.\n\nWith an increase in travel and tourism in the country to some of the best places to visit in India before you die, India's per capita emissions are on the rise. As per the KPMG report, the industry is well-positioned to to generate revenues upwards of $59 billion by 2028. Moreover, India's sustainable tourism market was valued at more than $26.01 million in 2023 and is expected to reach $151.9 million by 2032 at a staggering CAGR of 19.3%. This meteoric rise sheds light upon the increasing pressure on the country's tourism industry to adopt responsible climate practices, with hotels and resorts resorting to solar, wind and geothermal energy sources in a bid to contain their carbon footprint. Eco-tourism is a critical segment of the global tourism industry and is expected to amount to more than $4.55 billion by 2027. For the fiscal year 2025, the government decided to allocate more than $29.3 million to develop sustainable tourism infrastructure, and promote adventure and religious tourism to some of the best places to visit in India before you die. According to India's G20 Sherpa and former CEO of NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant:\n\n\"We add a huge [carbon] footprint as we travel. India will attract 40-45 million tourists in the coming years and we should focus on enhancing the value per tourist rather than [the raw numbers]. By doing this we will be able to attract more companies and greater investment from around the world.\" Best Places to Visit in India Before You Die\n\nPhoto by Sylwia Bartyzel on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nIn order to determine the 40 best places to visit in India before you die, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources, including but not limited to travel blogs, news reports, and Reddit threads (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). We then shortlisted more than 70 places which appeared most frequently during our research. Since determining the quality of a travel destination is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria based on some of the most oft-cited priorities for tourists when picking a travel destination; the criteria is premised on each place's cultural or historical significance (25 points), natural or architectural beauty (20 points), and popularity amongst tourists (15 points). We then proceeded to award each place a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 40 places which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the cultural significance and natural or architectural beauty of the place.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "7 Under-The-Radar Growth Stocks to Buy for Multibagger Returns by 2030",
        "content": "Whenever I find good growth stock ideas for long term investing, I always check on the social media interest. There are stories being widely discussed with multibagger targets. While it does not imply that these ideas will not work, I prefer to invest in potential multibagger growth stocks that are not in the limelight.\n\nThese stocks represent companies with strong fundamentals and a positive industry outlook. Further, these ideas have gone unnoticed or the markets are currently ignoring them. As a result, these growth stocks trade at attractive valuations.\n\nThese ideas can deliver 10x to 20x returns by the end of the decade. Of course, I would review annual business developments, but the key is to hold for an extended period. Let\u2019s discuss the business factors that are likely to translate into sustained growth and cash flow upside for these businesses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLeonardo DRS (DRS) 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLeonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) stock has moved higher by 50% in the last 12 months without much attention. The growth stock remains attractively valued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26. With continued focus on the defense sector on the back of escalating geopolitical tensions, DRS stock is a potential multibagger.\n\nAs an overview, Leonardo DRS is a provider of defense electronic products and systems. As a critical defense technology supplier, Leonardo is well positioned to benefit. The company ended 2023 with an order backlog of $7.8 billion. On a year-on-year basis, the backlog increased by 82%. Considering the order intake, Leonardo is well positioned for accelerated growth in the coming years.\n\nA key factor that\u2019s likely to support backlog growth is innovation driven products. Leonardo was recently awarded for a \u201ccooled infrared sensor that unlocks the ability for advanced military and scientific capabilities across multiple domains.\u201d\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) stock has skyrocketed by 165% in the last 12 months. I would look at intermediate corrections for exposure to this under-the-radar growth stock. As an overview, MakeMyTrip is an online travel company with focus on the Indian markets. Further, the company has leadership position among Indian online travel company peers.\n\nEstimates suggest that Indians could be the fourth-largest travel spenders globally by 2030. Total travel expenditure by the end of the decade is projected at $410 billion. Clearly, there is a big addressable market and the long-term uptrend for MMTY stock has just commenced.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a financial perspective, the company has made positive progress since the pandemic. From an operating loss of $18 million in financial year 2021, MakeMyTrip has reported operating profit of $91.8 million for the first nine months of FY24. With operating leverage, it\u2019s likely that margin expansion will sustain.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that MakeMyTrip has grown through acquisitions. With a cash buffer of $608 million, the company has flexibility to pursue potential acquisitions to accelerate growth.\n\nMiniso Group (MNSO) red Miniso (MNSO) sign glowing at night\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Hendrick Wu\n\nSentiments have been bearish for Chinese stocks. That\u2019s possibly a key reason for investors overlooking Miniso Group (NYSE:MNSO) stock. The lifestyle retailer is however undervalued and with positive business metrics, MNSO stock upside is a matter of time. To put things into perspective, MNSO stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.6. The stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 1.99%.\n\nFor the December quarter, Miniso reported revenue growth of 54% on a year-on-year basis to $541 million. Besides stellar growth, Miniso also reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.9%, which was higher by 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis.\n\nThere were two factors that support growth. First, a dynamic product portfolio with a favourable product sales mix. Further, aggressive retail expansion globally. The company ended Q2 2024 with total stores of 6,413. On a year-on-year basis, the number of stores increased by 973.\n\nIn terms of guidance, Miniso expects to open 1,000 (mid-range) stores annually between 2024 and 2028. During the same period, the company expects revenue growth at a CAGR of over 20%. With robust estimates, MNSO stock is a steal at current levels.\n\nAker BP ASA (AKRBF) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocks\n\nSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith oil prices being depressed due to macroeconomic headwinds, Aker BP (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) stock has remained sideways. I believe that it\u2019s a good accumulation opportunity and this under-the-radar oil & gas exploration company can be a massive value creator. Besides trading at a valuation gap, AKRBG stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 8.32%.\n\nAs an overview, Aker BP is an oil & gas exploration with focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. As of 2023, the company reported 2P reserves of 1.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Through the years, Aker has grown through merger and acquisitions. For 2023, the company reported production of 457mboepd. With steady growth, Aker expects production of 525mboepd by 2028.\n\nA big positive for Aker BP is low break-even assets. The entire portfolio break-even is estimated at $35 to $40 per barrel. This provides robust free cash flow visibility even if oil trades around $80 per barrel. Last year, Aker reported operating and free cash flow of $5.4 billion and $1.9 billion. With healthy cash flows and low leverage, there is ample flexibility for aggressive exploration activity and potential acquisitions.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is under-the-radar mainly due to the fact that the stock got listed in September 2023. For year-to-date, ARM stock is higher by 62% and corrections would be a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nAs an overview, Arm Holdings develops and licences central processing unit products and related technologies. Recently, Evercore ISI opined that Arm Holdings has a key position across \u201c3 tectonic shifts\u201d\u2019 in computing. These include \u201cAI workloads in smartphones, in the data-center as CPUs move on from x86 infrastructure to Arm and in Internet of things devices.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Arm has moved from general purpose CPUs to AI enabled CPUs for specific applications. This includes IoT, automobile, cloud, mobile and consumer electronic. For Q3 2024, Arm reported revenue growth of 14% on a year-on-year basis to $824 million. With free cash flow of $251 million for the quarter, Arm is positioned for annualized FCF of $1 billion. Also, as royalty revenue increases in the coming years, FCF will continue to swell.\n\nAlbemarle (ALB) Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWith the deep correction in lithium, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock has plunged. The stock has subsequently been ignored by investors. However, for long term investors, I see this as a golden opportunity to accumulate.\n\nSome analysts are expecting lithium shortage to come as early as 2025. Further, Boston Consulting Group estimates that the lithium supply gap will touch 1.1 million metric tons by 2035. It\u2019s therefore likely that lithium will trend higher in the coming years. Albemarle, with strong fundamentals, is well positioned to grow.\n\nFor now, Albemarle is focused on scaling back investments and cutting cost. The company expects to unlock $750 million in cash flow through reduced capital expenditures, costs and working capital.\n\nHowever, the company continues to guide for lithium sales volume growth at a CAGR of 20% through 2027. With a liquidity buffer of $1.8 billion and an investment grade credit rating, Albemarle is positioned for aggressive investments on lithium price recovery.\n\nIAMGOLD (IAG) A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmong penny stocks with multibagger potential, IAMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) looks attractive. Gold trades near $2,380 an ounce and with possibility of rate cuts in 2024, I expect further upside for the precious metal. Geopolitical tensions also support the bull thesis for gold.\n\nIAMGOLD is therefore positioned to benefit as realized gold price inches higher. This will translate into EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow upside. However, that\u2019s not the only reason to be bullish on IAMGOLD.\n\nThe company has quality gold assets that provide visibility for sustained upside in production. Some of the key assets include C\u00f4t\u00e9, Gosselin, Nelligan and Chibougamau district.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that C\u00f4t\u00e9 has commenced production in March. The asset life extends through 2041 with current year production estimated at 220,000 to 290,000 ounces. This provides robust growth visibility.\n\nIAMGOLD ended 2023 with a liquidity buffer of $754.1 million. The existing liquidity coupled with healthy cash flow visibility will ensure that the company continues to invest aggressively.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Must-Buy Growth Stocks That are Blue-Chips in the Making",
        "content": "Blue-chip growth stocks are not made overnight. These stocks represent companies that have built their business over years or decades. This comes through a good management team focusing on innovation and industry tailwinds, among other factors. From an investment perspective, the biggest wealth creators are potential blue-chip growth stocks that are grabbed early.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not easy and takes a lot of research, conviction and patience. The journey from a growth stock to a blue-chip involves depression and deep corrections. The conviction to hold the business pays off handsomely in the long term.\n\nThe focus of this column is on potential blue-chip growth stocks to buy. The stocks discussed represent businesses that can make it big in the next five to ten years. Considering an investment horizon until 2030, these ideas can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the company and industry factors of these blue-chip growth stocks likely to be catalysts for businesses to grow multi-fold in revenue and cash flows.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto logo and store in downtown Lujiazui. Li Auto Also known as Li Xiang, is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. Business and finance concept photo.\n\nSource: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is a likely massive value creator among Chinese EV companies. Considering the growth trajectory, LI stock looks deeply undervalued at a forward price-earnings ratio of 16.2.\n\nRecently, the stock corrected sharply as the management revised the outlook for Q1 2024 on the downside. What I liked about the company\u2019s press release was the management acknowledging the mistakes. First, the \u201coperating strategy of Li MEGA was mis-paced.\u201d Further, the company \u201d excessively emphasized sales volume and competition.\u201d With a focus back on creating value for users and operating efficiency, Li Auto is well-positioned for sustained growth.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Li ended 2023 with a cash buffer of $14.6 billion. Further, the company might be positioned for annual free cash flow of $8 to $10 billion.\n\nHowever, Li has remained conservative in spreading its wings too early. The company has continued to focus on China when peers like Nio (NYSE:NIO) and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) are looking at aggressive international expansion. A focused growth strategy will continue to deliver results and help keep margins attractive.\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe iGaming and online sports betting sector will likely get bigger in the United States in the coming years. DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a turnaround story and will likely be a massive value creator by 2030.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the iGaming and OSB market is expected to grow from $20 billion in 2023 to $30 billion by 2028. This is just for the existing states where DraftKings operates. With legalization likely in more states, the addressable market will get bigger.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecific to DraftKings, cash burn was a key challenge. However, that has been addressed, and the company is positioned to sustain EBITDA margin expansion. For the current year, the company has guided for revenue and EBITDA of $4.8 billion and $460 million, respectively.\n\nFurther, the company expects to achieve adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion in 2026 and $2.1 billion by 2028. Again, these estimates are for existing states. With expansion into new states, the EBITDA visibility will be higher. The business is, therefore on-track to be a cash flow machine in the coming years and DKNG stock is likely to deliver multibagger returns.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIf we consider a time horizon of ten years, India is likely to be among the fastest growing economies in the world. Be it favorable demographics, a swelling middle-class or China plus one policy, India has the ingredients to create wealth. MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is therefore among the list of blue-chip growth stocks to consider.\n\nAs an overview, MakeMyTrip is the largest online travel and tourism company in India. MMYT stock has surged by 190% in the last 12 months with the industry gaining traction after the pandemic. However, considering the impending growth potential, the stock is worth accumulating on corrections.\n\nTo put things into perspective, India had 158 million middle-class households in 2018. This is likely to swell to 300 million by 2030. Further, by the end of the decade, India will have the second largest internet user base. Clearly, there is ample headroom for growth in the travel market.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that in the financial year 2021, the company reported an adjusted operating loss of $18 million. For the first nine months of the current FY, MakeMyTrip has reported operating profit of $91.8 million. With a strong balance sheet and sustained growth in profitability, the outlook is positive for MMYT stock.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) The Coupang (CPNG stock) campus in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce stocks were hot during the pandemic. However, in a post-pandemic world, there were growth adjustments on the downside. This translated into a downside for some of the best e-commerce stocks. However, with the industry expected to grow at a steady pace, it\u2019s a good time to look at quality growth stocks. Coupang (NYSE:CPNG) stock looks attractive at current levels of $19 and is a potential multibagger.\n\nThe first point to note is that Coupang has a big addressable market within Korea. As of 2023, the Korean e-commerce market was valued at $483 billion. The market size is expected to swell to $563 billion by 2027. With steady growth in active users coupled with an upside in average revenue per user, Coupang is well positioned to benefit.\n\nFurther, Coupang has been making inroads into other Asian markets (including Southeast Asia). This is likely to ensure that the revenue momentum is sustained. It\u2019s also worth noting that Coupang recently completed the acquisition of Farfetch Holdings. The latter is a global marketplace for the luxury fashion industry. The acquisition gives Coupang entry into the European markets. With healthy cash flows and aggressive investments, Coupang is positioned to create value.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) Person holding mobile phone with logo of British semiconductor company Arm Ltd. on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) stock was listed in September 2023 and has been in an uptrend. I believe that corrections can be used as an opportunity to accumulate the stock. As an overview, Arm Holdings manufactures and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies.\n\nFor Q3 2024, Arm reported healthy revenue growth of 14% on a year-on-year basis to $824 million. For the same period, the company reported free cash flow of $251 million. With an annualized FCF potential of $1 billion, Arm is positioned to invest in innovation. I must add here that as royalty revenue swells, free cash flow will be significantly higher in the next five years.\n\nAn important point to note is that in 2016, Arm Holdings focused on general purpose CPUs. Currently, the company has AI enabled solutions for mobile, IoT, consumer electronic, automobile, cloud and networking. Therefore, the addressable market is big and as the demand for CPUs swells, Arm will continue to benefit.\n\nAker BP ASA (AKRBF) tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocks\n\nSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.com\n\nAker BP ASA (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) is an under-the-radar growth stock with multibagger returns potential. With volatility in oil prices, AKRBF stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months and trades at an attractive valuation. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 8.59% and I expect healthy dividend growth in the coming years.\n\nAs an overview, Aker BP is an oil and gas company with an asset focus in the Norwegian Continental Shelf. As of 2023, the company reported 2P reserves of 1.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The company has grown in the last ten years through multiple mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that the company\u2019s assets have an attractive break-even. The entire portfolio break-even is at $35 to $40 per barrel. Even if oil trades at $80 to $90 per barrel, there is robust EBITDA and cash flow visibility.\n\nLast year, Aker reported operating cash flow (after taxes) of $5.3 billion. With production growth and potentially higher realized oil prices, OCF is likely to be higher in 2024. This sets stage for dividend growth and aggressive exploration investments.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) a lithium battery\n\nSource: Pixel Enforcer/ShutterStock.com\n\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) is among the emerging companies that are likely to make it big in the coming years. Currently, the company commands a market valuation of just $1 billion. I would not be surprised if the valuations swell by 20x or 30x by 2030.\n\nThe first catalyst is a potential reversal in lithium and a steady uptrend. That seems entirely likely in the coming years with an impending supply gap. Further, Lithium Americas has ownership of the prized Thacker Pass project.\n\nThe asset has an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion and a mine life of 40 years. Production is expected to commence in 2027 with the first phase (years one to four) likely to deliver an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion. The second phase\u2019s annual EBITDA is likely at $2 billion (years five to 40).\n\nClearly, the asset is poised to be a cash flow machine. Once commercialized, it\u2019s likely that Lithium Americas will scout for more asset acquisitions. This will set the stage for the next phase of growth.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital",
        "content": "Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) so let's look a bit deeper.\n\nWhat Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on MakeMyTrip is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.058 = US$56m \u00f7 (US$1.5b - US$547m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThus, MakeMyTrip has an ROCE of 5.8%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Hospitality industry average of 9.6%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MakeMyTrip  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured MakeMyTrip's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for MakeMyTrip .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nLike most people, we're pleased that MakeMyTrip is now generating some pretax earnings. Historically the company was generating losses but as we can see from the latest figures referenced above, they're now earning 5.8% on their capital employed. In regards to capital employed, MakeMyTrip is using 30% less capital than it was five years ago, which on the surface, can indicate that the business has become more efficient at generating these returns. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. The current liabilities has increased to 36% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business.\n\nThe Key Takeaway\n\nIn summary, it's great to see that MakeMyTrip has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nOn a separate note, we've found  1 warning sign for MakeMyTrip  you'll probably want to know about.\n\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this freelist of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that tech stocks are on fire. The major American stock indexes have reached new highs in 2024, with growth and technology companies leading the way. There are good reasons for much of these gains, such as the booms that we\u2019re seeing in artificial intelligence and semiconductors right now.\n\nHowever, not all tech stocks are created equal, and several are being overvalued. Many firms that are rallying today simply do not have the sort of fundamentals to back up these powerful moves that we\u2019ve seen over the past 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s now time to be taking profits on these overvalued tech stocks. These three in particular look vulnerable to serious drawdowns in the months to come.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an Indian online travel agency. Investors have long viewed it as something akin to the Expedia of the Indian market.\n\nShares have been publicly traded for more than a decade. Traditionally, they\u2019ve had a rocky go of it with the stock essentially trading flat between 2012 and 2022. However, as the travel reopening theme took off, MMYT stock has surged over the past year.\n\nShares have skyrocketed from a low of $25 last year to more than $75 per share today. All told, the stock is up 217% over the past 12 months and, incredibly enough, is already up 62% year-to-date.\n\nThere\u2019s a real story to the underlying company. MakeMyTrip is growing its earnings quickly thanks to the strong global economy and heightened travel spending. However, the travel boom is unlikely to persist forever.\n\nMeanwhile, MMYT stock is going for more than 100 times trailing earnings and 11 times price-to-sales. The valuation looks exceedingly expensive for an online travel agency.\n\nAppLovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nAppLovin (NASDAQ:APP) is a software company which develops and operates a mobile marketing platform and ecosystem. It offers products such as AppDiscovery, MAX, and SparkLabs.\n\nAppLovin, as the name might suggest, primarily helps mobile application developers to monetize their programs, and further boost their marketing and consumer engagement efforts.\n\nAPP stock has gone on an absolute tear over the past year with the shares rising more than 350%. This seems completely unjustified. The company grew revenues just 17% over the past year, which is certainly a respectable rate but not typically associated with such a dramatic stock price increase.\n\nInvestors are pleased that AppLovin has been able to work around some of the privacy restrictions that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other operators have put in their ecosystems. AppLovin is certainly making progress as a business and its AI ad system is also sparking investor enthusiasm. But at 75 times trailing earnings, this seems grossly overvalued for a company with a fairly pedestrian revenue growth rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\n25 years ago, Dell (NYSE:DELL) was a popular investment as it was at the forefront of major trends in consumer electronics hardware.\n\nBut times change. The Dell of today has become a somewhat stodgy IT vendor that has traditionally earned a low valuation from Wall Street. The company has barely grown top-line revenues in recent years, making it a cash cow but one with seemingly limited upside.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, a dash of artificial intelligence will cause a stock to skyrocket. DELL stock is now up 225% over the past 12 months pushing the normally staid hardware company up to a surprising 30 times P/E multiple.\n\nMake no mistake, Dell is selling some AI enabled servers and hardware. To some extent, Dell will benefit from current trends. However, the move seems grossly overdone. Morningstar analyst William Kerwin sees more than 50% downside for DELL stock from current levels as the hype wears off.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "MakeMyTrip Group CEO Skift\n\nIndian online travel agency MakeMyTrip made a push Monday to go global: It has extended its services to over 150 countries, including the UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, and France.\n\nUntil now, it has operated primarily in India, the U.S., and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThis expansion comes after MakeMyTrip\u2019s compliance with key international standards and regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\n\nThe primary motivation behind this move is to ensure that travelers, regardless of their geographical location, can use the platform\u2019s offerings. Travelers can now seamlessly book flights, hotels, and holiday packages for themselves and their families across the globe through MakeMyTrip, the company told Skift.\n\n\u201cBefore this, our existing users could reach us while traveling abroad for their trip for any existing booking,\u201d MakeMyTrip said in a statement to Skift. \u201cHowever, travelers from Europe and the UK faced limitations\u00a0when attempting to make fresh bookings\u00a0on the platform. With the platform now achieving GDPR compliance, these constraints have\u00a0been eliminated.\u201d\n\nVirendra Jain, co-founder and CEO of Videc, a travel research firm, said MakeMyTrip\u2019s global strategy isn\u2019t surprising.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s coming in now because of all the compliances that were required,\u201d Jain said.\n\nIn its India Travel Market Sizing report released last year, Videc noted that MakeMyTrip Group was the largest online travel agency in the country with 54% share of total gross booking value in online travel.\n\nThe Indian Diaspora\n\n\u201cOur global accessibility will help us reach the vast Indian diaspora. Importantly, this expansion will enable us to cater to a broader audience, fostering increased inbound travel to India,\u201d said Rajesh Magow, co-founder and group CEO of MakeMyTrip.\n\nChina\u2019s leading online travel agency, Trip.com, has used a similar strategy.\n\nJain emphasized the significance of diaspora communities in driving travel and tourism markets, citing India, China, and to a lesser extent, the Philippines, as major opportunities.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe noted that MakeMyTrip\u2019s extensive coverage of Indian destinations and its diverse range of accommodations position the company well to meet the inbound demand for India, including travelers seeking spiritual and wellness experiences.\n\nJain noted this latest move by MakeMyTrip aligns with the online travel agency\u2019s track record of successfully replicating its India-focused strategy in other emerging markets, notably in the UAE.\n\n\u201cMakeMyTrip grew exponentially in the UAE banking upon the diaspora, but has now localized its offerings for the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) population. The company is now aiming for a similar success in the Saudi market, anticipating significant growth in both domestic inbound and outbound travel. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it wants to replicate this model to other global emerging markets,\u201d he added.\n\nAs MakeMyTrip expands, it will need to prioritize customer service. \u201cWhile traveling to any international destination, one\u2019s priority is security of reservation and customer service,\u201d one analyst told Skift. \u201cThe trust factor will play an important role for MakeMyTrip in the competitive online travel space.\u201d\n\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.",

        "content": "In this article, we will be covering the 25 most visited places in Asia and Pacific Ocean. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5Most Visited Places In Asia And Pacific Ocean.\n\nRecovering From A Global Pandemic: Tourism Industry\n\nDuring the pandemic, the tourism industry globally suffered gravely. The imposition of international travel restrictions drastically reduced the number of tourist arrivals. However, the industry is gradually recovering and is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024. According to a report by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the total international tourism receipts in 2023 reached $1.4 trillion which indicates a 93% recovery compared to the pre-pandemic levels. In 2019, the international tourist receipts amounted to $1.5 trillion. A similar trend is evident in total export revenues from tourism. In 2019, the total export revenues from tourism had a value of $1.7 trillion and have made a 95% comeback to reach $1.6 trillion in 2023. The optimistic tourism rates indicate that the global and Asian tourism market is poised to reach pre-pandemic levels soon.\n\nAs the tourism rates are recuperating, the economic contribution of tourism is also increasing. In 2023, the tourism direct gross domestic product (TDGDP) amounted to $3.3 trillion, or 3% of global GDP. The substantial contribution to the global GDP indicates a significant recovery driven by strong domestic and international tourism. The rebounding of Asian markets and tourist destinations is expected to fuel the growth of the global tourism industry in 2024.\n\nAs destinations reopened for tourists, the Asia and the Pacific tourist market returned to 65% of the pre-pandemic levels in 2023. The performance of the tourism sector has not been uniform across the region. South Asia was able to regain 87% of the 2019 tourism levels, whereas, North-East Asia only recovered around 55%.\n\nChina is expected to play a significant role in the recovery of the region's tourism market. The outbound and inbound tourism in China is estimated to accelerate in 2024. The visa facilitation by the country along with the enhanced air capacity will drive the growth of tourism rates. Furthermore, China is applying visa-free travel for citizens of several countries including France, Germany, Spain, and Malaysia. The visa-free travel for citizens will last for almost a year.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable Travel Services Companies in Asia\n\nTrip.com Group Ltd (HKG:9961), Yatra Online Inc (NASDAQ:YTRA), and MakeMyTrip Ltd (NASDAQ:MMYT) are some of the most noteworthy companies in Asia providing travel services.\n\nTrip.com Group Ltd (HKG:9961) is a leading travel services provider in Asia and the world.

        "content": "When you buy shares in a company, there is always a risk that the price drops to zero. But if you pick the right business to buy shares in, you can make more than you can lose. For example, the MakeMyTrip Limited (NASDAQ:MMYT) share price has soared 157% return in just a single year. On top of that, the share price is up 36% in about a quarter. Looking back further, the stock price is 65% higher than it was three years ago.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nSee our latest analysis for MakeMyTrip\n\nGiven that MakeMyTrip only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. As a general rule, we think this kind of company is more comparable to loss-making stocks, since the actual profit is so low. For shareholders to have confidence a company will grow profits significantly, it must grow revenue.\n\nOver the last twelve months, MakeMyTrip's revenue grew by 37%. We respect that sort of growth, no doubt. While that revenue growth is pretty good the share price performance outshone it, with a lift of 157% as mentioned above. If the profitability is on the horizon then now could be a very exciting time to be a shareholder. Of course, we are always cautious about succumbing to 'fear of missing out' when a stock has shot up strongly.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nWe know that MakeMyTrip has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at MakeMyTrip's financial health with this freereport on its balance sheet.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that MakeMyTrip shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 157% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 18% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the  1 warning sign  we've spotted with MakeMyTrip .\n\nStory continues\n\nWe will like MakeMyTrip better if we see some big insider buys.

        "title": "7 Millionaire-Maker Penny Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "In general, investors look at penny stocks for trading and speculation. Quick gains are an opportunity for exit and entry into another potentially speculative name. However, not all penny stocks are purely speculative or solely for short term trades. I see some millionaire-maker penny stocks that are worth buying and holding for the long term.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these millionaire-maker penny stocks represent companies that are at an early growth stage. These companies have ambitious plans and if the execution is good, sky is the limit for the stock.\n\nOf course, these stocks have high-risk and portfolio exposure must be restricted. However, even a limited exposure of 15% can change the shape of the portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis column discusses seven millionaire-maker penny stocks that represents companies with good fundamentals. While it\u2019s important to carefully monitor business developments, these stocks are worth holding for the next five years for millionaire-maker potential.\n\nBitfarms (BITF) Bitcoin and crypto mining farm. Big data center. High tech server computers at work. Bitfarms (BITF) mines crypto.\n\nSource: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surging past $50,000, it\u2019s difficult to ignore crypto stocks.\n\nFurther, with Bitcoin halving due, it\u2019s likely that the momentum for the cryptocurrency will sustain. The long-term outlook is equally promising with Cathie Wood expecting Bitcoin to touch $1.5 million by 2030.\n\nI am therefore bullish on multi-bagger returns for some of the best Bitcoin mining stocks.\n\nBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is an attractive bet among potential millionaire-maker penny stocks. Besides the tailwinds in the form of Bitcoin surging higher, the company has a strong balance sheet and aggressive growth plans.\n\nAs of January, Bitfarms reported hash rate capacity of 6.5EH/s. By the end of the year, the company is targeting capacity of 21EH/s.\n\nThis will translate into stellar revenue and cash flow upside. I must add here that Bitfarms has a debt-free balance sheet with a liquidity buffer of $118 million as of December 2023. Therefore, there is ample financial flexibility for investment in expansion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) Tilray (TLRY) logo on a web browser.\n\nSource: Jarretera / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) is another name among millionaire-maker penny stocks.\n\nAfter an extended period of downturn for cannabis stocks, I am bullish on the sector for the coming years. Assuming that cannabis is legalized at the federal level, TLRY stock can be an easy 10-bagger in the next 24 months.\n\nI must add that even without legalization, the U.S. cannabis market is likely to be worth $71 billion by 2030. Further, the European medicinal cannabis market is likely to be big in the coming years. Therefore, there is ample headroom for growth and value creation.\n\nTilray Brands was focused on diversification in 2023. The company is now the fifth largest craft beer brewer in the U.S. because of acquisitions.\n\nThe acquisitions have improved the company\u2019s strategic infrastructure in the country, in addition to diversifying its operations. This will enable aggressive expansion if cannabis is legalized at the federal level.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Tilray reported record net revenue and a year-on-year growth of 34%. Further, the company has also guided for positive adjusted free cash flow in the current financial year. With all these positives, TLRY stock is likely to go ballistic.\n\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nLithium stocks have been depressed and looks undervalued after a big correction. It\u2019s likely that lithium price recovery will be gradual. However, the long-term outlook is positive with a significant impending supply-gap.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore a good time to invest in some of the best lithium stocks with millionaire-maker potential. Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) looks attractive at a current market valuation of $743 million. I would bet on 10x to 20x returns for this stock in the next five years.\n\nFor Lithium Americas, the Thacker Pass project is a value creator. The asset has a mine life of 40-years with the company expecting an average annual EBITDA of $1.1 billion. With an after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion, the deep valuation gap is clear.\n\nThe Thacker Pass project funding seems secure with General Motors (NYSE:GM) committing to invest $650 million in two tranches. GM also has an offtake agreement for 10 years from phase one of production.\n\nBlink Charging (BLNK) a blink charging station, BLNK stock\n\nSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.com\n\nBlink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is among the few emerging names in the EV charging industry that\u2019s likely to create massive value. An important point to note is that investments in charging infrastructure needs to accelerate to achieve the target of 30\u201342 million EVs on U.S. roads. Therefore, there is ample scope for growth through the decade.\n\nSpecific to Blink Charging, the revenue growth trajectory has been stellar. For Q3 2023, the company reported revenue growth of 152% on a year-on-year basis to $43.4 million.\n\nRecently, the company announced preliminary numbers for Q4 2023 and it has exceeded the guidance. Blink expects full-year revenue to surpass $140 million. The company has reaffirmed the guidance for positive Adjusted EBITDA run rate by December 2024.\n\nConsidering the revenue growth trajectory, it\u2019s likely that EBITDA margin expansion will be significant in the next 24 to 36 months. A sustained increase in service revenue will also support margin expansion. Overall, the worst seems to be over for BLNK stock and I expect multi-bagger returns from current levels.\n\nYatra Online (YTRA) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nYatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA) is an online travel company with a focus on the Indian markets. The company is a provider of air ticketing, hotel packages, and related services.\n\nWith a big addressable market in an emerging economy, I am bullish on YTRA stock creating immense value.\n\nThe company has differentiated itself from competition to emerge as the largest corporate travel player in India. Yatra has a customer base of 800 corporates with an addressable employee base of more than seven million.\n\nYatra is also scaling-up its business-to-consumer segment. In terms of consumer brand awareness, Yatra is only behind MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) in India. With the economy growing at a healthy pace and with a swelling middle-class, there is ample scope for growth.\n\nFor Q3 2024, Yatra reported 23% year-on-year growth in revenue to $13.4 million. For the same period, the company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA. With a robust growth outlook, I expect meaningful EBITDA margin expansion in the coming quarters.\n\nBlade Air Mobility (BLDE) The Blade Air Mobility (BLDE) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlade Air Mobility (NASDAQ:BLDE) stock is among the under-the-radar penny stocks that seems poised for multibagger returns.\n\nThe company is a provider of air transport alternatives to congested ground routes in the United States. These services are provided through charter flights, helicopters, and seaplanes. However, Blade Air has an asset-light business model.\n\nThe company is on a high-growth trajectory. For Q3 2023, Blade Air reported 56% growth in revenue on a year-on-year basis to $71.4 million. It was also the first quarter where the company reported positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows.\n\nBesides providing air transport to customers, Blade Air is also involved in the transportation of human organs for transplant in the United States. The company recently launched its new organ matching service.\n\nWith cost efficiencies coupled with a focus on the organ transportation segment, the company expects \u201csignificant year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.\u201d As margin expands in the coming quarters coupled with strong revenue growth, I expect BLDE stock to surge higher.\n\nIAMGOLD (IAG) An image of multiple gold bars. Gold prices\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI am bullish on gold considering the factors of geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the likelihood of expansionary monetary policies. Among penny gold mining stocks, IAMGOLD (NYSE:IAG) stock looks attractive and is poised for multi-bagger returns.\n\nAn important catalyst for IAMGOLD in 2024 and beyond is the commencement of production from the Cote gold mine. For 2023, the company reported attributable gold production from continuing operations of 465,000 ounces.\n\nExcluding Cote, IAMGOLD has guided for attributable gold production (mid-range) of 460,000 ounces this year. However, if Cote production is included, the attributable production for the year is likely to increase to 715,000 ounces.\n\nClearly, IAMGOLD is positioned for stellar production growth. If this is associated with higher realized gold price, I expect a strong jump in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flows. I must add that IAMGOLD has a strong liquidity buffer of $755 million as of December 2023.\n\nWith visibility for healthy cash flows, financial flexibility remains high for aggressive exploration activity and potential acquisitions.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "4 Stocks to Watch in a Promising Internet Delivery Services Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry participants like GoDaddy GDDY, MakeMyTrip MMYT, QuinStreet QNST and Asure Software ASUR have been benefiting from the reopening of economies, with their business activities reaching pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, a greater Internet presence in emerging markets, a burgeoning affluent middle class and the accelerated uptake of smartphones are set to aid Internet \u2013 Delivery Services industry participants. Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth. However, as expansion into newer markets will take some time to generate volumes, higher upfront costs might erode profitability. These, along with elevated operating expenses related to hiring new employees and sales and marketing strategies to capture more market share, are likely to strain margins in the near term.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry primarily comprises companies that offer services via Internet-based platforms. These include food delivery, online travel booking, direct marketing and media services and web hosting, among others. Some companies in this space offer Internet domain registration and web hosting registration and sell e-business-related software and services. A few industry participants provide air and train ticket bookings, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, bus tickets and car hire services. Some players offer online direct marketing and media services, including online messaging, email broadcasting, search engine marketing and brand management facilities. Growth-stage companies in the industry are spending more on R&D and sales & marketing, making it difficult for them to generate profits in the near term.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Internet - Delivery Services Industry\n\nSmartphones & Internet Penetration Act as Key Catalysts: The Internet is ubiquitous, and the heightening usage of smartphones is changing the delivery landscape. The companies in the Zacks Internet - Delivery Services industry are benefiting from the growing number of Internet users, coupled with an improvement in Internet penetration and the rapid adoption of the 4G Volte technology. The emergence of 5G technology, which promises faster speed and deliverability, also bodes well for this industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nShifting Consumer Preferences: The shift in consumer preferences, driven by convenience and easy accessibility, is anticipated to aid the industry. The accelerated transition from offline to online food ordering, as well as the rising penetration of online travel booking, augurs well for industry players. However, as the higher consumer spending appetite is the main driver of the overall industry\u2019s health, any sluggishness in the global economy will pose a risk.\n\nHigher Upfront Costs to Hurt Profitability: Online delivery is yet to expand beyond major metros, underlining lower penetration and significant room for growth. However, higher upfront costs related to expansion strategies might erode profitability. Moreover, Amazon\u2019s focus on strengthening its delivery system is a key challenge for the industry players. We believe the company\u2019s powerful distribution channels are a major force that might highly threaten incumbents in this industry. Also, the search giant, Alphabet, has forayed into the food delivery market with its delivery arm, Wing, and an array of food delivery apps, which are likely to intensify competition.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Internet - Delivery Services industry is housed within the broader Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #106, which places it among the top 42% of about 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group\u2019s earnings growth potential. The industry\u2019s earnings estimate for 2024 has moved up 25.5% over the past 12 months.\n\nEstimate Revision for 2024\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Outperforms the S&P 500 but Lags Sector\n\nThe Zacks Internet - Delivery industry has outperformed the S&P 500 composite but has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector over the past year.\n\nThe industry has risen 37.5% during this period, while the S&P 500 and the broader sector have increased 23% and 45.9%, respectively.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Internet-Delivery stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.07X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 4.05X and the sector\u2019s 4.67X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.34X and as low as 0.57X and recorded a median of 0.89X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Sales Ratio (Industry vs. S&P 500)\n\nPrice-to-Sales Ratio (Industry vs. Sector)\n\n4 Stocks in Focus\n\nGoDaddy: It is an Internet domain registrar and web hosting company that also sells e-business-related software and services. The company is engaged in designing and developing cloud-based technology products for small businesses, web design professionals and individuals. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nGoDaddy is benefiting from strong momentum across the Applications & Commerce business and its expanding global footprint. Strength in Create & Grow solutions is aiding the Application & Commerce segment\u2019s top-line growth. Website plus marketing, driven by greater engagement with customers based on new product launches, is contributing well. Strong renewals & registrations and the expansion of the GoDaddy Registry are major catalysts. Growth in bookings, primarily driven by strong customer additions and price increases in various domains, has been a key catalyst.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 25 to $4.64 per share over the past seven days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: GDDY\n\nMakeMyTrip: It is an online travel service company that offers travel products and solutions in India and the United States. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's services and products include air tickets, customized holiday packages, hotel booking, railway tickets, bus tickets and car hire. It also facilitates access to travel insurance.\n\nMakeMyTrip is gaining substantially from improving travel conditions and the reopening of economies. In addition, recovering hotel demand as a result of the rise in short-stay getaway vacations, great travel deals and hygienically safe properties is a major upside. Also, the company is optimistic about its cost-control initiatives, MySafety and GoSafe programs, and strengthening hotel business.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised upward to $1.17 per share from $1.13 30 days ago.\n\nPrice and Consensus: MMYT\n\nQuinStreet: It is a provider of online direct marketing and media services. QuinStreet offers online messaging, e-mail broadcasting, search engine marketing and brand management services.\n\nQuinStreet is benefiting from the accelerated shift from an offline to an online business model across industries. Ad spending is likely to continue increasing, driven by an improving macroeconomic environment and business activities. The company is well-positioned to bank on this opportunity and acquire new customers and high-value deals.\n\nQuinStreet carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised downward to 16 cents from 32 cents in the past 30 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: QNST\n\nAsure Software: This is a cloud computing firm that offers business clients the chance to modernize everything from human capital management (HCM) and time & attendance solutions to payroll and taxes. Asure Software\u2019s strategic initiative to become a pure software-as-a-service HCM company is aiding its top-line growth.\u00a0 This Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s focus on driving innovation for its HCM solutions is helping it expand its footprint in the HCM market.\n\nNew client additions and a continued focus on cross-selling to existing clients are driving Asure Software\u2019s revenues. The company\u2019s differentiated employee strategy, measurement capabilities and comprehensive product offerings are helping it win new customers.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asure Software\u2019s 2024 earnings has remained unchanged at 66 cents per share in the past 60 days.\n\nPrice and Consensus: ASUR\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019sIBD 50 is \u201ca weekly, rules-based, computer-generated stock index.\u201d It \u201cseeks to identify the current top 50 growth stocks.\u201d Since the companies on the IBD Top 50 do tend to have strong fundamentals and excellent growth characteristics, it\u2019s a good screening tool that enables investors to find good stocks to buy. Moreover, not all of the names on the list are well-known firms. It\u2019s possible to find \u201chidden gems\u201d well-positioned to outperform the stock market on the IBD 50. For example, in the last year, I found two huge winners\u2014Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW)\u2014on the list. The following three stocks which are currently on the list are each extremely attractive for specific groups of investors.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an ttractive stock for investors looking for exposure to India, one of Earth\u2019s fastest-growing, best-positioned countries.\n\nIndeed, the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow an impressive 6% more than inflation last year. Economists anticipate it will repeat that feat in 2024. India is benefiting from positive demographic trends and the migration of many factories from China to India.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd MakeMyTrip, in turn, is clearly getting a lift from the rapid growth of the Indian economy. Last quarter, the online travel agency\u2019s revenue jumped 25.6% compared to $170.5 million a year earlier. In contrast, its operating profit, excluding some items, jumped to $33.4 million from $19.7 million during the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u201cDuring this seasonally strong quarter, we witnessed robust demand for leisure travel across all domestic and international destinations leading to the highest-ever quarterly gross bookings, revenue, and profit for the company,\u201d CEO Rajesh Magow reported.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which markets cosmetics, is a great stock to buy for investors looking to benefit from American consumers\u2019 strength and the love millennials and Generation Z have for experiences. Many consumers use cosmetics when they enjoy experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.L.F.\u2019s brand certainly resonates with a large portion of the market. Indeed, last quarter, its revenue soared 85% versus the same period a year earlier to $271 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped 61% year-over-year to $59.1 million.\n\nOn Feb. 5, investment bank Oppenheimeridentified ELF as its favorite name in the Consumer Staples space.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gives ELF a very high Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, indicating that it\u2019s one of the more well-rounded names on the IBD Top 50.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a great pick for investors who want to benefit from the emerging Edge AI trend. As I noted in a previous column, \u201cEdge AI devices are connected to the internet and have their own AI rather than relying on distant data centers and the cloud.\u201d These devices provide users with major advantages over cloud-based AI. Specifically, they run more quickly, are more secure, and enable the use of many more applications.\n\nANET markets \u201chardware for localized data centers\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing.\u201c As a result, it\u2019s well-positioned to benefit from the proliferation of Edge AI.\n\nMoreover, the firm\u2019s top and bottom lines are already expanding rapidly. Last quarter, its revenue advanced 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.5 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items, rose to $6.94 from $4.58 in Q4 of 2022.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SMCI.

        "content": "By their very nature, consumer stocks are the bane of risk-averse investors.\n\nHigh inflationary environments and tight budgets can heavily impact consumer discretionary companies, leading to performance slumps and higher downside risks. S&P\u2019s Global Market Intelligence found that consumer discretionary remained the highest-risk sector at the tail end of 2023, and companies belonging to the sector were some of the most shorted stocks in the market.\n\nHowever, not all consumer discretionary stocks are made equal. Some remain at the top of the pile, growing their earnings and performing well in different market conditions. Indeed, their resiliency makes them attractive candidates for daring investors who want to buy consumer discretionary stocks. Lucky for you, we are fans of stocks like these, too. In this article, we will look at our top list of consumer discretionary stock earnings winners that you can pick from.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAutoliv (ALV) assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAutoliv (NYSE:ALV) is a passive safety systems developer and manufacturer for the automotive industry. Its passive safety systems include frontal-impact and side-impact airbag protection, inflator technologies, battery cut-off switches and seatbelts. ALV also offers mobility safety solutions for two-wheeler drivers, which include pedestrian protection, cut-off switches and other safety solutions. Its subsidiaries include Autoliv ASP and Autoliv AB. Autoliv recently raised capital using green bonds to help finance its climate change targets and align with the broader society\u2019s climate change agenda.\n\nALV reported solid Q423 financials, with record sales surging to 18% YoY growth and reaching $2.75 billion. The growth was primarily driven by a 16% organic sales growth and an improvement in operating margin. Its EPS rose by 51% to $2.71, while adjusted EPS grew by 105% to $3.74.\n\nALV is optimistic about 2024 and expects a 5% organic sales growth and a 10.5% adjusted operating margin by the end of the year. Moreover, the company has a solid market position, continued growth initiatives and progress in its sustainability efforts, making it one of the more attractive consumer discretionary stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nGentex (GNTX) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration.
