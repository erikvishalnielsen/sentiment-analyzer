Here's what investors should know.\n\ne.l.f. beat analysts' revenue expectations by 9.8% last quarter, reporting revenues of $321.1 million, up 71.4% year on year. It was a mixed quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates but underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year.\n\nIs e.l.f. a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\n\nThis quarter, analysts are expecting e.l.f.'s revenue to grow 40.8% year on year to $304.7 million, slowing from the 76.5% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.84 per share. e.l.f. Total Revenue\n\nAnalysts covering the company have generally reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. e.l.f. has a history of exceeding Wall Street's expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 14.9% on average.\n\nLooking at e.l.f.'s peers in the personal care segment, some have already reported their Q2 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. Edgewell Personal Care posted flat year-on-year revenue, meeting analysts' expectations, and Olaplex reported a revenue decline of 4.8%, in line with consensus estimates.\n\nRead our full analysis of Edgewell Personal Care's results here and Olaplex's results here.\n\nThere has been positive sentiment among investors in the personal care segment, with share prices up 3.4% on average over the last month. e.l.f. is down 11.8% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $223.6 (compared to the current share price of $182).\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ELF is likely to register top-line growth when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Aug 8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $302.64 million, which indicates a 39.9% increase from the year-ago period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the bottom line is likely to have declined year over year. The consensus mark for earnings has dropped by 7.8% in the past 30 days to 83 cents per share, which implies a 24.6% decrease from the year-ago quarter\u2019s figure. ELF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 54.6%, on average.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty Price and EPS Surprise\n\ne.l.f. Beauty price-eps-surprise | e.l.f. Beauty Quote\n\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils\n\nOur proven model doesn\u2019t conclusively predict an earnings beat for e.l.f. Beauty this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. \r\n\r\nThough e.l.f. Beauty currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, it has an Earnings ESP of -0.37%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\n\nFactors to Note\n\ne.l.f. Beauty has been benefiting from its focus on expanding its product portfolio and driving innovation across its cosmetics offerings to cater to evolving consumer preferences and trends in the beauty industry. Recognizing the shift toward online shopping, the company has also been investing in enhancing its digital and e-commerce capabilities.\r\n\r\ne.l.f. Beauty has been witnessing net sales growth and market share gains for 21 straight quarters now, reflecting the company\u2019s strong operational execution and market demand. Strength in the color cosmetics category has been working well for e.l.f. Beauty. On its last earnings call, management stated that it remains optimistic about this category, which is likely to have aided sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s skincare category has also been doing well, and management sees significant potential for growth in this category, per the last earnings call. Gains from new product launches and the acquisition of Naturium (a complementary skincare brand) are likely to contribute to the upcoming results.\r\n\r\nELF also views international markets as a significant growth area. Apart from this, e.l.f. Beauty has been actively expanding its retail presence and distribution channels to enhance brand visibility and accessibility. The company has forged partnerships with major retailers like Target TGT, Walmart WMT and Ulta Beauty ULTA, securing shelf space in key markets. By diversifying its distribution channels, e.l.f. Beauty has strengthened its market position and captured a broader customer base across different geographies.\r\n\r\nHowever, high raw material costs, particularly for ingredients used in cosmetics and skincare products, could have led to increased production expenses. Additionally, increased investments in marketing and research & development (R&D) to sustain innovation and market presence might have impacted profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Performance & Valuation\n\nShares of e.l.f. Beauty have rallied 7.4% in the past three months against the industry\u2019s decline of 20.7%. The cosmetics and skincare product company also outpaced the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the S&P 500\u2019s respective gains of 3% and 2.9% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 46.96, exceeding the industry average of 22.72 as well as the S&P 500\u2019s 20.76. We believe that this premium valuation reflects the company's successful track record, innovative product offerings and effective strategies in capturing market share, indicating that e.l.f. Beauty is positioned well for continued success and expansion in the beauty industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\ne.l.f. Beauty's strategic initiatives, consistent market share gains, robust revenue growth and innovative product offerings make it a standout player in the beauty industry. The company's effective digital and e-commerce strategies, strong retail partnerships and international expansion efforts further bolster its growth prospects.\r\n\r\nWhile high raw material costs and increased investments in marketing and R&D could impact short-term profitability, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s strategic focus on cost management and operational efficiencies are likely to mitigate these effects. Given these strengths and an impressive stock price performance, investors should consider e.l.f. Beauty a valuable addition to their portfolios.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Fortune recently reported that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is up 17% worldwide through the first half of 2024. Of this activity, 90% of the largest deals so far year-to-date were U.S. targets.\u00a0Almost half of the top 10 deals in 2024 were stock rather than cash payments. That makes sense given interest rates are higher and stock prices are relatively healthy. So, who are the acquisition targets to buy now?\n\nI\u2019ve recommended three stocks that could be acquisition targets. For my criteria, at least one of the companies, acquirer or acquired, must be in the S&P 500. In addition, the targets must have market capitalizations that are significantly lower than the acquirers. Furthermore, these are speculative acquisitions and are not guaranteed to happen. Rather, this serves as a thought experiment of potential moves that could happen in the market.\n\nCelanese (CE) Cellphone with logo of US chemicals company Celanese Corporation (CE) on screen in front of business website Focus on center-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nCelanese (NYSE:CE) is the 83rd smallest company on the index with a market capitalization of $15.15 billion. CE stock is down over 10% YTD as I write this. Furthermore, Celanese is a global leader in the production of specialty materials and chemical products like acetic acid. It is the world\u2019s largest producer of acetyl products, which are used in all kinds of high-value applications and products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIts Q1 2024 sales were $2.61 billion, down 8.4 percent from $2.85 billion a year earlier. Its operating income for the quarter was $210 million, down\u00a0 16.3% from $251 million a year earlier.\n\n\u201cOur first quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute in a commercial environment that has stabilized but still shows limited signs of meaningful recovery,\u201d CEO Lori Ryerkerk said in its Q1 2024 press release.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock is currently valued at 12.35x its forward 2024 earnings. Its price-to-sales ratio is 1.42x, less than the five-year average of 1.74x.\u00a0With significant headwinds still facing its business, it might be a good time for a larger company such as Dow (NYSE:DOW) or DuPont de Nemours (NYSE:DD) to consider buying it.\n\nPinterest (PINS)\n\nPinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) is not part of the index. It has a market cap of $25.78 billion. PINS stock is up 4% YTD at the time of writing. I believe Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which is part of the index, would make an excellent buyer of Pinterest. Facebook doesn\u2019t have the best reputation in social media, while Pinterest is generally considered the only platform that\u2019s not about distributing misinformation.\n\nAs far as social media platforms go, Pinterest has a more creative niche and interactive design. From a financial standpoint, Meta could easily afford PINS as its free cash flow last quarter was $12.53 billion. In the trailing 12 months ended March 31, it was nearly $50 billion, more than enough to Pinterest on its list of acquisition targets.\n\nBut what could compel Meta to make the purchase? Pinterest\u2019s reported Q2 2024 results on July 30 after the market close could give a reason.\u00a0While its results beat on both the top and bottom lines, its shares fell in after-hours trading due to weak guidance.\n\nIts monthly average users (MAUs) in the second quarter were 522.0 million, 12% higher than Q2 2023, and 1.9 million higher than the analyst estimate. Its revenue increased 21% to $853.7 million, and its adjusted EBITDA was $179.9 million, 68% higher than a year ago.\u00a0Beyond the market reaction, Pinterest\u2019s monetization efforts are gaining traction.\n\nIn one acquisition Meta would gain an improved reputation and a more visually appealing social media platform for its 3.07 billion MAUs worldwide.\n\nE.L.F. Beauty (ELF)\n\nE.L.F. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is not in the index. It has a market cap of $9.40 billion. ELF stock is up 20% YTD as I write this and 44% over the past year. However, it\u2019s down nearly 25% from its 52-week high of $221.83.\n\nThe buyer? Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL), whose market cap is 3.7x ELF, has lost nearly half its value over the past year.\n\nIt needs some good news. Earlier this year, it announced it would lay off between 3-5% of its global labor force, cutting as many as 3,000 positions as part of the company\u2019s restructuring that will result in restructuring charges of $500 million to $700 million. As a result, its operating profits should rise nearly 40% once complete, to more than $1.1 billion.\n\nCEO Fabrizio Freda has been in charge of the company since July 2009. In the top position for 15 years, he probably doesn\u2019t want his legacy to be his cost-cutting. Buying ELF would give it some time to find more high-end products that its customers want while gaining a whole bunch of new ones.\n\nAnd it most likely would make the Lauder family, who control the company, much happier about his time spent as CEO.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\n\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis cosmetics company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -24.6%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $302.64 million, up 39.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for e.l.f. Beauty?\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.37%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that e.l.f. Beauty will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that e.l.f. Beauty would post earnings of $0.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering a surprise of +51.43%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\n\nInter Parfums (IPAR), another stock in the Zacks Cosmetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.07 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -1.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $342.05 million, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Inter Parfums has been revised 1.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -10.28%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\n\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Inter Parfums will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF): The Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth.In this article, we are going to take a look at where e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) stands against the other stocks with 30+% revenue growth.\n\nValuing a stock comes in several shapes and flavors. The most common of these is the price to earnings ratio. Not only is this ratio used to evaluate the premium that investors are paying for a firm right now, but it is also used in tandem with forecast earnings to wager a guess at the future share price. This allows investors to position their portfolio with respect to the market and invest in those stocks that they believe can rise in the future.\n\nHowever, a stock's earnings aren't the only income statement item used in stock valuation. Two other popular approaches are the price to sales or P/S ratio and its peer Enterprise Value to Revenue or EV/Revenue ratio. Both of these look at a firm's top line performance, and the latter is typically used to value those firms that are in high growth sectors that are ripe for acquisitions.\n\nAmong these two ratios, the P/S ratio was popularized by the billionaire Ken Fisher. One of the richest people in the world, Fisher has a net worth of $11.2 billion. He shared his approach to using revenue growth in an article for the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) in 1984. Fisher shared that the P/S ratio could help investors \"ratios measure the popularity of the stock.\" This, according to him, was key since it enabled them to sift out those stocks with low P/S ratios as these carried the highest chances of gaining value in the future in case of positive developments. Fisher added that while the P/E ratio was also a measure of popularity, it was too \"elastic\" and dependent on the various accounting assumptions used to arrive at net income.\n\nA P/S ratio, on the other hand, removed the effects of these \"accounting assumptions,\" shared Fisher. To back his claims, he outlined that the stocks in the lower quartile (25%) of P/S ratios delivered 64.57% and 56.11% in returns for the bottom seven and nine stocks, respectively which far outstripped the 28.67% in returns of the nine lowest P/E stocks.\n\nHowever, this piece is about Ray Dalio and not Ken Fisher. Like Fisher, Dalio is also one of the richest people in the world. As of July 2024, Forbes Magazine estimates his net worth to sit at $15.4 billion. Dalio's hedge fund Bridgewater Associates' had listed $19.7 billion worth of investment positions through its SEC filings for 2024's first quarter. These investments follow his approach of taking a broader look at the global economy and geopolitical environment and seeing which stocks can benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nTalking about returns, the past couple of years have been tough for Dalio's firm. While he is neither Bridgewater's CEO nor CIO right now, his philosophy is responsible for having set up most of Bridgewater's most well known products like its Pure Alpha fund. Bridgewater's Pure Alpha has struggled over the past four years. It has lost 4% during this time period, in an environment where global bonds and the economy have struggled due to high inflation and interest rates.\n\nAt the same time, even though Bridgewater has struggled during recent economic crises, it has managed to hold its ground during several crises of the past. For instance, in 2008, the firm delivered 8.7% in gains at a time when the S&P 500 tumbled by 38.5%. It's times like these that show the true mettle of a hedge fund boss, and during 2018, Bridgewater delivered 14.6% in returns which were in sharp contrast to the hedge fund industry's average 6.7% in losses. As for the Pure Alpha 11 fund, it has delivered 11.4% in returns between 1991 and 2022. Finally, 2024 seems to be a breath of fresh air for Dalio's firm too since during Q1 it posted a strong 16% in returns which were 11 percentage points higher than the hedge fund industry's average 4.59% in returns.\n\nComing back to revenue growth, while Fisher's central point when favoring P/S over P/E is the undue effect of accounting on earnings and by extension on the share price, is it possible that revenue surprises also drive stock prices? If they do, then the merit of using P/S, and particularly lower P/S stocks as an investment, increases and becomes more important. On this front, research from Emory University and the Stern Business School analyzed income statements, balance sheets, and returns data between 1987 and 2003, to check if there's any relation between revenue surprises and stock returns around earnings announcements.\n\nIt revealed that \"earnings surprises that are accompanied by revenue surprises signal more persistent earnings growth than similar levels of earnings surprises not accompanied by matching revenues surprises.\" In numerical terms, the research concluded that revenue surprises provide another valuable signal to investors since when stocks were screened for revenue and earnings surprises, the difference between abnormal returns in this category was 8.41% which was nearly two percentage points higher than the difference for stocks screened only for earnings surprises.\n\nSo, as it appears that revenue is an equally important part of stock valuation, we decided to look at Ray Dalio's top revenue growth stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks with 30%+ revenue growth, we first filtered the 230 largest positions of Bridgewater Associates by investment value to pick out only those stocks with an absolute revenue growth greater than 80% for the past three years. Then, these stocks were further filtered with their 1-year revenue growth, and those with a growth higher than 30% were selected. These stocks are ranked by the value of the firm's stake in them during Q1 2024.\n\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). 5 Beauty Treatments That Are Expensive But Totally Worth It\n\nA close up of the lip and eye products from the company on a model in a fashion and beauty shoot.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 33\n\n1 Yr Revenue Growth: 73%\n\nBridgewater Associates\u2019 Q1 2024 Stake: $17.1 million\n\ne.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) is a California based cosmetics and beauty products company. It is a new age cosmetics company, that is seeking to leverage the growth in US population by offering low cost beauty products to a wider market than traditional, high end companies can offer. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) also uses the power of social media to its advantage, which lends it a foothold in a key marketing medium that big firms often struggle to come to terms with. Another key advantage that e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) enjoys its use of direct to consumer sales. This allows it to rapidly get the products out to its customers and provides it agility in a market that is dominated by fast moving trends and incumbents that often have to deal with retailers. However, recent data suggests that e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) is struggling to maintain its market share and bled customers during the first quarter of the year. Any further downward movement here could affect the share price.\n\nClearBridge Investments mentioned e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) in its Q1 2024 earnings letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\n\"ELF, in the consumer staples sector, is the third-largest mass cosmetics brand in the U.S. We believe the flywheel of ELF\u2019s consumer value proposition, its innovation pipeline, and its unique ability to bring prestige-like products to mass consumers and high consumer engagement will enable the company to continue to outgrow the global market. We see significant opportunity for ELF to transform itself from an emerging U.S. color cosmetics brand to a global beauty stalwart by doubling its share in the U.S. over the next few years and gaining share in international and skincare markets. ELF is profitable, balancing growth and earnings, and has an attractive balance sheet.\"\n\nOverall ELF ranks 8th on our list of the stocks with 30+% revenue growth. You can visit Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growthto see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 0.8%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 7.5% below consensus. Inflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the personal care stocks have fared somewhat better than others, they collectively declined, with share prices falling 1.9% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nNu Skin (NYSE:NUS)\n\nWith person-to-person marketing and sales rather than selling through retail stores, Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) is a personal care and dietary supplements company that engages in direct selling.\n\nNu Skin reported revenues of $417.3 million, down 13.3% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 3.5%.

        "title": "3 Fabulous Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Investors have been on a roller coaster ride for the past four years. One of the longest bull markets in history was brought to a screeching halt by the global pandemic. The S&P 500 lost over one-third of its value in a matter of a few weeks.\n\nYet immediately afterward, the popular benchmark index rocketed higher, more than doubling in value over the next 21 months. It then lost a quarter of its value again before turning north once more and running 50% higher. You\u2019re not alone if you\u2019ve experienced vertigo during this time.\n\nYet one constant has been growth stocks leading the market\u2019s gains each year. Although many have been technology stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that did the heavy lifting, if you ignored other investments, you missed out on many other great opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBelow are three growth stocks that have been outstanding investments that beat the S&P 500 over the past five years. They hold the promise of handily outperforming the market in the years ahead, too.\n\nAmgen (AMGN) the Amgen (AMGN) logo on a building during daylight\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBiotech giant Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) owns a portfolio of billion-dollar drugs including its lead osteoporosis and bone cancer therapy Prolia. The treatment delivered $1 billion in sales in the first quarter alone. Amgen had 10 drugs that delivered at least double-digit volume growth during the period. Overall, U.S. volume grew 29% while international volume grew 17%. Absent last year\u2019s acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, product sales grew 6%.\n\nOne of the biggest drivers of future growth could be maritide (AMG 133), Amgen\u2019s obesity drug candidate. The biotech concluded Phase 2 trials and though it didn\u2019t release many details, it seemed positive enough to warrant moving onto Phase 3 trials.\n\nObesity drugs, of course, have been one of the biggest investment themes behind artificial intelligence. Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) set off a round of investment in the category with its two leading therapies, Ozempic and Wegovy. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) came to market soon after with Mounjaro and Zepbound and numerous other pharmaceuticals and biotechs are piling into the space.\n\nAmgen stock is up 43% over the past year and is 116% higher over the last five years, ahead of the S&P 500\u2019s 101% total return. Trading at 16% of next year\u2019s earnings, look for AMGN to pad its lead in years to come.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) How Investors Should Trade NFLX Stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStreaming leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) goes from strength to strength as much of the rest of the competition weakens. The movie streamer ended the second quarter with 277.7 million global paid subscribers, 16.5% year-over-year growth, and 8.1 million new members since the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nA lot of those new subscribers undoubtedly came as a result of cracking down on password sharing. It does, however, suggest investors should not expect to see the same kind of growth moving forward. Revenue, though, grew 17% to $9.6 billion leading to operating income surging 42% from last year. Margins widened by 490 basis points to 27.2%.\n\nThe strong performance comes as Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) agreed to sell itself to Skydance Media, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) considers splitting its broadcast television networks from its streaming and studio operations, and Disney (NYSE:DIS) hopes to put together back-to-back quarterly profits of Disney+. With Netflix stock up 32% over the past year, there is still plenty of gas left in the tank.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last growth stock to buy and hold forever is e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF). If you owned the stock at any time over the past five years, your portfolio is doing exceptionally well. It has returned nearly 1,000% over that time and in 2023 alone the stock tripled in value.\n\nHelping to drive those gains is ELF\u2019s positioning with teens. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s Taking Stock With Teens semi-annual survey, the beauty products company holds the top position with a 38% market share, 16 percentage points more than the next leading brand.\n\nWhile e.l.f. Beauty stock is up 23% so far this year, it had been up as much as 50% in March. It\u2019s down 18% since then. That could be more of the market rotating out of previous growth names than anything wrong with ELF\u2019s business.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter revenue rocketed 71% higher to $321 million and was up 77% for the full-year. Investors may be concerned because e.l.f. Beauty only predicted 21% full-year growth for fiscal 2025. When a growth stock shows decelerating sales growth, they tend to get nervous even if that growth is still excellent.\n\nELF stock may go through a period of retrenchment but the long-term outlook remains strong and e.l.f. Beauty remains a growth stock to own forever.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in WBD stock.

        "content": "Inter Parfums (IPAR) shares ended the last trading session 8.9% higher at $138.35. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 10.9% gain over the past four weeks.\n\nInter Parfums\u2019 shares rallied on optimistic market sentiment following its record second-quarter 2024 net sales numbers. The company capitalized on the strong momentum in the fragrance market, supported by robust sales from its new licenses, Roberto Cavalli and Lacoste, driving overall sales growth. Quarterly net sales rose 11% to $342 million compared with $309 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The increase in sales highlights the company's strategy of maintaining a more even distribution of product launches and investments in advertising and promotions, rather than heavily focusing on peak selling periods.\n\nThis perfume maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.8%. Revenues are expected to be $336.72 million, up 8.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEarnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor Inter Parfums, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on IPAR going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nInter Parfums is a member of the Zacks Cosmetics industry. One other stock in the same industry, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), finished the last trading session 4.6% higher at $177.43. ELF has returned -17% over the past month.\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty , the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming report has changed -4.1% over the past month to $0.84. This represents a change of -23.6% from what the company reported a year ago. e.l.f. Beauty currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Is Trending Stock e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a Buy Now?",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this cosmetics company have returned -17% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2% change. The Zacks Cosmetics industry, to which e.l.f. Beauty belongs, has lost 12% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -23.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.1%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.40 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.9%. This estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.33 indicates a change of +27.3% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $300.96 million indicates a year-over-year change of +39.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.29 billion and $1.52 billion estimates indicate +25.7% and +18.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenues of $321.14 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +71.4%. EPS of $0.53 for the same period compares with $0.42 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.47 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.81%. The EPS surprise was +51.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about e.l.f. Beauty. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Cathie Wood Stocks That Could Heat up Once Interest Rates Dip",
        "content": "As investors look forward to rate cuts in the second half and going into 2025, perhaps those riskier high-multiple technology companies, such as Cathie Wood stocks, that don\u2019t stand to make huge profits until way into the future (if at all) will have their moment in the sun again.\n\nUndoubtedly, Cathie Wood and the Ark Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) have struggled to keep pace with the Nasdaq 100 in recent years. As rates and inflation fall (Cathie Wood sees deflation ahead), the climate certainly seems a heck of a lot more hospitable to speculative innovators that have been long forgotten in this large-cap-favored era of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nOnly time will tell if lower rates cause the Ark funds to get going again. At this juncture, I think it\u2019s unrealistic to expect 2020 lows in interest rates to return. That\u2019s unless deflation is in the cards for the economy, as Wood believes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are three of my favorite Cathie Wood stocks for investors looking to pick and choose their own disruptive innovators to take advantage of lower rates.\n\nTesla (TSLA) White Tesla in front of the factory. TSLA stock\n\nSource: Iv-olga / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood may not be as bullish on the Magnificent Seven heavyweights as most other big-name money managers out there. However, she does have a huge position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock for the flagship ARKK ETF.\n\nThrough the past two years of excess volatility, Wood has stood by Elon Musk and the top EV firm, at least for the most part. Of course, Wood sold some Tesla stock earlier this year, but the ETF remains very much overweight in the name.\n\nAs interest rates fall, perhaps Tesla won\u2019t be as sensitive to inevitable drops in vehicle deliveries. For the most part, deliveries are the only thing that matters for investors who follow Tesla quarter to quarter.\n\nThat said, the longer-term growth story encompasses growth from AI, robotaxis, humanoid robots (Optimus), and energy storage. These projects do not come cheap, so any drop in borrowing costs should be viewed as a major plus.\n\nAt 63.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), TSLA stock looks fully valued after barely falling from its sharp June-July spike.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) stock is another lagging holding within the ARKK ETF. Shares of the interactive gaming platform firm are down around 7% year to date, all while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 surged by double digits.\n\nWith a growing number of brands advertising on Roblox, perhaps investors looking to play an early-form metaverse should punch their ticket into RBLX stock while it\u2019s still down significantly from its all-time highs. Arguably, firms seeking to better resonate with younger consumers should be looking to explore new frontiers, like in Roblox, to market their products.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, e.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF) doubled down on its collaboration with Roblox to allow users to buy cosmetics via Roblox. Indeed, it seems strange to be buying makeup through a video game. Either way, I think the move will be a hit among young players. Perhaps transacting on Roblox could be a hint of what the future of the metaverse holds for marketers.\n\nUipath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Uipath (NASDAQ:PATH), one of the lesser-known Ark holdings, but one that deserves the attention of growth investors seeking AI-driven growth at a reasonable price. Like many other Cathie Wood stocks, PATH shares have been on an abysmal run in the past few years.\n\nPATH stock is still down over 84% from its peak, just shy of $80 per share, which hit all the way back in May 2021.\n\nGiven how things have been going, it looks like shares of the process automation software developer probably won\u2019t be making new highs anytime this decade. The company recently announced it\u2019s laying off 10% of staff (around 420 positions).\n\nIn any case, the $7.2 billion mid-cap Cathie Woodstock looks incredibly cheap at 5.3 times price-to-sales (P/S). With co-founder Daniel Dines re-appointed as CEO, it will be interesting to see how the firm can return on the right path.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, the responsible editor did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks.

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. ELF, once a standout performer, recently encountered a significant setback, witnessing a decline of 20.1% over just a month, underperforming the industry\u2019s decline of 8.9%. The renowned cosmetics and skin care products company has also trailed the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the S&P 500's respective growth of 1.1% and 2% during the same period. This abrupt reversal in fortunes prompts investors to reconsider whether to hold on to their shares or cut their losses. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\ne.l.f. Beauty closed the trading session at $170.70 on Jul 17, quite below its 52-week high of $221.83, indicating a substantial loss in market value within a relatively short period. Additionally, this Oakland, CA-based company\u2019s stock slipped below its 50-day moving average, which is an important indicator for gauging market trends and momentum. Falling below this average suggests a bearish trend, often prompting caution to investors.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, e.l.f. Beauty still appears quite stretched. The stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 46.17, much higher than the industry average of 23.6. This premium valuation implies high growth expectations, which may not be sustainable in the current market environment. The company's Value Score of F further underscores these concerns. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFactors Stealing Glitter From ELF\n\ne.l.f. Beauty operates in a highly saturated and competitive beauty market, facing stiff competition from established mass and prestige brands. Despite holding a solid market share, the company remains vulnerable to intense competition from established players like The Estee Lauder Companies EL and Coty COTY. While e.l.f. Beauty distinguishes itself by offering products at lower price points, this strategic focus on affordability potentially constrains the company's ability to raise prices and expand margins in a market where premium pricing often drives profitability and brand perception.\r\n\r\nIn its latest earnings release, Tarang Amin, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer stated, \u201cAs we look ahead, we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for e.l.f. Beauty across cosmetics, skincare and international markets.\u201d Industry experts viewed this statement and the accompanying guidance as a conservative approach, suggesting that the company still has a long way to go. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, with ELF being largely consumer-driven, it remains prone to rapidly evolving consumer preferences as well as changes in their spending patterns. Macroeconomic concerns such as underlying inflation and higher interest rates have been pinching consumers\u2019 pockets, which could deter them from spending on items like cosmetics.\r\n\r\nApart from this, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s marketing investments have increased significantly, from 7% of net sales to 25% over five years. While this has driven growth, the high marketing spend may not be sustainable in the long term and may put pressure on margins, if not accompanied by proportional sales growth. These factors seem to have dulled investors\u2019 confidence in e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s prospects.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimates Lose Sheen\n\nThe negative sentiment around e.l.f. Beauty is reflected in analysts\u2019 projections. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter earnings per share has declined from 92 cents to 86 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for the current fiscal has also gone from $3.42 to $3.40 in the same period. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRadiance in the Shadows\n\nWhile the high valuation and recent stock performance raise caution, long-term investors should not overlook e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s underlying fundamentals, including its brand innovation, product development, regional expansion and digital transformation efforts.\r\n\r\nThe company prioritizes expanding its product portfolio and driving innovation across its cosmetics offerings to cater to evolving consumer preferences and trends in the beauty industry.\u00a0 New skincare lines and enhanced makeup formulations have been well-received, fostering positive customer feedback and encouraging repeat purchases. Additionally, to revitalize its brand image and enhance consumer perception, e.l.f. Beauty has embarked on strategic marketing campaigns, including celebrity endorsements, influencer collaborations and social media activations.\r\n\r\nThe company has been actively expanding its retail presence and distribution channels to enhance brand visibility and accessibility. ELF has forged partnerships with major retailers like Target TGT and Ulta Beauty, securing shelf space in key markets. By diversifying its distribution channels, e.l.f. Beauty aims to strengthen its market position and capture a broader customer base across different geographies.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the shift toward online shopping, e.l.f. Beauty has been investing in enhancing its digital and e-commerce capabilities. ELF has focused on improving user experience on its website, optimizing mobile platforms and leveraging digital marketing strategies to increase online sales and customer engagement. These efforts are crucial in expanding its reach and driving growth in the highly competitive digital beauty marketplace.\r\n\r\nNot to forget, e.l.f. Beauty has been focused on improving operational efficiency and cost management to address margin pressures and operational challenges. To this end, it has implemented supply-chain optimizations, streamlined manufacturing processes and negotiated better procurement terms to reduce costs and improve profitability. These efforts are essential in enhancing overall operational resilience.\n\nGood, Bad & Ugly \u2013 What\u2019s Next for Investors?\n\nInvestor sentiment toward e.l.f. Beauty has been lukewarm, with the stock price experiencing downward pressure of late. The company grapples with pressures like intense competition from large players and rapidly changing consumer preferences. Additionally, elevated marketing investments are a concern for now.\r\n\r\nWhile caution is warranted due to valuation concerns and market challenges, e.l.f. Beauty's proactive approach to adapting to consumer trends and enhancing operational effectiveness underscores its potential for recovery and growth. The company\u2019s expansion into new product categories and international markets, coupled with strong digital sales, highlights its innovation and adaptability. \r\n\r\nAll said, current investors should hold their positions in the stock, while potential new investors might want to wait for a more favorable entry point, given its current lofty valuation. e.l.f. Beauty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "While shareholders of e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) are in the black over 5 years, those who bought a week ago aren't so fortunate",
        "content": "The e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) share price has had a bad week, falling 14%. But over five years returns have been remarkably great. Indeed, the share price is up a whopping 920% in that time. So it might be that some shareholders are taking profits after good performance. The most important thing for savvy investors to consider is whether the underlying business can justify the share price gain. Anyone who held for that rewarding ride would probably be keen to talk about it.\n\nWhile the stock has fallen 14% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals.\n\nSee our latest analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\n\nDuring the last half decade, e.l.f. Beauty became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. We can see that the e.l.f. Beauty share price is up 542% in the last three years. During the same period, EPS grew by 162% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 86% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 75.40, the market remains optimistic.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nIt is of course excellent to see how e.l.f. Beauty has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling e.l.f. Beauty stock, you should check out this FREEdetailed report on its balance sheet.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that e.l.f. Beauty shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 50% over one year. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 59% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - e.l.f. Beauty has  3 warning signs  we think you should be aware of.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

        "title": "7 Stocks That Can Still Double Your Money by 2026",
        "content": "The stock market makes it easier to achieve long-term financial goals. While any asset can get you closer to your milestones, few opportunities offer the same liquidity and choices as stocks. You can start buying stocks with as little as a dollar and build your portfolio with every paycheck.\n\nNaturally, some stocks do better than others, and it\u2019s possible to double your money within a few years if you pick the right stocks. Investors should look for companies with rising revenue and profit margins. Growth in those metrics can elevate the stock price and give investors more reasons to stick around. A company\u2019s industry, long-term catalysts and valuation also help investors to paint a better picture about a stock\u2019s potential.\n\nThe following seven growth stocks show plenty of potential to possibly double your money by 2026. These are the stocks to monitor in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational app that helps people learn new languages through guided verbal and written lessons. The app has also expanded to cover additional subjects like music and math. Although Duolingo stock is down by 10% year-to-date (YTD), it looks like a good candidate to double your money in a few years. That\u2019s because financial growth is booming, and users continue to flock to the platform.\n\nRevenue increased by 45% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter. That\u2019s always been a bright spot for the company, but profits are also expanding at a quick rate. Net income came to $27.0 million this quarter compared to a net loss of $2.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits will support a lower P/E ratio which can make the stock more attractive for long-term investors. And, Wall Street analysts are on board with Duolingo\u2019s catalysts. The stock is rated as a moderate buy with a projected 3% upside.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to soar as profit margins improve. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years, but it\u2019s still possible for the stock to double again within a few years. Meta Platforms only trades at a 28 P/E ratio while delivering exceptional financials.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% YOY in the first quarter while net income soared by more than 117% YOY. These strong numbers won\u2019t stick around forever. So, if Meta Platforms continues to post impressive numbers for several quarters, it\u2019s possible for the stock to double quickly.\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Zuckerberg has emphasized the company\u2019s commitment to efficiency. Workforce has been downsized by 10% YOY to 69,329 employees. The company has grown across all metrics, including daily active users. More than 3.24 billion people use Meta Platforms\u2019 family of apps each day. That\u2019s a 7% YOYO increase for the company\u2019s social media platforms. Meta Platforms remains a leader in the social media industry and should continue to generate billions of dollars from ads every quarter.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leader in the cybersecurity industry that generates recurring revenue from its subscription model. Corporations and small businesses invest in Crowdstrike\u2019s software to protect themselves from digital attacks. Companies can lose millions of dollars from hacks due to legal costs, lost customer trust and other factors.\n\nAlthough other cybersecurity stocks have reported decelerating revenue growth, Crowdstrike continues to charge forward. Revenue increased by 33% YOY to reach $921.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Net income came to $42.8 million compared to $0.5 million in the same quarter last year. Also, CRWD\u2019s annual recurring revenue jumped by 33% YOY to reach $3.65 billion.\n\nCurrently, Crowdstrike is rated as a strong buy among 31 Wall Street analysts. The average price target suggests an 8% upside from current levels. However, some analysts are more bullish. The highest price target of $440 per share implies that shares can gain an additional 18% from current levels.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) Nubank mobile app on white cell phone and credit card on black surface. NU stock.\n\nSource: Lais Monteiro / Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is another Wall Street favorite that has a 4% upside at the average price target and is rated as a strong buy. Analysts have several reasons to like the digital bank\u2019s prospects. First, the bank recently reached 100 million customers, and most of them are active. The stock also has momentum on its side, based on a 67% YTD gain.\n\nThe stock\u2019s momentum is justified based on first quarter results. During that quarter, revenue increased by 69% YOY. Net income jumped from $141.8 million in Q1 of 2023 to $378.8 million in this quarter. That\u2019s a 167% YOY improvement.\n\nNu Holdings offers customers access to several financial products. It offers loans, credit cards, bank accounts and brokerage accounts. The digital bank primarily serves customers in the growing Latin America region. Rising revenue and profit margins suggest that the stock can outperform the stock market and double in a few years. The Q1 of 2024 net profit margin came in at 29.7%.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics company that is a big hit among Gen Z consumers. The company uses cruelty-free ingredients in its products and offers various choices. The formula has worked well for investors, as shares are up by 37% YTD. Further, the stock is up by more than a whopping 1,000% over the past five years.\n\nShares have soared thanks to a series of superb earnings reports, including Q4 FY24 results. The company reported a 71% YOY increase in net sales during that quarter. That growth rate helped Elf Beauty exceed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. Also, the company provided upbeat guidance for fiscal 2025 that suggests high growth rates will remain.\n\nTherefore, Elf Beauty should continue to gain market share based on guidance, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise long-term investors. The cosmetics firm gained market share for the 5th consecutive year and delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) shares have almost doubled YTD. It\u2019s a big turnaround for the company that still remains well removed from its all-time high and IPO price. The fintech firm offers a range of innovative financial products that helped it deliver 40% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter.\n\nTransaction-based revenue is the largest and fastest growing segment. This component of Robinhood\u2019s business grew by 59% YOY to reach $329 million. The significant growth rate is largely attributed to crypto revenue jumping by 232% YOY to reach $126 million. Although Robinhood has more going for its business than crypto, anyone who is bullish on the digital tokens may want to give Robinhood a closer look.\n\nNet income jumped from a net loss of $511 million to a net profit of $157 million YOY. Robinhood Gold subscriptions are also picking up and were a part of the company\u2019s \u201cOther revenues\u201d segment. This part of Robinhood\u2019s business increased by 35% YOY to reach $35 million in revenue.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Close up hand holding mobile with Digital Advertising and icons, Digital Marketing concept. digital ad stocks\n\nSource: weedezign via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is on the upswing after a few flat years and an IPO gone bust. Shares are up by 9% YTD, and the search engine marketing tool\u2019s prospects are looking bright. While corporations, small businesses and solopreneurs have regularly used Semrush\u2019s products, it\u2019s becoming a more attractive investment.\n\nRevenue increased by 21% YOY in the first quarter to reach $85.8 million. Two key catalysts drove Semrush\u2019s top-line success. The first catalyst was a 10% YOY increase in the number of paying customers. Semrush has roughly 112,000 paying customers on its platform and an additional 1,125,000 registered free active customers. The latter figure is up by 27% YOY.\n\nAnother key component of Semrush\u2019s success is higher prices. SEMR can raise prices on its products and get existing customers to upgrade their accounts. That\u2019s the reason the number of Semrush customers who pay more than $10,000 annually grew by 32% YOY. Also, Semrush is profitable and delivered a $2.1 million net income in the quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD and ELF.

        "title": "3 Hyper-Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "The easiest way to build wealth is to persistently buy shares of growing companies in the stock market and be patient. There is a high correlation between a company's growth and its stock's performance over many years.\n\nAnd that's why these fool.com contributors believe MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF), and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG) are no-brainer buys right now. Read on to find out more about these highfliers, and why they could be poised for more gains.\n\nA proven winner with massive upside\n\nJohn Ballard (MercadoLibre): Latin America is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets worldwide, and this tailwind sent shares of MercadoLibre soaring over the last decade. The recent dip in the stock is an excellent buying opportunity, as the company continues to report robust growth.\n\nMercadoLibre's marketplace business has over 53 million unique active buyers. With internet penetration rates climbing across the region, there is still substantial room to grow, as noted by the 16% increase in Mercado's active buyers last quarter.\n\nBut one of the reasons MercadoLibre is such a good investment is how it uses various offerings, such as mobile payments, consumer credit, shipping services, and advertising to attract more users to its commerce ecosystem.\n\nAcross all of these products, the company's revenue grew 36% year over year in the first quarter. It should maintain these high growth rates, since the number of e-commerce users in Latin America is expected to increase 52% to 419 million by 2029. Moreover, as the e-commerce leader, MercadoLibre can gain market share and grow faster than the broader commerce market.\n\nThe stock is up 49% over the last 12 months and could repeat that performance over the next year or so. The stock's price-to-sales (P/S) valuation is currently 5.6, which is a discount to its 10.6 average P/S multiple over the trailing-10-year period.\n\nThe stock's discount reflects the negative sentiment from the recent market sell-off and the lingering uncertainty about the health of the economy. But as MercadoLibre continues to grow, the stock's P/S multiple will likely rise and deliver outstanding returns to shareholders.\n\nDisrupting the cosmetics industry\n\nJennifer Saibil (e.l.f. Beauty): Makeup has historically been a hard category to break into, but as with many other industries, the internet has changed all that. E.l.f. has disrupted the beauty status quo by targeting digitally oriented millennial shoppers with cheap, eco-conscious and trendy products. It has a social and environmental mission and stands behind it, resonating with its target population, and it takes full advantage of digital connections to create relationships with its core customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been reporting staggering growth despite inflation. Then again, it might be benefiting from inflation to some degree, since beauty enthusiasts who are used to luxury cosmetics might be giving its inexpensive products a try when they're trying to save money.\n\nSales increased 71% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended March 31), and gross margin expanded by 1.8 points to 71%. Full-year sales increased 77%. E.l.f. has been enjoying elevated sales growth over the past two years, likely as a backlash from a deceleration in 2022 when high inflation attacked the economy. Management is expecting 2025 sales to increase 21% year over year, which is still accelerated from recent historical norms.\n\nBut the e.l.f. investing thesis isn't about the past, it's about the opportunity. For all of its high growth and popularity, e.l.f. is still a small player on the beauty scene. It took in $1 billion in 2024 sales, a fraction of the likes of Estee Lauder and L'Oreal. Part of that is its low prices -- it has an average unit price of $6.50 versus more than $20 for prestige brands -- but it's also still gaining market share. When you combine low revenue with high growth, that's a recipe for a top stock.\n\nIt's already close to the top in color cosmetics, where it has the No. 1 or No. 2 spot in 18 product categories, but it's only No. 11 overall in skincare. It's investing in reaching higher, and it recently acquired skincare company Naturium to help it get there. E.l.f. has incredible momentum and potential, and investors can still buy into its story.\n\nA hidden artificial intelligence play\n\nJeremy Bowman (Sweetgreen): One of the most underrated growth stocks in the market right now might be Sweetgreen. Sweetgreen is best known as a fast-casual salad chain, and it's the leader in the fast-growing, underappreciated restaurant category.\n\nSweetgreen now has more than 200 locations around the country and is expanding quickly with plans to add 23 to 27 locations this year.\n\nSweetgreen's average unit volumes (AUV) also show that has the popularity to contend with top fast-casual chains like Chipotle as its AUV checked in at $2.9 million in its most recent quarter.\n\nRevenue jumped 26% in the first quarter driven primarily by new restaurants and same-store sales growth of 5%. Restaurant-level profitability has also improved substantially, helping drive a recovery in the stock following a disappointing performance after its late 2021 IPO.\n\nHowever, the best reason to buy Sweetgreen stock may be a technology that virtually no other restaurant can claim to have.\n\nThe company is investing in robotic kitchens that it calls Infinite Kitchen, which uses robotic systems to expedite orders and prep, creating a better experience for customers and reducing labor for employees.\n\nSweetgreen only has two units with Infinite Kitchens as of March, but it plans to open 10 to 11 more this year, and it is bullish on the technology as it has been shown to increase the average ticket and improve margins, boosting the company's financials.\n\nWhile the technology costs about $500,00 per restaurant to implement, the boost in profitability should pay off over the long run. Combine that with the company's already popular salad concept, and Sweetgreen looks like a long-term winner.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) ended the recent trading session at $210.90, demonstrating a +0.95% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.55%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.62%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.63%.\n\nShares of the cosmetics company have appreciated by 4.23% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 0.07% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 4.28%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of e.l.f. Beauty will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on August 8, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $0.90, indicating a 18.18% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $300.26 million, indicating a 38.79% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.42 per share and revenue of $1.29 billion, indicating changes of +7.55% and +25.53%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\n\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for e.l.f. Beauty should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained unchanged. e.l.f. Beauty is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note e.l.f. Beauty's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 61.06. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 24.97, so one might conclude that e.l.f. Beauty is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nOne should further note that ELF currently holds a PEG ratio of 3.79. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Cosmetics industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.82.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Cosmetics industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 158, placing it within the bottom 38% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this cosmetics company have returned +4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Cosmetics industry, to which e.l.f. Beauty belongs, has lost 9.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, e.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $0.90 per share, indicating a change of -18.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.35 indicates a change of +27% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, e.l.f. Beauty is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ELF _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $300.26 million indicates a year-over-year change of +38.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $1.29 billion and $1.52 billion estimates indicate +25.5% and +18.4% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenues of $321.14 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +71.4%. EPS of $0.53 for the same period compares with $0.42 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.47 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.81%. The EPS surprise was +51.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about e.l.f. Beauty. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Spotting Winners: e.l.f. (NYSE:ELF) And Personal Care Stocks In Q1\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q1. Today, we are looking at personal care stocks, starting with e.l.f. (NYSE:ELF).\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.1%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 7.5% below consensus. Stocks--especially those trading at higher multiples--had a strong end of 2023, but 2024 has seen periods of volatility. Mixed signals about inflation have led to uncertainty around rate cuts, and personal care stocks have had a rough stretch, with share prices down 10.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\ne.l.f. (NYSE:ELF)\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which stands for \u2018eyes, lips, face\u2019, offers high-quality beauty products at accessible price points.\n\ne.l.f. reported revenues of $321.1 million, up 71.4% year on year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 9.8%. Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts' earnings estimates but underwhelming earnings guidance for the full year.\n\n\u201cFiscal 2024 marked our strongest year of net sales growth on record, a continuation of the exceptional, consistent, category-leading growth we\u2019ve delivered,\u201d said Tarang Amin, e.l.f. e.l.f. Total Revenue\n\ne.l.f. scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth, but had the weakest full-year guidance update of the whole group.

It was a weak quarter for the company with revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts' expectations and underwhelming earnings guidance for the next quarter.\n\nMedifast posted the slowest revenue growth in the group. As expected, the stock is down 47.3% since the results and currently trades at $18.73.\n\nRead our full analysis of Medifast's results here.\n\nNature's Sunshine (NASDAQ:NATR)\n\nStarted on a kitchen table in Utah, Nature\u2019s Sunshine Products (NASDAQ:NATR) manufactures and sells nutritional and personal care products.\n\nNature's Sunshine reported revenues of $111 million, up 2.2% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations. Looking more broadly, it was a weaker quarter for the company with a miss of analysts' earnings estimates.\n\nNature's Sunshine pulled off the highest full-year guidance raise among its peers.

        "title": "Is It Worth Investing in e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about e.l.f. Beauty (ELF).\n\ne.l.f. Beauty currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.53, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.53 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 73.3% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for ELF Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for ELF\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for e.l.f. Beauty here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying e.l.f. Beauty, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ELF a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for e.l.f. Beauty, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.42.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for e.l.f. Beauty. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days. Click to get this free report\n\ne.l.f.

        "content": "Multibagger stocks can help you reach your financial goals sooner. And, many growth stocks have enjoyed incredible rallies. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the multibagger on everyone\u2019s mind. While the artificial intelligence (AI) leader can still generate higher returns for long-term investors, it\u2019s been thrown into the open.\n\nFinding hidden multibaggers can lead to higher long-term gains. Although Nvidia has gained more than 3,000% over the past five years, it\u2019s unlikely to repeat that growth over the next five years. While it\u2019s difficult for any stock to achieve those returns, it\u2019s possible to find stocks that more than double within a few years.\n\nTherefore, investors should set their horizons on companies that have rising revenue and profit margin growth. And these corporations with long-term catalysts can spark further stock gains. These three stocks fulfill those parameters, but they aren\u2019t as well-known. None of these stocks are currently in the S&P 500 and remain hidden. Let\u2019s uncover them now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an educational tech company that makes it easier for people to learn new languages. The company offers verbal and written activities to assist people on the language learning journey. The gamified experience keeps people coming back, based on Duolingo\u2019s 31.4 million daily active users. That\u2019s a 54% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Additionally, the number of monthly active users jumped by 35% YOY to reach 97.6 million.\n\nMoreover, revenue and earnings growth rates remained elevated as more people flocked to the Duolingo app. Revenue increased by 45% YOY while net income reached $27.0 million. That\u2019s a big turnaround from the company\u2019s $2.6 million net loss in the same quarter last year.\n\nNotably, Duolingo is quickly gaining momentum and is up by 37% over the past year. The stock has a high P/E ratio, but net profit margins have been soaring. Hence, higher profits and continued revenue growth can make the $8 billion corporation attractive for long-term investors.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nRestaurant stocks have taken off in recent years. Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been\u00a0 capturing plenty of attention as it\u2019s more than quadrupled over the past five years. A recent 50-for-1 stock split has made Chipotle more affordable on a price-per-share perspective, further bringing more attention to the stock.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t about Chipotle. It\u2019s about Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH). The steakhouse chain has also benefitted from the growing demand for restaurant stocks. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date (YTD), more than tripling over the past five years. Yet, Texas Roadhouse still has a reasonable 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.46% yield. Very few high-growth restaurant stocks offer a decent P/E ratio and a dividend. Most of them offer neither.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, the company reported 12.5% YOY revenue growth and 31.0% YOY net income growth in the first quarter. Comparable restaurant sales jumped by 8.4% YOY, demonstrating plenty of demand for the company\u2019s restaurants. Texas Roadhouse has 753 restaurants. The company owns 644 of those restaurants, and the remaining 109 restaurants are franchises.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is closing in on S&P 500 eligibility. The cosmetics firm has gained more than 1,300% over the past five years. Shares are up by 45% YTD amid strong financials. Elf Beauty reported 71% YOY revenue growth in Q4 of fiscal year 2024. The company has now reported 21 consecutive quarters of net sales and market growth. Also, Elf Beauty gained market share for the 5th consecutive year while other beauty firms like Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) are reporting decelerating sales growth.\n\nIn addition, Elf Beauty caters to Gen Z and other generations for using cruelty-free ingredients in its beauty products. The efforts have paid off based on recent financial results. Elf Beauty\u2019s fiscal 2025 outlook suggests the stock can gain more ground. Commentary from Tarang Amin, Elf Beauty Chief Executive Officer (CEO), suggests additional catalysts.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead, we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for e.l.f. Beauty across cosmetics, skin care and international markets,\u201d Amin stated.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, TXRH, and ELF.

        "title": "We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) Passed With Ease",
        "content": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it.\n\nView our latest analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\ne.l.f. Beauty's Improving Profits\n\nOver the last three years, e.l.f. Beauty has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Outstandingly, e.l.f. Beauty's EPS shot from US$1.17 to US$2.28, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 95%. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of e.l.f. Beauty shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 12% to 15% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this freeinteractive visualization of e.l.f. Beauty's forecast profits?\n\nAre e.l.f. Beauty Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$12b company like e.l.f. Beauty. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$250m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\n\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like e.l.f. Beauty, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe CEO of e.l.f. Beauty only received US$5.6m in total compensation for the year ending March 2023. That looks like a modest pay packet, and may hint at a certain respect for the interests of shareholders. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\n\nDoes e.l.f. Beauty Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?\n\ne.l.f. Beauty's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that e.l.f. Beauty is worth considering carefully. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified  3 warning signs for e.l.f. Beauty that you should be aware of.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "Roblox RBLX announced an expansion of its collaboration with e.l.f. Beauty ELF, making the latter the first beauty brand to test real-world commerce on the platform. This initiative aims to engage ELF's growing community in Roblox, which has accumulated more than 12 million visits and aligns with the brand's mission to bring beauty to every eye, lip and face.\r\n\r\nThe e.l.f. UP! experience on Roblox, launched in November 2023, offers users a personalized journey to become successful entrepreneurs and cultural changemakers, focusing on startups representing their passions. The experience has garnered a 96% positivity rating and has distributed more than one million free virtual items to users, becoming one of the largest providers of free limited-edition virtual items on RBLX.\r\n\r\nThe e.l.f. UP! experience is developed in partnership with eGen and Supersocial, further solidifying ELF's innovative presence in the immersive commerce space on Roblox.\r\n \r\nThis Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company recently partnered with Adidas to create a user-generated content collaboration with Jonathan Courtney, known as @WhoseTrade, featuring digital and physical products. Adidas aims to combine creativity and authenticity, targeting the virtual identities of younger consumers. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nRBLX\u2019s Recent AI Efforts to Boost Daily Active User Growth\n\nRoblox\u2019s recent collaborations are a result of its constant innovation in AI. The company has significantly advanced its AI capabilities by providing creators with a suite of generative AI tools designed for creating immersive 3D experiences. These tools, available through the free Roblox Studio app, include Assistant for 3D workspace editing, Animation Capture for face and body motion and many more.\r\n\r\nRecent AI advancements include the full rollout of Code Assist, which has saved users significant development time and automatic chat translations, and enhanced global communication on the platform. These efforts aim to make it possible for anyone to bring their ideas to life with simple commands, pushing the boundaries of content creation on Roblox.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, Roblox is working toward developing 4D generative AI, which incorporates interaction as the fourth dimension. This involves creating assets that not only have shape and color but also incorporate complex interactions, such as avatars with animations and physics-enabled objects.\r\n\r\nThese innovations are expected to boost the company\u2019s daily active users (DAUs) and total hours engaged in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RBLX\u2019s 2024 DAUs is pegged at 79,479, indicating year-over-year growth of 16.2%. The consensus mark for total hours engaged is pegged at 69,039, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.1%.\r\n\r\nHowever, RBLX faces tough competition from big players like Meta Platforms META and Qualcomm QCOM.\r\n\r\nShares of RBLX have plunged 18.9% year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s decline of 1.7%. The stock has also underperformed META, which has gained 42.6%, followed by QCOM\u2019s rise of 38.3% in the same time frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nRoblox\u2019s expanding partnerships and AI efforts act as a catalyst for the company. However, strong competition remains a major concern.\r\n\r\nRBLX\u2019s strong liquidity is a major positive. As of Mar 31, 2024, the company\u2019s net liquidity (cash, cash equivalents and investments less debt) was $2.46 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Roblox\u2019s second-quarter 2024 loss per share is pegged at 41 cents, which has narrowed by 11 cents in the past 60 days. The consensus mark for 2024 loss per share is pegged at $1.67 per share, which has narrowed by 43 cents in the past 60 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "7 Consumer Cyclical Stocks to Buy for the Starkly Lopsided Recovery",
        "content": "While the economy may have bounced back on paper from the COVID-19 disaster, it\u2019s increasingly looking like we\u2019re headed toward a K-shaped recovery. Per Investopedia, this phenomenon refers to a recovery following a recession (or in this case an acute emergency) where \u201conly certain sectors, industries, or areas of the economy recover.\u201d However, this dynamic may open opportunities in terms of consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nYes, rising inflation and elevated borrowing costs theoretically should crimp consumer demand \u2013 and they do. However, not all segments have experienced a prolonged downturn. Further, certain demographics (especially those in higher income brackets) have consistently opened their wallets. That should bode very well for specific consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nIn addition, the other, more negative component of the K-shaped recovery can also boost sentiment for retail enterprises. Yes, people are hurting but that also may translate to increased demand for discount specialists. With this mind, below are relevant consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the most boring ideas you can consider among consumer cyclical stocks to buy. In many ways, it\u2019s a \u201csafe\u201d investment. People don\u2019t just go there to shop for discretionary wants. Instead, because they offer bulk food products and other necessities, there\u2019s a fundamental reason to go through its doors. However, Costco runs tend to be adult playgrounds, which makes it an enticing opportunity.\n\nThat\u2019s because you can\u2019t deny the consistency. No, Costco doesn\u2019t generate speculator earnings performances. However, between its fiscal third quarter of 2023 and Q2 2024, the company generated an average earnings per share of roughly $4.04. This print translated to an average earnings surprise \u2013 or the magnitude by which actual EPS exceeded the consensus view \u2013 of 4.18%.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Costco posted net income of $7.17 billion or earnings of $16.14 per share. Revenue reached $253.7 billion during the period. For fiscal 2024, analysts on average believe that EPS could rise to $16.64, an improvement of 17.48% from the prior year. Further, the top line could expand by 7.29% to $259.94 billion.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEssentially a pioneer of the e-commerce phenomenon, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has over the years evolved into a disruptive technology juggernaut. Still, its core business involves facilitating the sales of goods through its online marketplace \u2013 and business is good. Indeed, Amazon is a beneficiary of the K-shaped recovery. Yes, many households are struggling but there are those who are thriving.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreasingly, the more privileged members of society are turning to Amazon for their shopping needs. Government data shows that e-commerce as a percentage of total retail transactions has been on a tear since Q2 2022. The trend might not slow down. By how fast we\u2019re moving, we could soon surpass levels seen during Q2 2020. That was when the world had to shop online.\n\nAmazon is a financial powerhouse, which makes it one of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy. In the TTM period, net income reached $37.68 billion or earnings of $3.58 per share. Revenue landed at $590.74 billion in the cycle. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate that EPS could rise to $4.63. If so, that would be up almost 60%.\n\nOn the top line, sales might see a 13.26% lift to just over $651 billion. It\u2019s difficult to bet against AMZN so I wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy mobile app open screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA clear reflection of the K-shaped recovery among consumer cyclical stocks to buy comes from Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). Sort of an Amazon for pets, Chewy is an online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products. Now, Americans love their four-legged friends, I get that. However, it\u2019s not just a sentiment but rather an economic reality.\n\nDespite the ravages of inflation and high borrowing costs, the U.S. pet industry continues to thrive. The latest data from the American Pet Products Association shows that total industry expenditures hit $147 billion last year. So it was always odd to me that CHWY stock was such a poor performer up until recently. Fortunately, the company released some strong earnings results in Q1 and CHWY rebounded.\n\nSince the start of the year, shares have gained over 30%. To be sure, analysts see risks in the near term. Still, because American pet owners have consistently stood by their animals, I think we could see a strong result this year.\n\nOn paper, experts are looking for fiscal 2024 EPS to hit 25 cents. If so, that would be a massive 175.33% leap from last year. Also, revenue could hit $11.99 billion, a projected increase of 7.59%.\n\nelf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother possible beneficiary of the K-shaped recovery is beauty care specialist elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF). Technically speaking, elf is a cosmetics brand so it might not seem like a perfect idea among consumer cyclical stocks to buy. However, the company\u2019s public profile \u2013 provided by Google Finance \u2013 states that over half of its revenue stems from its website.\n\nThe juxtaposition of ELF stock is intriguing. On one hand, a cosmetics firm shouldn\u2019t do well in a period of rising prices and elevated borrowing costs. People are legitimately struggling. On the other hand, the favorable component of the K-shape is performing quite well. They\u2019re socially mobile and they\u2019re going on vacations and having a grand ole time. These folks may be boosting elf\u2019s business.\n\nIndeed, ELF stock gained over 46% since the beginning of the year. Still, there could be even more room to grow over the long run. During the TTM period, the company posted net income of $127.66 million or $2.21 per share. Revenue in the cycle reached $1.02 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts seek EPS of $3.43, an increase of 55.09%. Further, sales may rise 26.77% to reach $1.3 billion.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the well-known brands within the broad consumer cyclical space, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) primarily focuses on apparel retail. Together with its subsidiaries, TJX operates as an off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Fundamentally, it enjoys several relevant avenues.\n\nFirst, the home-buying surge during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic should benefit the company\u2019s home goods unit. Presumably, a great many first-time homebuyers won\u2019t have too many funds available to spend. So, a discount retailer represents an ideal choice. Second, the apparel line could see increased demand as society normalizes.\n\nFor instance, if return-to-office mandates accelerate, that could translate to increased demand for business casual attire. Again, that may benefit TJX. Encouragingly, the company\u2019s average earnings surprise has come out to a very decent 7.55%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts see a 7% rise in EPS to $4.13. On the top line, sales could rise 3.3% to $56.02 billion. The company also offers a forward yield of 1.36%, making it a conservative and simultaneously relevant idea among consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an empty restaurant dining room\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen investors think about consumer cyclical stocks to buy, they\u2019re generally thinking about discretionary retailers. While that\u2019s a big part of the narrative, it doesn\u2019t always have to involve buying stuff. Consumer cyclical also includes the restaurant industry, which brings up Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI). Mainly, I\u2019d say that Darden is known for its Olive Garden label.\n\nHowever, what makes the company intriguing is that last year, it completed its acquisition of Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group. Under the deal, Darden now controls Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, a premium restaurant. Therefore, Darden may be one of the most balanced ideas for consumer cyclical stocks to buy. For those who are benefitting from the K-shaped recovery, you have Ruth\u2019s Chris.\n\nOn the other hand, those on the downward sloping segment of the K-shape will likely go to Olive Garden. I\u2019m not casting aspersions \u2013 just calling the situation how it is. Whatever the case, Darden has been performing well, with an average earnings surprise of 2.55% in the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Darden posted net income of $1.03 billion or $8.53 per share. Revenue hit $11.39 billion. For the current fiscal year, analysts see EPS rising 7.3% to $9.53. Revenue may bump up 3.9% to hit $11.83 billion.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) storefront of a five below, FIVE Stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there\u2019s one name on this list of consumer cyclical stocks to buy that\u2019s catered to the negative side of the K-shaped recovery, it\u2019s Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Before getting into the granularity, on a broader level, Five offers a compelling business model. It\u2019s a discount retailer but unlike the pure-play dollar stores, FIVE features products that go up to $5, hence the name.\n\nAlso, the company provides a selection of items that range between $6 to $25. So, it\u2019s not just the down-on-their-luck folks that shop at Five; many others \u2013 especially those looking for a bargain \u2013 do as well. Unfortunately for investors, relevance alone hasn\u2019t been enough. Since the start of the year, FIVE stock dropped more than 49% of equity value.\n\nAgainst bottom-line targets, the company missed analysts\u2019 expectations in the last two quarters. In the TTM period, net income came out to $295.1 million or $5.31 per share. Revenue reached $3.64 billion. For the year, experts are now seeing a 3.5% erosion in EPS to $5.22.\n\nThe saving grace may come from the top line. Analysts believe sales may rise 8.1% to $3.85 billion. It\u2019s a falling knife yet I got to believe the company will make a turnaround.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Most investors gravitate toward the\u00a0Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 when they think about stock market indices, but it is also worth considering Russell 2000 stocks to buy. Some stock screeners let you shortlist stocks from either of these indices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, not every stock screener lets you filter\u00a0Russell 2000 stocks.\n\nThe Russell 2000 is filled with lesser-known stocks. In some cases, it\u2019s best off, as a bunch of the stocks in the Russell 2000 are losing value. The index is flat year-to-date and has only gained 30% over the past five years. It\u2019s a low bar to clear for many stocks, and most of the Russell 2000 stocks don\u2019t hit the mark.\n\nHowever, some stocks in the index crush the stock market and still have reasonable valuations.\u00a0Super MicroComputer (NASDAQ:SMCI) was in the Russell 2000 before it was added to the S&P 500. That stock is up by more than 4,000% over the past five years, and a few stocks in the Russell 2000 ended up with quadruple-digit gains within a few years. Here are the three Russell 2000 stocks to buy:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is flat year-to-date but has gained 55% over the past year. The search engine marketing tool is a popular resource for many small businesses, content creators, and corporations. The firm has roughly 112,000 paying customers who have subscription plans.\n\nMost of Semrush\u2019s revenue is recurring. Annual recurring revenue came to $354.2 million in Q1 2024, which is up by 21% year-over-year. Revenue also increased by 21% year-over-year to reach $85.8 million for the quarter. The company uses artificial intelligence to strengthen its core product and to incentivize current customers to upgrade their plans. Semrush anticipates 20% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024. Based on guidance, full-year revenue growth should range from 19% to 20%.\n\nSemrush recently became profitable and delivered a\u00a0GAAP net income of $2.14 million, compared to a net loss of $9.86 million in the same quarter last year. Rising profits should lead to a more attractive valuation for long-term investors.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) enjoyed quite the run during the pandemic but remains more than 80% removed from its all-time high. While the 5-year chart and a 27% year-to-date loss don\u2019t look promising, Upwork may be on the way to a recovery.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a 31 P/E ratio and is delivering higher profits. Revenue increased by 19% year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter, while\u00a0net income was up by 7% year-over-year. Profit margins should expand considerably in the upcoming quarters since Upwork\u2019s advertising segment is growing faster than any other part of the company\u2019s business. Upwork also surpassed 100,000 active Freelancer Plus subscriptions, which\u00a0represents a 76% year-over-year improvement.\n\nStory continues\n\nRemote work is here to stay, and more people want flexibility with how and when they work. Upwork offers that flexibility by connecting freelancers with job opportunities. The freelance marketplace stands to benefit greatly as more people pick up side hustles and seek ways to work from home.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is one of the Russell 2000 stocks that has comfortably outperformed the stock market. It demonstrates what can happen if investors dig deeper into the index and find promising opportunities. Shares are up by 46% year-to-date and have soared more than 1,300% over the past five years.\n\nElf Beauty won\u2019t remain in the Russell 2000 for long, as it will\u00a0join the Russell 1000 on June 28th. The cosmetics firm produces beauty products that use cruelty-free ingredients, and it\u2019s been a big hit with Gen Z. The company recently reported 71% year-over-year net sales growth in Q4 FY24 and gained market share for the 5th consecutive year. Elf Beauty also had its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales growth.\n\nLeadership indicated that Elf Beauty\u2019s high growth should continue into fiscal 2025, and Wall Street analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. Elf Beauty is currently rated as a\u00a0Strong Buy, and the highest price target of $250 per share suggests a potential 23% upside.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "content": "Consumers have rarely been under the kind of pressure they face today. Unemployment in May crept up to 4% while inflation stood at 3.3%, unchanged from the month before. With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, the cost of borrowing remains high.\n\nThat\u2019s like why the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index fell 5% from April. Many of the jobs being created are just part-time employment forcing families to work two jobs (or more) just to make ends meet. Consumers are forced to turn to using credit cards but delinquencies are on the rise. The Fed says 9% of all credit cards and 8% of auto loans are delinquent.\n\nIt\u2019s a gloomy backdrop and stands at odds with the go-go sentiment on Wall Street. As the market indices hit new all-time highs, consumers are whistling past the graveyard.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors, though, can use that to their advantage. While shoppers are reining in their spending to focus on basics, it is uneven as a number of businesses show strength. Below are seven top consumer stocks to buy now that are profiting from the dicey economy.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) continues to prove its resilience in all markets. It remains profitable even as sales slumped 6.5% due to same-store sales falling 6.1%. Earnings rose to $1.20 per share from $1.15 a year ago. Best Buy stock, however, is up 15% year-to-date and 25% high since reporting earnings one month ago.\n\nThere is good reason for the optimism. The PC market is basically at rock bottom with the potential for a significant sales boost to come. That\u2019s because artificial intelligence (AI) PCs are starting to hit store shelves. They promise to revitalize the market with new power and capabilities that hasn\u2019t been seen in many years.\n\nThe latest AI PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be released in the coming months and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be bringing its AI-powered M4 chip to all MacBooks.\n\nComputers still account for a large percentage of Best Buy\u2019s revenue. Although segment revenue fell 13% in the first quarter, there could be a surge on the horizon. But even if it doesn\u2019t materialize, Best Buy has shown it is able to navigate treacherous waters profitably.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading global online travel agent Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the next consumer stocks to buy now. Despite a glum economy, travel remains a bright spot. Certainly the \u201crevenge travel\u201d phenomenon that followed the pandemic has run its course but the industry is still forecasting growth. While demand this year will be as robust as it was in 2023, consumers are seeking out maximum value for their dollars spent. Booking\u2019s family of platforms helps them achieve it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking operates some of the largest travel platforms in the world, including Agoda, Priceline.com and Kayak. It offers an extensive network of properties in almost every country globally making it a natural to attract the largest percentage of travelers.\n\nGlobal room nights increased 17% in 2023 from the year before and are now 24% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. They increased another 9% in the first quarter while rental car days jumped 11% and airline ticket growth soared 33% from the year-ago period.\n\nTravel could very well be pinched if the economy deteriorates further. If inflation doesn\u2019t start heading appreciably lower and the Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates or not as much as expected, it could hurt travel and tourism. But for those who can and will travel, turning to Booking Holdings for the opportunity will make it smooth sailing.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nFootwear specialist Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) stumbled over the acquisition last year of the HeyDude brand but quickly picked itself up and dusted itself off. Due to the ongoing strength of its core plastic shoe, CROX stock is up 65% in 2024 and has doubled off its 52-week low.\n\nIt seems hard to believe the staying power of Crocs shoes. Initially a favorite amongst healthcare workers and others who were on their feet all day, the brand found favor in all segments of the market, even internationally. Sales in foreign markets are growing faster than domestic sales and have almost reached parity.\n\nAt the start of the year I noted how robust Crocs brand sales were and highlighted the stock\u2019s very attractive valuations. \u201cThis is a deeply discounted stock with a still-valuable brand name that can run higher,\u201d I wrote at the time but the case remains true today.\n\nDespite the phenomenal run-up in the stock, Crocs still trades at 11 times trailing earnings and estimates, goes for twice its sales and a bargain-basement 11x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces. CROX stock will wear out a lot of shoe leather as it runs higher from here.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAftermarket auto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a stock primed to take advantage of this dicey economy and any recovery that follows.\n\nElevated inflation and interest rates have taken a toll on both new and used car sales. Although prices are down from their post-pandemic record, financing a new car is still too expensive. Dealers are resorting to incentives once again to lure in buyers and reduce rising inventories. It\u2019s not much better for used car values either as those dealer incentives keep buyers away from used car lots.\n\nIt makes it better just to keep your existing car working. The average age of all vehicles on the road has crept up to 12.6 years but for cars it stands at 14 years. Buying parts to keep them working is keeping Genuine Parts busy. It operates the NAPA Auto Parts chain of retail stores.\n\nGlobal automotive sales rose 2% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion with segment profits rising 3.2% to $273 million.\n\nThe auto parts stock raised its full-year earnings guidance to $9.88 per share at the midpoint from its previous estimate of $9.80 per share. With the stock up less than 2% in 2024 and trading at just 13 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates Genuine Parts is a solid consumer stock to buy.\n\nSkechers (SKX) photo of man practicing parkour, jumping on tall cement wall in black sneakers\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/areporter\n\nAnother footwear specialist deserving your attention is sneaker-maker Skechers (NYSE:SKX). The company is targeting $10 billion in sales eventually and while the North American market remains an important component of that, it is sales to international markets that will push it over the threshold.\n\nForeign sales of Skechers sneakers represent 65% of total revenue of $2.25 billion, which was a company record. They are also growing twice as fast as domestic sales, 15.2% versus 7.8%. More importantly, the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market is what is firing that growth, here and abroad. That\u2019s key because DTC sales cut out the middleman and boost profits. Gross profit margins on DTC sales stands at 65.7% whereas the wholesale market is 44.7%.\n\nThe growth also suggests Skechers hasn\u2019t lost any consumer mindshare over the years. They still find its footwear desirable and are willing to pay up for it.\n\nSkechers stock is up 15% year-to-date and more than 56% above recent lows. Yet shares still trade at an attractive 11 times earnings estimates, less than twice sales and 17x FCF.\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy mobile app open screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, U.S. owners will spend $150.6 billion on their pets this year, up 2.4% from the $147 billion they spent in 2023. The greaterst percentage will be spent on food and treats, or some $64.4 billion, with another $38.3 billion going to veterinarian care and products.\n\nThat plays to the strengths of online petcare retailer Chewy (NASDAQ:CHWY). The majority of its sales come from pet food and treats but also supplies, pet medications and petcare products. The retailer is also expanding into new channels such as veterinary clinics, which hold the promise of higher margins. In April, Chewy opened its first two clinics and more are expected soon.\n\nBecause of the ongoing trend towards humanizing our pets, consumers are willing to spend more and pay up, whether its for food, toys or vet care. It provides a large, motivating force behind Chewy stock. Shares have bounced 70% off their 52-week low but with renewed sales strength the stock should go higher still.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt looked as though e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) had run its course. The cosmetics and beauty care company had tripled in value last year but after starting off 2024 strong, stumbled hard. Shares lost more than a quarter of their value. That\u2019s now a thing of the past. ELF stock is up 42% year-to-date and should keep charging ahead.\n\nAs I noted last month before the rebound, teens view e.l.f. Beauty as the No. 1 cosmetics brand in the country. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s Taking Stock With Teens semi-annual survey, e.l.f. has a 38% share of the market, 16 percentage points more than the next leading brand. And teens are spending more money on cosmetics than at any time since 2018. The survey found teens are spending an average of $339 on cosmetics.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $205 per share and though it looks expensive at 98 times earnings, that very much in line with its average over the past five years. It is somewhat elevated over the period since it went public but a good argument could be made that it is worth the premium being charged.\n\nParticularly during difficult economic times, cosmetics are an items consumers are willing to splurge on. e.l.f. Beauty remains a smart consumer stock to buy today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

        "content": "Today\u2019s market environment has led to the emergence of many overvalued stocks, with major indices reaching new highs almost weekly. In such high-spirited times, investors often ignore fundamental principles and become susceptible to hype trains that promise quick wealth from rapidly rising stock prices. The temptation is particularly strong in the current bullish market, as hype eclipses caution, leading to potential pitfalls in investing decisions.\n\nTo some extent, I understand the appeal. In a market where optimism reigns supreme, and headlines focus on \u201cunprecedented\u201d gains, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) comes to mind, and investors may feel compelled to chase after the next big thing. However, such enthusiasm often blinds one to the fundamental principles of investing\u2014valuations, growth prospects, and risk management.\n\nSure, strictly following the basic \u201crules of investing\u201d might mean missing out on some once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. However, remaining prudent and making thoughtful decisions will ultimately save you from multiple cases of major disappointment and potential losses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn this article, I have selected three cases where investors seem to be caught up in the hype and neglect the essential fundamentals. These three overvalued stocks may face notable downside risks, potentially resulting in significant losses for investors.\n\nAll linked charts are courtesy of Koyfin.com\n\nOvervalued Stocks: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock Price\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first overvalued stock that I think you should avoid at its current levels is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). Costco has gathered immense investor favor due to its wonderful membership-based warehouse retail model and consistent growth trajectory. In fact, it has always been an overly-hyped stock with a cult-like following.\n\nMore specifically, investors have historically been drawn to Costco for several reasons. For starters, its membership-driven revenue model provides a steady cash flow, while its focus on bulk sales and efficient supply chain management leads to healthy profit margins. Also, Costco\u2019s expansion efforts, both domestically and internationally, have always garnered enthusiastic market reception\u2014evidenced by eager customers forming lines ahead of new store openings.\n\nTo depict Costco\u2019s growth trajectory, the company has increased its net sales and earnings per share (EPS) at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% and 14.8% over the past five years. The fact that the company continues to grow in the double digits despite being quite mature, with decades of rapid growth behind it, is quite commendable.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Costco\u2019s valuation at over 50 times earnings appears exorbitant. It not only significantly exceeds its industry peers but is also objectively hard to justify, especially considering consensus estimates projecting an EPS CAGR of about 9% over the next five years.\n\nWingstop (WING) The logo for Wingstop is displayed on a building wall.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is another Wall Street darling currently trading at an absurd valuation. The hype surrounding Wingstop stock over the past year has been unreal, with shares gaining about 125% during this period. Does Wingstop enjoy some great qualities that merit a premium valuation? Absolutely. Does this mean the stock deserves to trade at about 22 times and 125 times this year\u2019s expected sales and EPS, respectively? No way!\n\nRegarding why Wingstop stock likely warrants a modest premium, it\u2019s because its growth has indeed been very strong over the years. The company has consistently reported higher same-store sales, driven by operational efficiencies, an effective digital strategy, and a strong focus on improving customer experience through technology. Along with constantly expanding its location footprint, Wingstop\u2019s revenues and EPS have grown at a CAGR of 22.8% and 23.1% over the past decade.\n\nThese growth metrics are certainly impressive but don\u2019t explain how Wingstop stock can support its current valuation multiples. Consensus estimates see EPS growth of 23% over the next five years, which is indeed a strong forecast, indicating sustained growth ahead. However, even this robust estimate falls short of supporting the stock\u2019s triple-digit P/E ratio. As such, I think it is one of the most overvalued stocks right now.\n\nE.L.F. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.L.F. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has caught the attention of both investors and consumers. Despite operating in the fiercely competitive global cosmetics industry, dominated by giants like L\u2019Or\u00e9al (OTCMKTS:LRLCY), E.L.F. Beauty has carved out a niche by offering high-quality, affordable cosmetics.\n\nThe company\u2019s value proposition to compete against the well-established industry leaders centers on providing trendy beauty products at affordable prices, particularly resonating with younger demographics. E.L.F. has utilized social media and influencer marketing in a smart way to expand brand awareness and drive sales. This strategy has clearly paid off, as evidenced by an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 48% in revenues over the past three years.\n\nThe problem, however, is that with such robust growth and impressive penetration into a challenging market, E.L.F. has become an over-hyped stock. Investors have been willing to pay sky-high multiples to take part in what could be a multi-decade growth story in the cosmetics industry. Thus, I believe that ELF stock has now become rather overvalued.\n\nIn fact, demand for shares is so high that ELF stock has doubled over the past year and is currently trading at about 63 times this year\u2019s expected EPS. While E.L.F.\u2019s growth story could indeed play out successfully, which could justify the stock\u2019s current valuation, there is simply little to no room for error today. The lack of a margin of safety could translate to a heavy downside should the company\u2019s growth slow down. Thus, caution is warranted.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Finding the best mid-cap stocks to buy in 2024 is no walk in the park. While these promising companies often have growing revenues and profits, that does not always last. Moreover, even if the stocks are above a certain market capitalization threshold that won\u2019t always translate into less volatility.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2028, there exists several up and coming companies poised for significant gains. This will be a result of secular tailwinds in the economy and favorable industry trends to drive growth. For investors, this segment of the market can be a sweet spot of growth potential without the heightened risk associated with smaller, more volatile companies.\n\nWith a balanced approach and healthy risk management practices, investors can position their portfolios for success over the next few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, let\u2019s unpack the top 3 mid-cap stocks to buy that could make early investors filthy rich by 2028!\n\nQualys (QLYS) A Qualys sign hanging on a corporate office in Silicon Valley.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions, has established itself as a key player in the cybersecurity industry. As cyber threats continue to escalate globally, Qualys is well positioned for expansion through 2030.\n\nQualys is one of the top under-the-radar companies in 2024. With a market capitalization of approximately $5 billion, the company is an ideal candidate for the best mid-cap stocks to buy. Qualys\u2019 cloud-based platform, TruRisk, continues to gain traction and is driving its revenue growth and profitability in 2024. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 12% year over year to $145.8 million. Earnings per share swelled 35% year over year to $1.05 per share, driven by strong operational execution. Its risk-based approach and comprehensive suite of offerings from vulnerability management to web security is driving customer satisfaction. Moreover, its recent partnership with Oracle\u2019s Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has further strengthened TruRisk\u2019s appeal across multi-cloud environments. Qualys\u2019 strong margins and growing free cash flow profile is also a positive sign for its future growth.\n\nDycom Industries (DY) A digital illustration of the telecom industry.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDycom Industries (NYSE:DY), a key provider of specialty contract services to the telecommunications industry, stands out as one of the best mid-cap stocks to buy in June.\n\nDY stock plays a crucial role in the ongoing expansion and upgrade of telecommunication networks. The increased demand for high-speed data connectivity, and the continued rollout of 5G technology is an extremely positive tailwind. Its extensive experience and established relationships with major telecom providers, makes it well positioned to capitalize on these trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings have skyrocketed over the last 3 years, and growth doesn\u2019t look to be slowing down anytime soon. In its latest quarterly financial results, revenue increased 9% year over year to $1.14 billion. Net earnings increased 21% year over year to $62.6 million, or $2.12 per share. Moreover, contracted revenue growth remains robust, driven by strong demand for the deployment of high-capacity fiber optic networks. These positive developments certainly make DY stock a candidate to surge 50% or more by 2028.\n\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (XMMO) Invesco logo in blue with mountain image\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:XMMO) is a great investment choice for those seeking diversified exposure to the top mid-cap stocks to buy. While not exactly a stock, this ETF seeks to track the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Momentum Index.\n\nInvesco S&P MidCap Momentum ETF is a hidden gem among the top ETFs to significantly outperform through 2028. It is having an incredible year thus far, up 29% as compared to the S&P 500\u2019s rising 15%. The ETF\u2019s strategy is focused on selecting companies with strong price momentum, which is often indicative of underlying business fundamentals and growth potential. Notable companies include Lennox International (NYSE:LII), Emcor Group (NYSE:EME), and Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF). Additionally, its expense ratio of 0.34% is relatively cost effective when considering its performance in comparison to other ETFs on the market. While this can be true in the present moment, it\u2019s important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. Therefore, investors should only invest what they can afford to potentially lose.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com - On June 28th, ELF Beauty Inc (NYSE:ELF) is set to transition from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 as part of the Russell US Index Reconstitution, a shift which could bring about a significant liquidity event for the company, according to analysts at Piper.\n\nAlthough some pre-positioning, including incremental selling and shorting, has been occurring over the past several months, any negative movement is expected to be minimal and short-lived.\n\nPiper analysts estimate that there will be approximately 4.8 million net shares of ELF Beauty for sale, valued at around $900 million, at the close of June 28th. Shares have been shorted leading up to the reconstitution date as funds prepare to unwind their positions on the rebalance effective date.\n\nPrevious trends show that short interest for ELF Beauty has been increasing over the past few months compared to early 2024. However, the analysts suspect that the incremental shares shorted might not be enough to meet the 4.8 million shares for sale from the rebalance.\n\nWhile Piper analysts expect short interest to continue trending higher in June, they do not have full confidence that the 4.8 million will be met entirely. As such, they advise investors to be cautious of potential stock weakness, but they also believe that pre-positioning is likely to minimize that weakness.\n\nDespite potential volatility, Piper analysts remain optimistic about ELF Beauty, considering it their top idea. They believe that even if there is some short-term movement, the stock will bounce back in the coming months as it reverts to trading on its strong fundamentals.\n\nPiper retained their Overweight rating with a price target of $210.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nELF Beauty's transition from Russell 2000 to Russell 1000: Piper analysts weigh in\n\nAirbus cuts key targets and takes hefty Space charge\n\nBoeing 737 MAX crash victim families ask judge to name corporate monitor\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Best Long-lasting Perfume for Men Under $500",
        "content": "In this article, we will talk about the Best Long-lasting Perfume for Men Under $500. For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 25 Best Long-lasting Perfumes for Men Under $500.\n\nAs stated earlier in our article \"15 Best Everyday Colognes in 2024,\" the global perfume market was valued at $50.85 billion in 2022 and has been estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% between 2023 and 2030. Most significantly, the market for luxury perfumes was estimated to be worth $13.66 billion in 2022 and is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2023 to 2029. The mentioned data was provided in our article, \"11 Best Travel-Size Fragrances For Your Next Vacation.\"\n\ne.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)\u2019s Financial Performance Over The Years:\n\nOne of the \u201cBiggest Skincare Companies In The US\u201d, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), which provides high-quality cosmetics and skincare at lower prices than its competitors, has released its Q4 FY2024 earnings. According to the mass market makeup company, net sales in the year ending March 31, 2024, increased by an incredible 77% to $1,023.9 million over the same time the previous year, breaking the billion barrier and exceeding Wall Street expectations. Surpassing forecasts, it grew market share in its cosmetics and skincare products to 10.5% and 1.6%, respectively. As they exceeded in each of their three pillars - color cosmetics, skincare, and international expansion - Q4 was the 21st consecutive quarter in which Elf has gained market share. Overall, the growth was strong in this quarter.\n\nElf stock has surged more than 79% over the previous year and has already increased by over 37% in the current year as of June 14th, 2024, outperforming S&P 500's 14% gain over the year. At the end of 2022 and the start of 2023, the stock was at $55.30 before soaring to $217.40 on March 1, 2024, ahead of the Q4 FY2024 earnings report due to positive analysts prediction and average buy rating. The trailing PE ratio stands at 87.16, while the forward PE ratio is 57.14. EPS (TTM) is $2.22. Currently, the stock is trading at $192.63 per share.\n\nThe company's revenue has also experienced continuous growth over the years, reaching record breaking levels so far this year. Elf\u2019s annual revenue has surged significantly by 76.92% YoY, rising from $578.84 million in 2023 to $1.02 billion in 2024, solidifying its position as a strong company among other cosmetic companies such as Estee Lauder and Coty.\n\nThere are several apparent reasons for Elf\u2019s growth. E.l.f. has gained popularity among Gen Alpha and Gen Z customers due to its widespread availability and affordable price point. The $333 million acquisition of skincare firm Naturium in October 2023 has increased the company's young customer base. The CEO of Elf, Tarang Amin explained: \u201cE.l.f. Skin has a similar consumer profile to E.l.f. color cosmetics; it\u2019s primarily Gen Z and women,\u201d \u201cNaturium has a very different proposition. The price points are higher, about $18, and the consumer set skews millennial.\u201d\u00a0 (The brand\u2019s user base is 40% men.) Therefore, Elf's marketing to a variety of age groups is one of the factors contributing to its success.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Elf has internationally expanded its business. Amin stated that in Q4, net sales from overseas growth increased 115% YoY, accounting for 16% of net sales as opposed to 13% the year before. This growth was led by countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, which have experienced \u201cterrific growth\u201d. Amin added that these are among Elf\u2019s \u201clargest global markets,\u201d. E.l.f. is now the number-four cosmetics brand in Canada and number-six in the UK. However, he thinks the business has the opportunity to expand in other areas, such as Saudi Arabia, Australia, France, and Italy. During the results call, Amin declared that the business will be entering Mexican Sephora stores to compete with industry giants like Maybelline and L'Or\u00e9al and to explore more overseas markets.\n\nThirdly, Elf has been actively marketing on social media. According to Amin, the company's website and social media platforms account for around 25% of its total revenue. The business collaborated with creators like Mikayla Nogueira Hawken in the early days of TikTok and Twitch. \u201cOn TikTok, our first hashtag challenge had 3 billion views. I think our last one had 15 billion views,\u201d Amin says. Furthermore, he mentioned that E.l.f. is a well-known and expanding brand on Roblox, which helps it stay relevant with Gen Alpha gamers.\n\nAmrita Roy, an analyst believes that \u201cthere are three key drivers of their outperformance across their growth pillars that include a) their strong value proposition of delivering high-quality products for every eye, lip, and skin at compelling price points, with the average price point of $6.50, as compared to $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetic brands and $20 for prestige brands, b) a culture of product innovation, where it focuses on launching enduring product franchises, such as extending their Power Grip franchise into setting spray category with the launch of Power Grip Dewy setting spray at $10, compared to $38 for prestige equivalent, resulting in double-digit lift in sales, and c) engaging with their customers through unique and creative moments with their disruptive marketing engine, allowing them to reach new audiences beyond Gen Zs and creating brand awareness.\u201d.\n\nElf's digital consumption increased by a noteworthy 70% in comparison to the previous year, with digital channels now making up 22% of overall consumption, up from 18% in the previous year. The growth of their Beauty Squad Loyalty Program, which now has 4.8 million members compared to 4.5 million the previous quarter and accounts for 80% of e.l.f.cosmetics.com sales, has to do with this growth. Furthermore, the company is concentrating on increasing its retail footprint, capitalizing on the success of its Target strategy, in which it enjoys a leadership position with more than 19% market share. Elf intends to grow its presence at CVS, Walmart, and Ulta Beauty during the year to acquire more market share, particularly in the skincare area.\n\nI strongly believe that Elf\u2019s sales growth is also due to its strategy of creating affordable alternatives to luxury cosmetics, commonly referred to as \u201cdupes\u201d. This is likely why Elf\u2019s competitors and high-end cosmetics companies such as Estee Lauder as well as Bath and Body Works experienced declines and noticeable slowing in pace of growth, respectively. L\u2019Oreal also faced this \u201cpost-pandemic inflation\u201d period. This is because consumers are prioritizing need-based goods. Estee Lauder had a 10% decrease in revenue growth YoY in 2023, further declining 3.52% from 2023 to the last 12 months. Similarly, L\u2019Oreal has also faced tough years; it grew at a rate of 13.34% between 2020 and 2021. However, this growth rate slowed down sharply from 18.51% in 2021 to 7.61% in 2023, indicating a downturn in the industry as a whole. ELF, however, remains an exception due to the aforementioned reason.\n\nLooking ahead, the company aims to increase revenue by 21% YoY to $1.24 billion, with adjusted EBITDA of $287 million, representing a 22% YoY increase with a margin of 23%. The analysts' projected revenue of 27% is higher than the management's 21% prediction.\n\nAt the same time, elite managers are pouring money into this stock. In Q1 FY 2024, 33 hedge funds reported holding shares in e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), although a decrease from 34 funds in the previous quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder in the company, with 641,400 shares worth $125.73 million.\n\nClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cEncouragingly, we are seeing underlying improvements from companies we do own in the portfolio, with several being recent portfolio additions or subjects of repositioning work executed in 2023.\n\nThe first quarter represented another period of fruitful new idea generation with nine new investments. Consistent with historical practice, these initial investments represent modest position sizes that we intend to build over time.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), in the consumer staples sector, is a mass cosmetics and skincare provider in the U.S., selling professional-quality makeup and skincare products at an attractive price point relative to legacy brands. With a significant online, direct-to-consumer presence and clean product ingredients, the company has been a strong market share gainer with multiple levers to sustain elevated growth.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven the significant opportunities available in the cosmetics and skincare segments, and constant revenue growth, it seems like e.l.f.'s growth potential remains substantial. I appreciate how the business is leveraging remarkable marketing experiences in addition to strong product innovation to increase interaction online and in its physical retail locations across the US and abroad to reach new markets. A high P/E ratio and earnings boost further indicate that the market is robust and that the company's growth has upside potential. I feel the stock is reasonably priced in terms of risk-reward, making it a \"buy.\".\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "The stock market is filled with many opportunities. Some investments have helped people accumulate generational wealth, and the most successful mega-cap stocks are quite popular. These tech giants make up the Magnificent Seven, and they\u2019ve been propelling the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new heights for several years.\n\nInvestors can even buy an ETF that specifically focuses on these seven companies. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ:MAGS) has outperformed both indices with a 35% year-to-date gain.\n\nWhile investing in reliable, well-established corporations can lead to solid gains, it\u2019s possible to generate a higher upside with low-key stocks. Hidden gems that go relatively unnoticed can deliver solid long-term returns.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMany of these under-the-radar stocks to buy have lower valuations than the most popular mega-cap stocks. They also aren\u2019t members of the S&P 500, but it\u2019s possible for them to get added in the future. Investors looking for opportunities hidden in plain sight may want to consider these high-potential growth stocks.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a fintech firm specializing in \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later\u201d solutions. The stock has a 37 P/E ratio and a $470 million market cap. It\u2019s almost quadrupled year-to-date as more people create their accounts. Sezzle offers flexible financing where you can make four monthly payments without accruing any interest. You also won\u2019t have to worry about any hard credit checks.\n\nThe small fintech company has been delivering exceptional financial performances. Revenue increased by 35.5% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 2024 while net income soared by 364.3% year-over-year. Sezzle closed out the quarter with a 17.0% net profit margin.\n\nThe financial results prompted Sezzle to set ambitious guidance. Guidance for fiscal 2024 GAAP net income went from $20.0 million to $30.0 million. A 50% jump in a single quarter demonstrates strong momentum. Sezzle also raised its revenue guidance and now projects 25% YOY growth instead of 20% YOY revenue growth.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has been comfortably outpacing the stock market for several years. Shares are up 51% year-to-date and have gained more than 1,500% over the past five years. The company has impressed investors with high revenue growth.\n\nThe cosmetics firm reported 71% YOY revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Leadership cited retailer and e-commerce channels as two growth catalysts. Those initiatives helped e.l.f. Beauty gain market share for the 5th consecutive year and also marked the 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth. The company also generated $14.5 million in GAAP net income and had a profit margin just shy of 5% for the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.l.f. Beauty is winning over younger generations and has plenty of runway for additional growth. Leadership suggested that growth will remain elevated in fiscal 2025. As other beauty firms report slower revenue growth, e.l.f. stands to gobble up market share and reward long-term investors.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a fintech firm that offers bank accounts, loans, investment portfolios, credit cards and other resources to strengthen your finances. Shares have had a rough stretch, dropping by 34% year-to-date. However, the company isn\u2019t likely to stay down for long.\n\nThe firm has been reporting profitable quarters, including $88 million in GAAP net income in Q1 2024. That\u2019s a significant turnaround from a $34.4 million GAAP net loss in the same quarter last year. SoFi also posted $645 million in revenue, a 37% YOY improvement.\n\nMemberships continued to grow steadily and reached 8.1 million. That\u2019s a 44% improvement compared to the same quarter last year. The lending segment contributed to roughly half of the company\u2019s GAAP net revenue. This segment\u2019s revenue dropped by 2% YOY. Any pickup in the lending segment can result in meaningful gains, and SoFi is demonstrating it can diversify beyond this segment.\n\nSoFi may continue to stay flat for months, but once it gains momentum, it can take off quickly.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SEZL, ELF, and SOFI.

        "content": "As I\u2019ve noted in a few past columns, \u201cInvestor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019s IBD 50 is \u2018a weekly, rules-based, computer-generated stock index.\u2019\u201d Moreover, the stocks on the list tend to be fundamentally strong and have top-notch growth outlooks. Also importantly, their shares are usually being rapidly acquired by a significant portion of Wall Street\u2019s largest investors.\n\nI\u2019ve used the IBD top 50 stocks list on multiple occasions as a screening tool to identify little-known names that eventually turned out to be big winners. Also illustrating the excellent performance of the list, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (NYSEARCA: FFTY) has jumped about 20% so far in 2024. Of course, the ETF seeks to reflect the performance of all of the companies on the list. Here are three of the top stocks to buy that are currently on the IBD top 50 list.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which sells cosmetics products, is well-positioned to benefit from an important macro trend. Specifically, as I pointed out in a recent column, a survey conducted last month by well-known consulting firm McKinsey found that the members of Generation Z intend to spend more money on beauty products going forward. And 29% of all respondents reported that they intend to \u201csplurge\u201d on beauty and personal care products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\ne.l.f. is likely already benefiting from this key trend. It reported outstanding first-quarter financial results with net sales soaring 71% versus the same period a year earlier to $321 million. Further, adjusted EBITDA soared 93% year-over-year to $40.9 million.\n\nOn June 18, investment bank Canaccord Genuity hiked its price target on ELF stock to $250 from $214. According to the bank, the sales of the company\u2019s products by its channel partners have been doubling year-over-year, while e.l.f. should benefit from improvements in the shelf positioning of its products this summer.\n\nIBD gives ELF stock an Accumulation/Distribution grade of A-. That means that many large institutional investors have been buying the shares over the last 13 weeks.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screen\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix\u2019s (NASDAQ:NFLX) active user base, revenues and profits are increasing rapidly, largely thanks to its new, more affordable ad-supported plan and its efforts to prevent password sharing. The number of users of its ad tier soared to 40 million at the end of last quarter, versus just 5 million during the same period a year earlier. The company estimates that over 500 million people worldwide watch its channel.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, the company\u2019s user base jumped nearly 13%, while its operating income soared 54% year-over-year to $2.6 billion year-over-year in Q1 and its revenue rose 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $9.37 billion.\n\nOver the longer term, Netflix should get a big boost from its addition of live programming, including sports. This change should enable it to meaningfully raise its prices, boosting its top and bottom lines.\r\n\r\nIn the shorter term, the company should get a lift from increased viewership of its ads.\n\nRoyal Caribbean (RCL) Serenade of the Seas cruise\n\nSource: NAN728 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I noted in a past column, consumer confidence recently dropped to its lowest level since the end of 2023, according to data collected by McKinsey. However, 33% of consumers still want to \u201csplurge\u201d on travel, McKinsey found.\n\nThat dynamic should boost Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) and its peers, since cruises provide consumers with relatively affordable vacations.\n\nRoyal Caribbean may already have been significantly helped by this dynamic as its top line jumped 29% versus the same period a year earlier in Q1 to $3.7 billion, while its bottom line came in at $360 million up from a loss of $48 million in Q1 of 2022. The company expects its profit to jump 60% for the full year.\n\nIn May, Wells Fargo predicted that the U.S. cruise sector would have a good year, driven by new ships and strong booking trends. Given these points, I view RCL stock as one of the top stocks to buy at this point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "content": "Silent stocks will do a lot of the heavy lifting for portfolios in the background. Of course, these companies aren\u2019t the ones making headlines every day like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). However, silent companies are the ones that quietly compound over the years. These will help grow your portfolio in the long term. In other words, these stocks can help amass fortunes for investors without having to ever lift a finger.\n\nSo what constitutes a silent stock? Often these stocks do not get the same coverage as other more high-profile companies. They can be in industries that are not as sexy as things like AI or electric vehicles. Or they can be lesser-known companies that aren\u2019t always considered the leaders in their particular sectors. In this article, we chose three silent stocks that have provided excellent returns to shareholders so far this year. These three can quietly amass fortunes for investors over the next decade or more!\n\nArm Holdings plc (ARM) ARM company logo or ARM Holding plc logo on smartphone hardware. is a British semiconductor and software design company owned by SoftBank group\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nArm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor company that provides chips and CPUs for AI. While this company may be in a trending industry, it has largely been left in the shadow of its older siblings. These include NVIDIA and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). ARM is a relatively new stock to the markets. Its one-yearanalyst price range starts at $55.95. It goes as high as $189.00, which implies a 20% upside from today\u2019s price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhat makes Arm a special chip company? It is the leading provider of IP solutions for a wide range of different types of chips. These include CPUs, GPUs and NPUs. Arm\u2019s chips and its technology are more energy-efficient and low-cost than its peers. They are also used by companies worldwide to develop advanced technologies. Arm-designed chips are used to power most smartphones including Apple\u2019s iPhones.\u00a0As a testament to this companies fast growth, ARM is set to join the NASDAQ-100 index by mid June!\n\nWhile Arm\u2019s stock trades at a somewhat high premium, when compared to its industry forward earnings median, Arm trades at a lower multiple than peers like Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). For now, let these other companies keep the headlines, and allow Arm to silently amass a fortune for you in the shadows of the other chip giants.\n\nFreeport-McMoran (FCX) Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy Status\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nLooking for another way to play the AI race without buying expensive chip stocks? Look no further than Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX),one of the largest copper miners in the world, and a leading supplier of raw materials for such AI chip manufacturing. Currently, FCX has an average price target of $50.84 and a high-end target of $55.96, implying a near 15% upside for the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile commodity-based companies may seem boring, copper will be one of the raw materials in high demand in the coming years. We\u2019ve already seen the metal hit fresh all-time highs last month on the excitement of rapidly accelerating data center demand. After all, copper is a vital component of semiconductors and wiring that is used to connect data centers worldwide. Just this past year, this silent stock has already returned more than 14% to shareholders this year while paying a modest dividend yield of 0.62%.\n\nEven after gaining 14% this year, this stock is still sitting modestly below its sector median EV/EBIT ratio by around 12%. Any investor looking to jump on AI\u2019s demand fueled trend in a more diversified way should look at FCX as a candidate amassing long-term fortune.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF)  an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is another stock that has been silently outperforming the markets this year. Wall Street analysts have an average price target of $208.08 and a high-end price target of $235.00 for ELF which implies a 25% upside from the stock\u2019s current price.\n\nThis beauty and cosmetics company just posted 77% year-over-year growth in net sales for the fiscal year 2024. It was the fifth consecutive year of sales growth for the company and has slowly but surely taken market share from larger brands. A key competitive moat for this company has been its success in promoting its product across social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest and Tik Tok, which has allowed it to strengthen brand loyalty amongst younger shoppers.\n\nAfter its rally this year, this stock\u2019s earnings and sales ratio are a bit pricier than its five-year average. Thankfully, when looking at its PEG to account for growth, ELF is only barely sitting above its sector median. While this is currently justified by its stellar growth as of recent, this company can be a sure bet in the cosmetic industry as a silent compounder to add to any diversified portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Why Are e.l.f. (ELF) Shares Soaring Today",
        "content": "Why Are e.l.f. (ELF) Shares Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) jumped 6.7% in the afternoon session after major indices soared as yields declined after the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported CPI (Consumer Price Index - a gauge of the average price consumers pay for goods and services) for the month of May 2024 came in better than expected at 3.3% year on year (versus analysts' expectations for 3.4%). The data also revealed that inflation was flat (unchanged) month on month. The inflation results benefitted from a 2% decline in the energy index, while shelter inflation remained sticky (up 0.4% m/m and 5.4% y/y). Sticky inflation is exactly what has delayed the Fed's planned rate cuts in 2024, with some market participants likely worried that inflation might stay higher for longer. Today's report eased those worries a bit.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Open Market Committee kept interest rates at 5.25% to 5.50% following its June 2024 monetary policy meeting while also projecting no more than one rate cut in the second half of the year. The committee noted in its post-meeting statement that, \"In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.\"\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nIs now the time to buy e.l.f.? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\ne.l.f.'s shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 28 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago, when the company gained 22% on the news that the company reported first-quarter earnings results. e.l.f. blew past analysts' EPS expectations. Its revenue (up 71% y/y) also outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by higher unit volumes and mix. In FY'24, the company surpassed the milestone of $1B in annual sales. On the other hand, its operating margin missed analysts' expectations, and its full-year revenue and earnings guidance missed Wall Street's estimates. The company provided conservative guidance partly due to concerns about macro uncertainty, with the FY'25 sales forecast pointing to a significant growth deceleration and implying 21.1% growth (vs. 77.2% in FY2024). Overall, this was a mixed yet decent quarter for e.l.f.\n\nStory continues\n\ne.l.f. is up 42.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $200.09 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $217.40 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of e.l.f.'s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,466.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Let's talk about the popular e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. While good news for shareholders, the company has traded much higher in the past year. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today we will analyse the most recent data on e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nSee our latest analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In e.l.f. Beauty?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 12% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy e.l.f. Beauty today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $214.81, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\n\nWhat does the future of e.l.f. Beauty look like? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. e.l.f. Beauty's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 90%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? ELF\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on ELF, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that e.l.f. Beauty has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in e.l.f.

        "content": "In this article, we will talk about the Best Date Night Fragrance in 2024. For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 20 Best Date Night Fragrances in 2024.\n\nThe Booming Luxury Fragrance Market and Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) Strategic Expansion:\n\nAs the luxury and ultraluxury beauty products market is expected to grow from $20 billion to $40 billion by 2027, according to McKinsey, the fragrance and cosmetics behemoth, Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY), doesn't want to ignore this sector.\n\nThe company recently launched a new line of premium scents under its luxury brand Infiniment Coty Paris, and the project was presented as Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY)\u2019s \"most ambitious and most premium fragrance project to date.\" As per the company, the collection will eventually consist of fourteen different perfumes.\n\nRegarding this new venture, the CEO of Coty, Sue Nabi, stated, \"Infiniment Coty Paris is a creation that marks a natural progression for the company, fusing beauty, science, and art.\u201d\n\nDue to the strength of current icons and the contribution of new releases, Coty\u2019s prestige fragrance revenues increased by about 7%, as reported, 12% LFL in Q3 2024, and by roughly 18% year-to-date. The business stated that Burberry Goddess, Coty's biggest launch ever, remains a top worldwide female fragrance launch, which, together with robust growth in other Burberry brands, delivered an upsurge of over 50% in Burberry's overall net revenues in Q3 2024.\n\nOverall, the global perfume market, as previously mentioned in our article titled \"15 Best Everyday Colognes in 2024,\" was valued at $50.85 billion in 2022 and is predicted to boost at a CAGR of 5.9% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nRecent Developments in the Beauty Industry:\n\nOne of the \u201cBiggest Skincare Companies In The US\u201d and \u201c15 Best Beauty Stocks To Invest In,\u201d e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF), has released its financial statistics for the final quarter and the full fiscal year 2024. According to the mass market makeup company, net sales in the year ending March 31, 2024, increased by an incredible 77% to $1,023.9 million over the same time the previous year, breaking the billion barrier.\n\nSales increased in the fiscal year 2024, predominantly due to the strength of the e-commerce and retail channels, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) stated. Moreover, the gross margin rose by almost 330 basis points to 71% as a result of favorable foreign currency impacts, cost reductions, and mix.\n\nLooking forward, the business estimates that its fiscal 2025 sales will be between $1,230 million to $1,250 million, representing a 20-22% growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nTarang Amin, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)\u2019s Chairman and CEO, remarked enthusiastically:\n\n\u201cFiscal 2024 marked our strongest year of net sales growth on record, a continuation of the exceptional, consistent, category-leading growth we\u2019ve delivered. In Q4, we grew net sales by 71 percent and expanded our market share by 325 basis points, marking our 21st consecutive quarter of net sales and market share growth. As we look ahead, we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for Elf Beauty across cosmetics, skin care and international markets.\u201d\n\nSecondly, a collection of seven scents has been recently unveiled by the Italian fashion house Fendi. Although the LVMH-owned Fendi brand has previously sold perfumes at wholesale retail, this is the first time the brand will be offered for sale at its stores.\n\nThe seven-piece collection has fragrances like La Baguette, named for the renowned Fendi bag, which has notes of iris and vanilla, and Perch\u00e9 No, which has notes of sandalwood and pink pepper.\n\nOn a side note, LVMH had a significant annual revenue of $93.57 billion in 2023.\n\nWith that said, is the Best Date Night Fragrance in 2024.\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo pick out the Best Date Night Fragrance in 2024, we searched the internet for the best date night fragrances and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores. We have also included each perfume\u2019s price and quantity in our list, using the price as a tie-breaker in case two or more perfumes had the same score. The prices that we have mentioned are for particular spray bottles with varying capacities, mostly relying on Sephora, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s, and Saks Fifth Avenue for the data. Please note, however, that we can\u2019t guarantee the accuracy of these prices, since they can vary from region to region.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this cosmetics company have returned +7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Cosmetics industry, to which e.l.f. Beauty belongs, has lost 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -25.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has changed -4.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.30 indicates a change of +25.8% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, e.l.f. Beauty is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ELF _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of e.l.f. Beauty, the consensus sales estimate of $299.84 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +38.6%. The $1.28 billion and $1.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +25.5% and +18.4%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenues of $321.14 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +71.4%. EPS of $0.53 for the same period compares with $0.42 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.47 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.81%. The EPS surprise was +51.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about e.l.f. Beauty. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "You don\u2019t have to buy speculative stocks to triple your money in a few years.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s even easier to triple your money if you set a lengthy time horizon. A slow and steady approach can yield better results than a high-risk, high-reward portfolio.\n\nBlue-chip stocks with immense potential tend to have a few things in common. These companies have rising revenue and profit margins. They also have tremendous long-term growth opportunities and strong demand for their offers. These three blue-chip stocks seem to fit the bill and have the potential to generate meaningful gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteakhouse chain Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) has 753 restaurants and uses a mix of its own restaurants and franchises. It has 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise restaurants. Company-owned restaurants grew by 5.4% year-over-year (YOY) while the total number of franchise restaurants was up by 17.2% YOY.\n\nCurrently, the corporation has an $11.5 billion market cap and a 35 P/E ratio. That valuation is more reasonable than most restaurant chains that are growing at similar rates as Texas Roadhouse. Also, the stock has a 1.41% yield along with an\u00a0annualized dividend growth rate of 16.05% over the past decade.\n\nTexas Roadhouse reported 12.5% YOY revenue growth and 31.0% YOY net income growth in Q1 of 2024. More investors are loading up on restaurants with compelling growth prospects.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit shocking that Texas Roadhouse hasn\u2019t soared higher based on the current demand for these stocks. However, it\u2019s to the benefit of investors who spot this under-the-radar pick. The hidden gem has held its own compared to most indices. Shares are up by 45% YTD and have gained 211% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) isn\u2019t exactly a hidden gem. The tech giant is a trillion-dollar corporation that captures headlines as a member of the Magnificent Seven. However, this blue-chip stock still has the potential to triple its returns over the next decade.\n\nInvestors may feel as if a 35% year-to-date (YTD) gain and a 5-year gain of 170% make Meta Platforms due for a correction. However, the company\u2019s financials support those returns. Net income more than doubled YOY in Q1 of 2024 as the social media giant aims to become more efficient. Revenue increased by 27% YOY, indicating that the company can trim its headcount while gaining market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost all of the company\u2019s revenue comes from advertising. While Meta Platforms\u2019 strides in artificial intelligence (AI) can lead to new income streams, investors have to treat it primarily as an ad company rather than a tech conglomerate.\n\nEven though advertising is the company\u2019s make-or-break source of revenue, it\u2019s a compelling pick for patient investors. Meta Platforms does very well in that department, and users continue to flock to the company\u2019s social networks. Family daily active users reached 3.24 billion\u00a0which\u00a0is a 7% YOY improvement.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nBeauty company Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) continues to exceed investors\u2019 expectations while delivering impressive returns. The company is pricier than the others on this list with its 85 P/E ratio. Elf Beauty has the high valuation because investors have been rushing to buy shares. The stock is up by 34% YTD and has gained a superb 1,470% over the past five years.\n\nAlso, the cosmetics firm delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales growth in Q4 of 2024. Revenue increased by 71% YOY in the quarter and resulted in the company\u2019s first year of more than $1 billion in net sales. Also, the firm gained market share in the beauty industry for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nWhile its guidance initially spooked investors, Elf Beauty issued low guidance last year and proceeded to comfortably beat its guidance each quarter. The company has a vast opportunity as it taps into international markets. Leadership believes that it is still in its early innings of capitalizing on that opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in TXRH and ELF.

        "content": "Despite the shared spotlight with advances in artificial intelligence, metaverse stocks to buy still attract big-time investment opportunities.\n\nThe metaverse continues to be a symbol of cutting-edge technology and an ideal market for investment. While tech giants work on building this digital world, it\u2019s a great time to bet on metaverse stocks.\n\nConsidering that the development of this idea will take at least a decade, those who enter early could see a significant bump in the expansion of this concept, as it becomes more popular.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, forecasts suggest a stellar growth rate of more than 30 percent per year up to 2033. This puts the metaverse among the most rapidly developing industries, which is why giants like HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) have launched a special fund to invest in this future landscape.\n\nTherefore, these three metaverse stocks are an excellent investment opportunity for anyone interested in investing in the next big thing.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) consistently emerges as a top choice when exploring metaverse stocks to buy. Ranked as the seventh-largest global company, Meta actively drives technological progress. This prominent position, along with its stock price soaring 82% over the past year, emphasizes Meta\u2019s crucial role in determining the future of the metaverse.\n\nMeta has lost more than $45 billion in Reality Labs since the end of 2020. Yet, it remains a lucrative niche for investment under the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, although at a slower pace now.\n\nAdditionally, the company plans to shift from the Workplace app to metaverse technology to create more innovations like the Oculus AR and VR goggles and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. This dedication could potentially result in further advancements.\n\nLastly, Meta is in a robust financial position. It generated a whopping $12.53 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter, which proves that it makes good money. Revenue skyrocketed by 27% year-over-year to $36.46 billion, and net income more than doubled in the same period. Thus, Meta has the financial muscle to fund the metaverse vision.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is changing how people experience virtual reality with its haptic solutions, providing feedback that improves user metaverse experiences.\n\nSubsequently, Immersion strengthened its market position by substantial license arrangements in 2024. A February agreement with Meta Platforms allowed the use of Immersion\u2019s patents for a broad range of products, underlining the increasing importance of haptics in VR.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in March, the company renewed its agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), thus ensuring that its technology is relevant in the gaming industry.\n\nFurthermore, Immersion returned $15.7 million to shareholders in 2023. The company\u2019s CEO, Eric Singer, credited this accomplishment to prudent financial allocation, renewable licensing and hard work in intellectual property protection.\n\nThese strategic measures led to an excellent Q1 for Immersion. Its revenues surged to $43.8 million, a 520% upswing YOY, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by 18.91 million. Net income rose to $18.7 million, compared to $8.3 million a year ago. Additionally, Immersion\u2019s debt-free status and solid cash reserves position it well to seize enticing growth opportunities.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to most social media platforms, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is eager to keep its young audience engaged, given that it has been in the metaverse business for quite some time now. To further this ambition, Roblox is opening up video ads on virtual billboards of such brands as e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). These ads would monetize Roblox\u2019s user base and significantly pump revenue streams.\n\nWhile Roblox\u2019s stock dropped after the Q2 guidance, the company reported strong Q1 numbers. Its revenues were up 22% YOY, totaling $801.3 million, and average daily active users increased by 17%, reaching an astonishing 77.7 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Roblox has big plans for its platform and developer support. This includes the Immersion Mode, superior haptic controls, enhanced avatars and an upgraded marketplace. These improvements are intended to escalate user engagement, thus positioning Roblox to capture additional market share as the metaverse expands.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Does it make sense to buy stocks that have already delivered incredible gains? That's an important question investors are always thinking about. Is it too late to buy, or is there more coming?\n\nAn example is e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF) stock, which is up 75% over the past year, and is seriously outperforming the market. It's demonstrating tremendous resilience despite the inflationary environment, and it looks like there's plenty of gas left in its tank. If you buy shares today, I think you can expect them to double and go even higher.\n\nThe new standard in cosmetics\n\ne.l.f. is the modern response to age-old beauty needs. It brands itself as disruptive, positive, and inclusive, \"with heart.\" In other words, it's what resonates with today's millennial and Gen Z consumers. It also prices itself to meet mass demand. Altogether, it has built a formidable and distinctive cosmetics empire that's just getting started.\n\nMany beauty companies are reporting pressure and declines. e.l.f. continues to skyrocket. In the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended March 31), sales soared 71% over last year, with strong growth in both the wholesale business and e-commerce channels. Even more, sales growth has been accelerating over the past two years, while almost every similar company is slowing or reporting decreasing sales. e.l.f. has an edge with its lower prices, which attract more spend when shoppers have lower budgets but need their beauty fix.\n\nGross margin expanded to 71% in the first quarter, driven by a mix of drivers such as lower transportation costs and currency fluctuations in its favor. There was a decline in net income from $16.2 million last year to $14.5 million this year, but adjusted net income, which excludes costs related to its recent acquisition of skincare company Naturium, was $30.8 million.\n\nManagement is expecting sales growth to decelerate next year, guiding for a 21% sales increase in 2025, and a similar increase in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It's expecting a slight increase in adjusted net income.\n\nThe future looks beautiful\n\nIf you invest now, you're investing in e.l.f.'s potential to keep up its strong performance. There are many reasons to be confident about the future, even if it may begin to experience some inflationary pressure in the near term.\n\nLow prices is one way e.l.f. is generating high demand. It's significantly cheaper than the competition, with an average product price of $6.50 versus $9.50 for similar brands, and other drugstore brands are losing market share while e.l.f. has been gaining.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's also making a big push to find customers on the channels where they're hanging out. The company creates videos with product drops and posts them on sites like TikTok, with product drops selling out within minutes.\n\ne.l.f.'s positive, on-target messaging helps it stand out from the competition, and it's developing strong relationships with loyal fans. It's the No. 5 cosmetics brand in market share with 6.6%, and it sees a significant opportunity to increase that. Management is heavily investing in disruptive and innovative marketing that its customers love, which sets it apart, and it's increased its marketing spend from 7% of sales to 25%.\n\nOne area with major upside is skincare. Overall skincare industry consumption increased 2% in the first quarter, while e.l.f. skincare sales increased 38%. However, it's still only ranked No. 11, and this is an area where it can grow and capture market share.\n\nInternational is another strong growth driver. International sales increased 115% year over year in the fourth quarter, and e.l.f. is just getting started in global sales, with only 16% global penetration\n\nFinally, it has a strong pipeline of new brands and products that give it a wide-open runway, such as the recent Naturium acquisition.\n\nLow-priced products, but a high-priced stock\n\nInvestors may appreciate how e.l.f. is building a thriving business on low prices, but they aren't thrilled with e.l.f. stock's price right now. e.l.f. stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 82, the standard valuation metric, and it's expensive by most valuation ratios.\n\ne.l.f.stock gets a premium for its incredible growth and steady profits. There's the possibility that some of that is already built into such a high price, but there's so much more coming. Wall Street sees a modest 12% gain over the next 12 to 18 months, but e.l.f. should reward patient long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in e.l.f. Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in e.l.f. Beauty, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and e.l.f. Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "You rarely read about CEO pay cuts.\u00a0According to Barron\u2019s April report, the CEOs of the top 100 companies by revenue in America made an average of $23.7 million in 2023, 11.4% higher than in 2022.\n\n\u201c\u2018Will the trend of outsize salary increases for CEOs continue into the future? It can\u2019t forever,\u2019 says Jonas Johnson, vice president of research at compensation consulting firm Economic Research Institute. \u2018Twenty, thirty years of 8% gains, you\u2019re looking at double in compensation every seven years, and that can only go on for so long. At some point the numbers become unsustainable,\u2019\u201d Barron\u2019s wrote on April 19.\n\nBased on Johnson\u2019s comments, if you become CEO today at $23.7 million in 2034, you can expect to earn nearly $50 million as top dog at some of America\u2019s largest companies. That\u2019s significantly more than most American workers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne CEO who took a pay cut in 2023 was Kroger (NYSE:KR) boss Rodney McMullen. McMullen was forced to live with total compensation 18% less than a year earlier at $15.5 million, below the average of the top 100, and just 502x more than the median pay of the average worker at his grocery store chain.\n\nAll the CEOs need to take pay cuts. Let\u2019s start with these three.\n\nSue Nabi, Coty (COTY) The Coty (COTY) logo on a glass office in Poland.\n\nSource: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nI didn\u2019t get too philosophical in my selections this time around. Instead, I took the top three CEOs from The Equilar 100 who had the highest CEO pay ratios, defined as the \u201cThe ratio of the CEO\u2019s total compensation to the median employee\u2019s total compensation,\u201d according to Coty\u2019s (NYSE:COTY) 2023 proxy.\n\nIn 2023, CEO Sue Nabi\u2019s total compensation was $149.4 million, 98% of which was in stock awards. This was 3,769x the median employee\u2019s total compensation, and it was $436.8 million in the past three years.\n\nSince Nabi was hired as CEO in September 2020, Coty\u2019s share price has appreciated by roughly 167%. However, in the same 44 months, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s (NYSE:ELF) shares are up 874%, now more valuable than COTY.\n\nIts CEO, Tarang Amin, earned $16.31 million over three years, less than 4% of Nabi\u2019s pay. Amin\u2019s pay was a reasonable 46x the median employee\u2019s total compensation.\n\nI\u2019ve learned two things: Coty\u2019s CEO is way overpaid, and e.l.f Beauty\u2019s is way underpaid.\n\nJames Quincey, Coca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to Equilar, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) CEO James Quincey\u2019s total compensation in 2023 was $23.8 million, but the beverage company\u2019s proxy says $24.7 million, 63% of that in stock and option awards. His total compensation was 1,799x the median employee\u2019s total compensation. Quincey\u2019s total compensation was $72.4 million in the past three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nQuincey has been Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO since May 2017. He\u2019s been with the company since 1996, when he was promoted to the top job from COO. Since he\u2019s been CEO, KO stock has appreciated by just about 37%, while the S&P 500 has appreciated by 123%.\n\nWarren Buffett might want to suggest that Coke hire a new CEO. When Quincey took over, Coca-Cola was Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) second-largest equity holding, valued at $17.2 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016. Today, it\u2019s the fourth-largest, at $24.7 billion.\n\nYes, I get that Buffett likes dividend income, but the last time I checked, total return dividends plus capital appreciation were also available.\n\nFor the company\u2019s size, you might be able to argue that he\u2019s appropriately paid. However, the lack of performance from its stock suggests a change at the top could be in order.\n\nChristopher Winfrey, Charter Communications (CHTR) The Charter Communications (CHTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2023, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) CEO Christopher Winfrey had a total compensation of $89.1 million, 94% of that in stock and option awards. His total compensation was 1,635x the median employee\u2019s total compensation. Winfrey\u2019s total compensation was $116.4 million in the past three years.\n\nWinfrey was hired as CEO in December 2022. Before that, he was the cable company\u2019s COO and CFO, joining the firm in 2010. He has been in the top job for 17 months, so assessing his performance so far wouldn\u2019t be fair. That said, its shares have lost about 27% of their value with Winfrey in command.\n\nGiven the current share price of about $287, approximately 592,395 options are in the money and are yet to be exercised. The largest being 497,309, which expires on June 17, 2026. These were granted long before he became CEO. He\u2019d be sitting on a $25 million profit if he exercised those today. The other 95,000 are even more in the money.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to say how overpaid he is as CEO, the pay ratio is obscene.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

        "content": "Many investors know about the Magnificent Seven stocks. If you haven\u2019t heard of that phrase before, you will still recognize the stocks within that cohort. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, ranked by current market cap.\n\nMost ETFs have large positions in these stocks, especially the ones that track broader indices. However, some growth gems aren\u2019t as obvious. These picks are relatively overlooked but look ready to outperform most, if not all, of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the years ahead.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) recently reported its 21st consecutive quarter of sales growth. The company also gained market share in the beauty industry for the 5th consecutive year while delivering more than $1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company ended on a strong note with 71% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Investors initially got spooked by this report, since e.l.f. Beauty offered modest guidance that called for a 20% to 22% YOY net sales increase in fiscal 2025.\n\nWhile this represents a meaningful drop, e.l.f. Beauty has always been conservative in its guidance. The company raised its guidance multiple times in fiscal 2024 and initially projected similar results for that year. Instead of seeing revenue growth in the mid-twenties, investors got to enjoy 77% YOY net sales growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares are up 29% year-to-date and have surged nearly 1,700% over the past five years. The stock currently has a $10.2 billion market cap and may be added to the S&P 500 within 1 to 3 years.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d platform that trades at a 34 P/E ratio and has a market cap of $460 million. Most people haven\u2019t heard of this stock, yet it has more than tripled year-to-date. The P/E ratio combined with strong financials have made the rally sustainable.\n\nRevenue increased by 35.5% YOY in Q1 2024. GAAP net income was up by an astonishing 364% YOY. The company\u2019s total subscribers surged from 142,000 members in Q1 2023 to 371,000 members in Q1 2024. Sezzle also reported a 45.9% YOY increase in the number of transactions, demonstrating more frequent purchases from its members.\n\nSezzle isn\u2019t receiving as much attention as other investors. Analysts aren\u2019t rushing to assign price targets for this up-and-coming fintech firm. More than half of the company\u2019s shares are currently owned by insiders. Leadership has a lot of skin in the game, which is good to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi (SOFI) An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is another fintech firm worth monitoring. The stock has been on a roller coaster, which includes a 28% year-to-date decline, but the stock\u2019s recent results don\u2019t match up with the company\u2019s earnings report.\n\nWhile the stock\u2019s recent price movement may have investors think otherwise, SoFi reported solid results. Revenue increased by 37% YOY in the first quarter of 2024. Net income was also solid. The company went from a GAAP loss of $44.4 million in Q1 2023 to $77.9 million GAAP profitability this quarter.\n\nSoFi offers many financial products that should keep retention high. It has loans, brokerage accounts, bank accounts, credit cards and other resources. SoFi can also offer more competitive rates since it is a digital bank with less overhead than traditional banks.\n\nLeadership\u2019s multi-year plan suggests earnings and revenue should continue to march higher. The stock price should go up along with the company\u2019s financials.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, SEZL and SOFI.

Beauty (NYSE: ELF), known as a bold disruptor with a kind heart, is expanding its partnership with three-time world champion para swimmer Anastasia \"Tas\" Pagonis as she defends her world record and pursues more gold medals in swimming throughout the 2024 competition season.\n\ne.l.f. and Pagonis, who has been legally blind since she was 14, are on a journey together to make the beauty industry more accessible for members of the community with limited or no-vision. Pagonis previously was featured in e.l.f.\u2019s \"Show Your(s)e.l.f.\" documentary featuring inspirational stories from incredible role models who see beauty in the entirety of the human experience, from adversity to triumph \u2013 with positivity, inclusivity and accessibility.\n\nNew, candid content will give a behind-the-scenes look at Pagonis\u2019s world and how she feels preparing and positioning herself to win more events on the global stage later this summer.

She encourages us all to live our bold truth and inspires us to express our truest selves.\"\n\nA gold medalist and world record holding para swimmer who set multiple records in 2020, Pagonis lost her vision gradually due to a degenerative autoimmune disease. She turned to social media to help herself cope with life\u2019s challenges, talking about her journey, her approach to beauty and the road to becoming a competitive athlete. One thing she learned from her community is that she could be an inspiration to others who face adversity as a role model who can empower others.\n\n\"Working with e.l.f. has been a dream come true. I am so e.l.f.ing excited to be part of the family, and they want to tell my story in an authentic way, sharing the ups and downs,\" said Pagonis. \"They love me for me, and they let me be me, which makes this such a great partnership.\"\n\nAbout e.l.f.

        "content": "At first glance, sustainable stocks to buy sounds like a nice concept but that ultimately won\u2019t make you money. If we look at capitalism in the most cynical sense, the ethos strives to maximize profitability while minimizing costs. And it costs money to be sustainable.\n\nHowever, that may be a poor way of framing the topic. Yes, cutting corners in practices and ethics can yield greater revenue and profitability. However, that\u2019s in the short term. Over the long run, unsustainable practices are, well, unsustainable. Stated differently, going about business in a shady way merely delays inevitable ruin.\n\nPlus, the emerging generation of consumers care deeply about holistic practices. Ignoring this trend can be detrimental to the bottom line. On that note, below are sustainable stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nKellanova (K) a delivery man in a red shirt dropping off a bag of groceries to represent food and beverage stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Chicago, Illinois, Kellanova (NYSE:K) falls under the consumer defensive category, specifically packaged goods. Along with its subsidiaries, Kellanova manufactures and markets snacks and convenience foods. As it relates to sustainable stocks to buy, the company features its MorningStar Farms brand, which focuses on plant-based meat.\n\nOn the plus side, Kellanova is financially consistent. Between the second quarter of 2023 to Q1 2024, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 15.23%. However, the not-so-pleasant side is that analysts anticipate a top-line erosion. For fiscal 2024, revenue may drop down to $12.67 billion, 3.5% below last year\u2019s print of $13.12 billion.\n\nAssuming a shares outstanding count of 341.88 million, K stock is currently trading at roughly 1.61X projected revenue. That\u2019s a bit hot compared to the 1.5X average over the past five quarters. However, if shares fall down to around $50, the sales multiple would reach approximately 1.35X. That would be a more comfortable entry point. Judging by recent volatility, that price point is a real possibility.\n\nBloom Energy (BE) BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nHeadquartered in San Jose, California, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) works in the industrial segment, specifically in electrical equipment and parts. Per its public profile, Bloom designs, manufactures, sells and installs solid-oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation in the U.S. and international markets. BE ranks among the sustainable stocks to buy because it converts fuels such as natural gas into electricity without combustion.\n\nFinancially, the company is admittedly hit or miss. Yes, technically speaking, its average quarterly surprise comes out to 92.7%. However, Bloom badly missed the mark in Q2 and Q4 last year and Q1 this year. However, in Q3, it posted earnings per share of 15 cents when experts anticipated a loss of 4 cents.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the trailing 12 months (TTM), Bloom incurred a net loss of $288.07 million on revenue of $1.29 billion. However, for fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to hit 10 cents, a big improvement over last year\u2019s loss of 10 cents. Revenue could also expand 9.8% to hit $1.46 billion.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to sustainable stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) needs no introduction to those in the know. However, to recap for everyone, the company falls under the regulated electric utilities space. Per its corporate profile, NextEra generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric power to retail and wholesale customers in North America. It features a vast portfolio, including wind, solar and battery storage projects.\n\nFinancially, the benefit of owning NEE stock centers on the underlying consistency. Between Q2 2023 to Q1 2024, NextEra\u2019s average positive earnings surprise comes out to 9.53%. Over the TTM period, the company generated net income of $7.49 billion on sales of $27.13 billion. This print enables the utility to deliver a forward dividend yield of 2.69%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts anticipate that EPS will hit $3.40. That\u2019s a decent improvement from last year\u2019s result of $3.17. However, the consensus revenue target calls for $27.39 billion, which represents a 2.6% decline. Still, the high-side target is aiming for $32.68 billion, which could be realistic given the broader interest in sustainability.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a software and technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction, period. Chances are, you\u2019re using one of its business software to execute various functions. Or you could be playing video games via its popular Xbox console. However, MSFT is also one of the sustainable stocks to buy thanks to its core ethos. Microsoft broadcasted aggressive sustainability targets, including being carbon negative by 2030.\n\nOf course, the added bonus for owning MSFT beyond the holistic angle is the robust financial performance. In the past four quarters, the company\u2019s average positive earnings surprise came out to 7%. During the TTM period, net income clocked in at $86.18 billion on revenue of $236.58 billion. Presently, the company\u2019s quarterly revenue growth (year-over-year) stands at 17%.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, analysts forecast EPS to hit $11.79. That\u2019s a massive leap forward from last year\u2019s print of $9.81. On the top line, Microsoft could reach $244.92 billion. If so, that would represent a 15.6% gain from 2023\u2019s tally of $211.91 billion.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt first glance, putting legacy automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) in a list of sustainable stocks to buy seems odd. After all, the sector has been responsible for a large portion of carbon emissions. However, GM is taking a major step forward in being environmentally responsible. In addition to its pivot to new-generation vehicles, it\u2019s targeting the elimination of tailpipe emissions (from new light-duty vehicles) by 2035.\n\nIn addition, the company aims to be carbon-neutral in its products and operations by 2040. Financially, the focus on holistic efforts hasn\u2019t impeded its progress. In the past four quarters since Q1, GM\u2019s average quarterly earnings surprise clocked in at just under 14%. Over the TTM period, the automaker posted a net income of $10.62 billion on sales of $174.87 billion.\n\nLooking out to the end of fiscal 2024, analysts anticipate EPS to expand by 24.6% to hit $9.57. On the top line, sales could land at $175.98 billion, a modest increase from last year\u2019s $171.84 billion. The company also offers a forward dividend yield of 1.09%, helping to pad the narrative.\n\nelf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile a cosmetics enterprise might not be the first idea for sustainable stocks to buy, elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) aims to change perceptions. Together with its subsidiaries, elf is mainly known for its mineral-based makeup and professional tools. Fundamentally, the business has resonated with its core young consumers thanks to its focus on cruelty-free products.\n\nWith consumers increasingly voting their conscience with their wallets, elf is making a smart move. As its recent earnings report demonstrated, the prioritization in sustainability hasn\u2019t hurt the business. In fact, it\u2019s probably helped. Over the past four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise came out to nearly 63%. In the TTM period, net income reached $127.66 million on sales of $1.02 billion.\n\nFor fiscal 2025, covering experts are seeking EPS of $3.41, a 7.2% increase from last year\u2019s print of $3.18. On the top line, sales could reach $1.28 billion, up 25% from fiscal 2024. Although ELF stock trades at a hot premium of 10.8X, it\u2019s trading at 8.44X forward revenue. Stated differently, it could grow into its valuation.\n\nEnphase Energy (ENPH) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nA relevant idea for sustainable stocks to buy, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) is also one of the riskiest. Over the past 52 weeks, ENPH lost almost 26% of equity value. Since the start of the year, shares are underwater by more than 1%. That\u2019s very disappointing but the issue is that the solar technology specialist is struggling amid broader economic concerns.\n\nAnalysts are overall bullish on ENPH stock, rating it a consensus moderate buy. That\u2019s great but the problem is that the average price target sits at $125, implying more than 3% downside risk. On the plus side, the most optimistic target calls for $165 per share. It\u2019s a mixed bag financially. While the average quarterly surprise is 1.63%, Enphase missed its bottom-line target in Q4 and Q1.\n\nThe ambiguity is reflected in the forecast for the current fiscal year. Analysts anticipate EPS to drop to $2.85, down 35.3% from last year. Also, revenue might only reach $1.47 billion, down almost 36%. However, the blue-sky sales target stands at $1.54 billion. And next year, the high-side view runs up to sales of $2.55 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk but speculators should keep it on their radar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cosmetics company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Cosmetics industry, which e.l.f. Beauty falls in, has lost 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $1.10 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.9%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $3.49 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.34 indicates a change of +24.5% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ELF _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of e.l.f. Beauty, the consensus sales estimate of $297.92 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +37.7%. The $1.28 billion and $1.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +25.4% and +17.7%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenues of $321.14 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +71.4%. EPS of $0.53 for the same period compares with $0.42 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $292.47 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.81%. The EPS surprise was +51.43%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about e.l.f. Beauty. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The stock market provides ample ways to grow wealth. Dividends and value investing are common methods. But growth stocks can accelerate your journey to financial riches.\n\nOver the long term, earnings growth is the primary driver of stock market returns. And, the same principle applies to individual stocks. As growth companies compound revenues, they grow EPS at a higher rate as they achieve scale and show higher operating leverage. As a result, the stock price follows EPS higher.\n\nBut, where do you find these growth stocks with excellent earnings growth potential? The best areas for growth are new industries or technologies where companies have a long growth runway. The secular growth in cybersecurity, cosmetics and the cloud backs their bullish thesis. Today, they offer substantial gains as they grow in their respective industries.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) logo on corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best ways to capitalize on the cybersecurity theme and get rich is by buying Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). The company remains one of the best growth stocks in the technology sector.\n\nCyberthreats are becoming more intense, as the recent Change Healthcare cyber attack proved. With hackers leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and some state actors involved for geopolitical reasons, the threat environment will remain elevated. Thus, the heightened threat plus regulatory requirements like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rules make cyber investments a priority for companies.\n\nAlso, Palo Alto Networks is well-positioned to profit from these trends. The fact that Change Healthcare contracted the company to clean up its attack highlights its competitive advantage. Moreover, its growth in recent years reinforces this view. Revenues have grown at a 23% compounded annual growth rate over the past five years.\n\nStill, despite its scale, it is reporting impressive growth. In the recent third quarter of fiscal year 2024, revenues grew 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $2 billion. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% YOY to $11.3 billion. Furthermore, profitability was impressive, with non-GAAP net income of $454.9 million, increasing 26.5% YOY.\n\nWith a robust platform offering product leadership in 23 cyber categories, Palo Alto Networks is the most comprehensive defense platform. At 12 times forward EV/Sales, PANW stock is set for impressive annual returns.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter another blowout quarter on May 22, e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) remains one of the top growth stocks to buy. Indeed, investors were impressed by the quarter, and as a result, the stock soared 18%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom a fundamental standpoint, Q4 of fiscal year 2024 highlighted continued solid execution on all measures. And, looking at full-year financial results, revenues were up an impressive 77%. So, this was the company\u2019s best fiscal year performance in terms of revenue growth.\n\nThe reports get better! e.l.f. Beauty increased its market share for the fifth consecutive year. Moreover, Q4 of fiscal year 2024 was the 21st consecutive quarter of both market share and revenue growth. On that note, market share increased by 325 basis points.\n\nRegarding 2025, the beauty brand issued a rosy outlook predicting $1.23 to 1.25 billion in revenues, representing 20-22% growth. e.l.f. Beauty is well positioned to achieve these targets due to its value. While legacy competitive brands cost $9.50 and $20 per product, respectively, ELF\u2019s average price point is $6.50.\n\nLastly, the cosmetics maker continues to lead with innovation. It holds the number one or two position in 18 cosmetic segments, comprising about 80% of its cosmetic sales. Thus, with such a powerful franchise offering value, ELF stock will soar.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake (SNOW) IPO on the NYSE\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis data warehouse and data lake company is betting on its data cloud and artificial intelligence integrations to deliver the next growth phase. After 34% YOY growth in the recent quarter, Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) remains on its growth trajectory.\n\nAI bridges structured and unstructured data and will allow customers to extract valuable information from their mountains of data. That\u2019s why Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sridhar Ramaswamy believes that it will turbocharge Snowflake\u2019s capabilities. On the earnings call, he noted that AI would improve Snowflake\u2019s product across the data, collaboration and application layers.\n\nAnd, the company has been investing in AI products like Cortex, which is already available to customers. Cortex AI is ramping up, with 750 enterprise customers using the product. Other AI products like Iceberg, Snowpark Container Services and Hybrid Tables will be available later this year. Also, the company announced it had developed its own large language model, Artic, which outperformed leading models like Mixtral 8x7B and LLaMA-2-70B in benchmark tests.\n\nTherefore, Snowflake is a top enterprise AI data platform. Upcoming AI products will drive revenue acceleration, making it one of the best growth stocks to buy. SNOW stock is a buy, considering its 34% product revenue growth and 128% net revenue retention.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in ELF did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Buying stocks can lead to more wealth. Your money will work for you and push you closer toward meaningful financial goals. However, you have to invest in the right stocks to increase your chances of success.\n\nCorporations with rising revenue and profit margins look promising. These companies also need to have competitive advantages and plenty of runway in addition to having strong financials. These three stocks to buy exhibit those characteristics and can bring your portfolio higher.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis stock has delivered generational wealth for its long-term investors. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is up by more than 2,700% over the past five years and has more than doubled year-to-date.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia\u2019s Blackwell platform is leading the AI boom and has poised the company for the next wave of growth. The company\u2019s innovative AI technology resulted in 262% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25. Profit margins also improved based on the firm\u2019s 628% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nNvidia also stirred up excitement with its 10-for-1 stock split. While stock splits do not make a company more valuable, this stock split has a few benefits that can further push up the stock price. The first advantage is that a lower stock price can increase the likelihood of Nvidia getting added to the Dow Jones Index.\n\nThe second perk is that a lower price per share should stimulate options trading. Options can increase the volatility of the underlying asset and lead to more gains if the majority of options traders buy calls. Given Nvidia\u2019s historical gains and strong financial performance, it\u2019s likely that NVDA calls outpace its put options.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) delivered an exceptional earnings report as other beauty brands warned about slower sales growth. The company had its first fiscal year of more than $1 billion in net sales which was a 77% year-over-year increase. Q4 FY24 revenue was up by 71% year-over-year and came to $321.1 million. Net income was down by roughly 12 year-over-year and came to $14.5 million.\n\nElf Beauty\u2019s guidance implies a net sales increase of 20% to 22% year-over-year in fiscal 2025. This lower guidance initially scared away investors, but Elf Beauty has a history of significantly outperforming its benchmarks and raising its full-year guidance. Elf Beauty raised its guidance in the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe cosmetics company forecasted a 22%-24% year-over-year revenue increase for fiscal 2024. Leadership has regularly issued modest guidance so it can easily beat and raise its benchmarks. That\u2019s why shares rocketed up by 15% upon the earnings release. While guidance looks discouraging, Elf Beauty followed the same script in 2024. The company forecasted 22%-24% growth and ended up with 77% year-over-year net sales growth instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a top fast food restaurant that offers healthier choices than most of its competitors. This dynamic has allowed Chipotle to raise its prices multiple times without losing traction. While other fast food restaurants have lost demand due to price fatigue, Chipotle\u2019s earnings report told a different story.\n\nQ1 2024 revenue increased for the Mexican restaurant chain by 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion. Diluted EPS increased by 23.9% year-over-year to reach $13.01 per share.\u00a0 Chipotle also opened 47 new restaurants and remains on track to open 285-315 new restaurants this year.\n\nChipotle has a long-term goal of more than doubling its domestic business and expanding internationally. Those ambitions combined with a quality experience suggest the stock can rally for several years. So far, Chipotle is living up to the hype. Shares are up by 40% year-to-date and have surged by 373% over the past five years. A recently announced stock split should spur additional demand for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and ELF.

        "title": "ELF, TPR, TJX: Which \u201cStrong Buy\u201d Retail Stock Is the Better Bet?",
        "content": "The consumer seems to be behaving in mysterious ways lately. With inflation coming back down and purse tightening still in effect, in some places more than others, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to get an accurate read of the consumer. They choose to splurge on certain luxuries, conveniences, and experiences but not at the grocery aisle. Given these dynamics, in this piece, we\u2019ll check in with TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool below to see how three Strong-Buy-rated discretionary retailers \u2014 ELF, TRP, and TJX \u2014 stack up over the year ahead.\n\nAs inflation touches down, with the odd price cuts potentially in the cards for certain items, I find that the consumer stands to get a lot healthier from here. As they spend more on specific discretionary goods, we may be getting a hint of where consumers are headed next.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF)\n\nShares of cosmetics retailer e.l.f. Beauty shot up nearly 19% on Thursday, leaving the rest of the market in the dust as it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that were much better than expected. Indeed, the opportunity to grab ELF stock on the dip may have come and gone. The good news is that the disruptive cosmetics company is still down 14% from its all-time high of $221.83 per share.\n\nWith so much brand momentum and appeal with younger consumers, I expect more outperformance ahead as e.l.f. Beauty looks to grab more market share to fuel its growth. All things considered, I\u2019m staying bullish on the stock, even after its remarkable post-quarter pop.\n\nFor Fiscal Q4 2024, e.l.f. saw revenue soar 77% year-over-year. Such scorching growth also accompanied a 140 bps improvement in EBITDA margins. Undoubtedly, the magnitude of sales growth and margin gains is simply not sustainable. That said, the boom could easily last for a while longer and help power shares to greater heights. In a way, e.l.f. seems to be like the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) of the beauty industry.\n\nAs the $10.7 billion disruptive cosmetics industry newcomer looks to replicate success in international markets (think Canada and the UK), there may still be room to extend the run. Nonetheless, expectations are bound to adjust to the downside after the firm called for slower growth for the rest of its fiscal year.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of ELF Stock?\n\nELF stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average ELF stock price target of $203.64 implies 6.4% upside potential.\n\nTapestry (NYSE:TPR)\n\nTapestry is the house behind such \u201caccessible\u201d luxury brands as Coach and Kate Spade. These are goods, like leather bags and wallets that are classy and upscale but not wildly expensive as the likes of a Dior or a Chanel. The stock has been on a wild ride over the past year, crashing and blasting off in a matter of months. Such volatility could persist for some time as Tapestry looks to acquire its way to greater growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough the medium-term could see more steep swings, I must say I like the longer-term trajectory, even after news broke that the Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) acquisition (Tapestry is trying to acquire Capri, another luxury retail company) is being blocked by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nSure, a Capri deal would have further solidified Tapestry\u2019s moat, with new brands such as Versace and Jimmy Choo joining the mix. Regardless, Tapestry still has plenty of places where it can put the extra cash if no deal happens. Perhaps trimming away at debt and buying back shares while they\u2019re relatively cheap could prove wise if a deal can\u2019t be completed by year\u2019s end at the hands of the FTC.\n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019m staying bullish while shares trade at 10.9 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), just below the luxury goods industry average of 11.2 times P/E. Indeed, dip-buyers who pursued the name have been rewarded greatly.\n\nAs it stands today, TPR stock is in a better spot than it was in the back half of last year, with a lower bar to pass (revenue expectations have fallen to \u201cmore than $6.6 billion,\u201d $100 million less than what analysts had hoped for).\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TPR Stock?\n\nTPR stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with seven Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average TPR stock price target of $50.75 implies 20% upside potential.\n\nThe TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX)\n\nTJX Companies stock is in the midst of a nice multi-year bull run and recently made a new all-time high. The off-price retailer has continued to feed the hunger for discretionary bargains amid inflation\u2019s painful pinch. With another strong earnings beat in the books for its recent fiscal second quarter (earnings per share of $0.93, ahead of the $0.88 expectation), it seems like the appetite for discounts is not fading.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m staying bullish on TJX stock at 24.8 times trailing P/E as it continues to deliver on that sought-after \u201coffline treasure hunt experience.\u201d\n\nSame-store sales were up a modest 3% for the quarter \u2014 not incredible, but still decent for a retailer of nice-to-have goods. UBS (NYSE:UBS) analyst Jay Sole is a big fan of the stock, recently upgrading to Buy from Hold while hiking his price target by $28.00 to $132.00 per share.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind Sole\u2019s big upgrade? He sees \u201cbig potential\u201d in some of TJX\u2019s \u201cnewer businesses\u201d in addition to the European business. Additionally, Sole no longer sees the firm\u2019s lacking digital presence as an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d He\u2019s absolutely right.\n\nPerhaps staying mostly offline has been an edge for TJX. After all, you can\u2019t really have that same \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d experience online as you would at a brick-and-mortar location. And given the costs associated with a digital storefront, the deals (or earnings) probably wouldn\u2019t have been as good as they are now.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of TJX Stock?\n\nTJX stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 19 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average TJX stock price target of $114.44 implies 12% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsumers are becoming more selective about how and where they spend. The following three retail plays have sound value propositions relative to their industry rivals. This is bound to help them as inflation-hit folks seek out good deals on high-quality discretionary goods. Overall, out of the three stocks, analysts see the most upside from TPR stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "e.l.f. Beauty Stock (NYSE:ELF): Its Rapid Growth Isn\u2019t Just Cosmetic",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a surprising standout this week, and the company\u2019s impressive growth isn\u2019t just surface-level or cosmetic. e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s excellent financial performance is real and undeniable, and the company\u2019s forward guidance should reassure reluctant shareholders. Therefore, even after today\u2019s huge share-price rally, I am still bullish on ELF stock.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is a cosmetics company with a \u201cfocus on clean, cruelty free and vegan products.\u201d There\u2019s a pretty good chance that you might have seen e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s advertisements on social media.\n\nThe billion-dollar question is has e.l.f. Beauty been able to defeat the inflation monster and ramp up its sales this year? The answer is definitely yes, and e.l.f. Beauty apparently expects the consumer to remain resilient throughout Fiscal Year 2025. So, let\u2019s see why there\u2019s a strong bullish argument to consider buying ELF stock, even after the recent vertical share-price move.\n\nELF Stock Heads Toward $200 on Impressive Results\n\ne.l.f. Beauty stock ran almost 20% higher today and headed toward $200 on unusually heavy trading volume. All of a sudden, e.l.f. Beauty was trending, even though it\u2019s usually not a hot topic of conversation. The catalyst was e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s fourth-quarter Fiscal Year 2024 results and Fiscal Year 2025 guidance. However, even prior to the data release, some analysts seemed to sense that e.l.f. Beauty would deliver impressive results.\n\nFor example, according to TheFly, Canaccord analyst Susan Anderson previewed e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s fourth-quarter results and remained bullish on ELF stock \u201cdue to continued strong demand across the entire portfolio.\u201d However, the Canaccord analyst expected e.l.f. Beauty to \u201cguide typically conservative with the top line potentially in the teens range\u201d \u2013 but we\u2019ll get to that topic in a moment. In any case, Canaccord reiterated its Buy rating as well as its $214 price target on e.l.f. Beauty stock.\n\nMeanwhile, Piper Sandler analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer assigned an Overweight rating and a $216 price target to e.l.f. Beauty shares prior to the quarterly data release. On the other hand, Wolfmeyer expressed concerns that a \u201clighter than hoped for outlook\u2026 could limit share appreciation in the very near-term.\u201d As we\u2019ll see, though, there\u2019s no need to worry too much about that.\n\nIn contrast, Stifel analysts published a Hold rating and a $151 price target on ELF stock. Nevertheless, Stifel seemed fairly optimistic as the firm saw \u201cupside to consensus sales expectations for Q4\u201d and viewed Fiscal Year 2025 estimates as \u201c\u2018reasonable\u2019 based on a deep dive of e.l.f.\u2019s sales by segment.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs it turns out, the more optimistic analysts were spot-on, as e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s fourth-quarter 2024 net revenue\u00a0rocketed 71% higher year-over-year to $321.1 million. This result easily surpassed the consensus estimate of $293.2 million in quarterly revenue.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty Looks Forward to a Strong 2025\n\nWhile e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s revenue ramp-up is undeniable, there\u2019s more to e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s growth story than that. In particular, the company\u2019s Q4-FY2024 adjusted earnings of $0.53 per share was 25% higher than the year-earlier quarter\u2019s result of $0.42 per share. Furthermore, this result easily beat Wall Street\u2019s consensus call for earnings of $0.33 per share. The real kicker, though, was e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s guidance for 2025.\n\nDespite persistent inflation, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s outlook for Fiscal Year 2025 \u201creflects an expected 20-22% increase in net sales.\u201d To be more specific, the company anticipates net revenue of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion in FY2025 versus actual FY2024 net revenue of $1.024 billion.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets really interesting. The consensus forecast called for e.l.f. Beauty to generate net sales of $1.27 billion in Fiscal Year 2025. By that measure, e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s sales guidance might be called a \u201cmiss.\u201d\n\nWas it really a \u201cmiss,\u201d though? Forward guidance implying a year-over-year sales increase of 20% to 22% is, in my opinion, optimistic. I\u2019d say that the market agrees with me on this topic since ELF stock took a rocket ride today.\n\nIs ELF Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, ELF comes in as a Strong Buy based on\u00a0eight Buys and two Hold ratings assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average e.l.f. Beauty stock price target is $200.25, implying 8.4% upside potential.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell ELF stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Olivia Tong of Raymond James, with an average return of 120.76% per rating and a 94% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nConclusion: Should You Consider ELF Stock?\n\nAs we discussed, some analysts expressed their forecasts about whether e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s full-year FY2025 guidance would be strong or soft. I\u2019d say that it came in strong, even if e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s sales outlook \u201cmissed\u201d Wall Street\u2019s estimate.\n\nJust as importantly, e.l.f. Beauty posted excellent top-line and bottom-line results for FY2024\u2019s fourth quarter. That\u2019s a beautiful thing to witness during a time of \u201csticky\u201d inflation, wouldn\u2019t you agree? In light of all this, I\u2019m optimistic about ELF stock and would consider buying it today.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "As spending on beauty slows, consumers shift to premium products",
        "content": "US beauty sales slowed in the first quarter of 2024, but consumers are still looking for premium products.\n\nA recent report by Circana found that the prestige beauty industry category saw revenue grow by 9% year over year in Q1. In comparison, the mass market beauty category \u2014 typically drugstore brands \u2014 grew by 2% during the same time period.\n\nPrestige cosmetics mainly consist of brands sold in department stores and boutique-style shops like Sephora (LVMUY) and often belong to a higher echelon in terms of presentation, ingredients, and pricing. In 2023, sales in the category reached $31.7 billion.\n\n\"We're seeing a very strong Q1 in the prestige cosmetic space,\" Orveon CEO Neela Montgomery told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Orveon owns cosmetics brands bareMinerals and Laura Mercier.\n\nAccording to Montgomery, Orveon experienced \"strong, double-digit, and double the rate of category growth\" in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\"But you talk about the broader market \u2014 and this is a sort of 'lipstick effect' that people often talk about in beauty \u2014 we're seeing that prestige is growing at a much faster rate than the mass beauty market,\" she said, adding: \"Those at the higher price points and more luxury positioning and iconic products such as ourselves continue to do well.\"\n\nThe lipstick effect refers to the notion that consumers will still spend money on small luxury items even during economic downturns or when they are low on personal funds. While overall spending on cosmetics is finally normalizing after several strong years of sales growth, consumers are still spending money on prestige items.\n\nAccording to a 2023 McKinsey & Company report, the \"premiumization\" trend in beauty and fragrance is expected to continue in the coming years. McKinsey anticipates the prestige beauty category will grow 8% per year between 2022 and 2027, versus a 5% growth rate for mass beauty.\n\nSephora, a subsidiary of parent company LVMH, had a standout first quarter as the retailer continued opening more stores across the US amid high demand. Rare Beauty and Fenty Beauty, two celebrity-owned companies, are among the most popular cosmetic brands at stores like Sephora and are considered fast-growing.

(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Rare Beauty) (Cindy Ord via Getty Images)\n\n\"We have seen a slowdown in the total category,\" Ulta Beauty (ULTA) CEO Dave Kimbell told investors at a retail conference in April. However, he noted, \"there's a lot of positive signs about how they're engaging with our new brands in stores, online, connecting with our business.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGiven the \"dynamic\" environment for beauty spending, the prestige category is a focus area that Ulta needs to drive improvement on, Kimbell said, adding that the retailer actually \"saw strength in mass ... and then [was] more challenged in prestige.\"\n\n\"We have, on the prestige side, 1,000 new points of distribution in prestige area that is having some impact on our business,\" he said. \"But we're confident in our ability to go through. Our intent, of course, over time is to gain share in every part of our business.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Why Is e.l.f. (ELF) Stock Rocketing Higher Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) jumped 22% in the afternoon session after the company reported first-quarter earnings results. e.l.f. blew past analysts' EPS expectations. Its revenue (up 71% y/y) also outperformed Wall Street's estimates, driven by higher unit volumes and mix. In FY'24, the company surpassed the milestone of $1B in annual sales. On the other hand, its operating margin missed analysts' expectations, and its full-year revenue and earnings guidance missed Wall Street's estimates. The company provided conservative guidance partly due to concerns about macro uncertainty, with the FY'25 sales forecast pointing to a significant growth deceleration and implying 21.1% growth (vs. 77.2% in FY2024). Overall, this was a mixed yet decent quarter for e.l.f.\n\nIs now the time to buy e.l.f.? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\ne.l.f.'s shares are not very volatile than the market average and over the last year have had only 27 moves greater than 5%. Moves this big are very rare for e.l.f. and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 4 months ago, when the company dropped 7.8% on the news that Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight (Buy) to Equal Weight (Hold). The analyst added, \"With the stock nearly tripling since early 2023 and up 10x since the beginning of 2020, the Bull-Bear skew is now slightly negative, which is rare for this growth stock, and we believe valuation reflects outsized growth in the business.\"\n\ne.l.f. is up 36.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $190.86 per share it is still trading 12.2% below its 52-week high of $217.40 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of e.l.f.'s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $16,504.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

        "title": "Why e.l.f. Beauty Stock Made a Big Move Higher Today",
        "content": "Shares of cosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF) made a big move higher on Thursday after the company reported financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. As of 10 a.m. ET, e.l.f Beauty stock was up a strong 14%.\n\nMastering market-share growth\n\nIn its fiscal 2024 (ending in March), e.l.f Beauty generated net sales of over $1 billion, which represents remarkable 77% year-over-year growth. The company appears to have mastered the art of using social media to grow brand awareness, and it's paid off with five straight years of market-share gains.\n\nShares of e.l.f Beauty wobbled in after-hours trading yesterday, in contrast to the big gains this morning. While investors are encouraged with growth, some are already looking ahead to its fiscal 2025. For this upcoming fiscal year, management is only guiding for about 21% top-line growth.\n\nFor some, the slowing growth rate for e.l.f Beauty is a problem. However, 21% growth is still quite good and points to a sixth year of market share gains, which is why investors are more excited than cautious today.\n\nWhat's next for e.l.f Beauty?\n\nI could see e.l.f. Beauty stock cooling down for a spell. With management's full-year guidance, it expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.20 to $3.25. For perspective, it just reported full-year adjusted EPS of $3.18.\n\nSo top-line growth is expected to slow, and adjusted profits are supposed to be essentially flat year over year. Therefore, it's possible that investors won't be as excited in this coming fiscal year as they have been in the past.\n\nThat said, I see reason for e.l.f. Beauty's shareholders to continue holding. Growth is never a straight line -- it ebbs and flows. And management seems to understand viral marketing better than its peers, which is an important strength in the cosmetics space with a relatively low barrier to entry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in e.l.f. Beauty right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in e.l.f.

        "content": "E.l.f. Beauty (ELF) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.53 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.35 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.42 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 51.43%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this cosmetics company would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of 25.42%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty , which belongs to the Zacks Cosmetics industry, posted revenues of $321.14 million for the quarter ended March 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.81%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $187.36 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty shares have added about 10.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 11.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for e.l.f. Beauty?\n\nWhile e.l.f. Beauty has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for e.l.f. Beauty: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.18 on $298.99 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.54 on $1.27 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Cosmetics is currently in the bottom 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector, The Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc. (NAPA), is yet to report results for the quarter ended April 2024.\n\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $92.19 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "e.l.f. (NYSE:ELF) Surprises With Q1 Sales But Stock Drops 10.7%\n\nCosmetics company e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) reported Q1 CY2024 results beating Wall Street analysts' expectations , with revenue up 71.4% year on year to $321.1 million. On the other hand, the company's full-year revenue guidance of $1.24 billion at the midpoint came in 2.4% below analysts' estimates. It made a non-GAAP profit of $0.53 per share, improving from its profit of $0.42 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy e.l.f.? Find out in our full research report.\n\ne.l.f. (ELF) Q1 CY2024 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $321.1 million vs analyst estimates of $292.4 million (9.8% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $0.53 vs analyst estimates of $0.33 (59.7% beat) Management's revenue guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $1.24 billion at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 2.4% and implying 21.1% growth (vs 77.2% in FY2024) Management's EPS (non-GAAP) guidance for the upcoming financial year 2025 is $3.23 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 9.4% Gross Margin (GAAP): 70.7%, up from 68.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow of $34.34 million is up from -$21.65 million in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $8.82 billion\n\n\u201cFiscal 2024 marked our strongest year of net sales growth on record, a continuation of the exceptional, consistent, category-leading growth we\u2019ve delivered,\u201d said Tarang Amin, e.l.f.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which stands for \u2018eyes, lips, face\u2019, offers high-quality beauty products at accessible price points.\n\nPersonal Care\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nSales Growth\n\ne.l.f. is a small consumer staples company, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefitting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. On the other hand, one advantage is that its growth rates can be higher because it's growing off a small base.\n\nAs you can see below, the company's annualized revenue growth rate of 47.6% over the last three years was incredible for a consumer staples business. e.l.f. Total Revenue\n\nThis quarter, e.l.f. reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 71.4%, and its $321.1 million in revenue beat Wall Street's estimates by 9.8%. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects sales to grow 23.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration from this quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense\u2013as long as the price is right. Luckily, we\u2019ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nCash Is King\n\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can't use accounting profits to pay the bills.\n\ne.l.f.'s free cash flow came in at $34.34 million in Q1, in line with the same quarter last year. This result represents a 10.7% free cash flow margin. e.l.f. Free Cash Flow Margin\n\nOver the last two years, e.l.f. has shown strong cash profitability, giving it an edge over its competitors and the option to reinvest or return capital to investors while keeping cash on hand for emergencies. The company's free cash flow margin has averaged 10.1%, quite impressive for a consumer staples business. However, its margin has averaged year-on-year declines of 11.2 percentage points over the last 12 months. Some investors are likely unhappy with these results and would hope to see a reversal soon.\n\nKey Takeaways from e.l.f.'s Q1 Results\n\nWe were impressed by how significantly e.l.f. blew past analysts' EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its operating margin missed analysts' expectations and its full-year revenue and earnings guidance missed Wall Street's estimates. Overall, this was a mixed quarter for e.l.f. with the guidance weighing on shares. The company is down 10.7% on the results and currently trades at $138.89 per share.\n\ne.l.f. may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nView comments",

Adjusted SG&A (SG&A excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $196.9 million, or 61% of net sales. The year over year increase in SG&A dollars was primarily due to an increase in marketing and digital spend, compensation and benefits, operations costs, retail fixturing and visual merchandising costs, depreciation and amortization and professional fees.\n\nNet income was $14.5 million on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income (net income excluding the items identified in the reconciliation table below) was $30.8 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.25 on a GAAP basis.

Adjusted SG&A was $526.4 million, or 51% of net sales. The year over year increase in SG&A dollars was primarily due to an increase in marketing and digital spend, compensation and benefits, operations costs, retail fixturing and visual merchandising costs, depreciation and amortization and professional fees.\n\nNet income was $127.7 million on a GAAP basis. Adjusted net income was $183.8 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $2.21 on a GAAP basis.

The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because its management uses them as supplemental measures in assessing its operating performance, and believes they are helpful to investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance. The non-GAAP measures included in this press release are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to or substitutes for measures of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company\u2019s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing the Company\u2019s results as reported under GAAP. The Company\u2019s definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes expense or income related to stock-based compensation, impairment of equity investment, loss on extinguishment of debt and other non-cash and non-recurring items. Such other non-cash or non-recurring items include amortization of internal-use software costs related to cloud applications, costs related to the acquisition of Naturium, and cloud computing ERP implementation costs.\n\nAdjusted SG&A excludes expense related to stock-based compensation and other non-recurring items. Such other non-recurring items include other non-recurring cloud computing ERP implementation costs and costs related to the acquisition of Naturium.\n\nAdjusted effective tax rate is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of expense or income related to stock-based compensation, other non-cash and non-recurring items, impairment of equity investment, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred.\n\nAdjusted net income excludes expense or income related to stock-based compensation, other non-recurring items, impairment of equity investment, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of acquired intangible assets and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments. Such other non-recurring items include other non-recurring cloud computing ERP implementation costs and costs related to the acquisition of Naturium.\n\nWith respect to the Company\u2019s expectations under \"Fiscal 2025 Outlook\" above, the Company is not able to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance non-GAAP measures to the corresponding net income and diluted earnings per share GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. The Company cannot provide meaningful estimates of the non-recurring charges and credits excluded from these non-GAAP measures due to the forward-looking nature of these estimates and their inherent variability and uncertainty. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including those statements relating to the Company's outlook for fiscal 2025 under \"Fiscal 2025 Outlook\" above and those statements that we believe we are still in the early innings of unlocking the full potential we see for e.l.f. Beauty across cosmetics, skin care and international markets. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include, among other things, the risks and uncertainties that are described in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to effectively compete with other beauty companies; the Company\u2019s ability to successfully introduce new products; the Company's ability to successfully address any difficulties and challenges encountered in connection with its acquisition of Naturium, including the integration of Naturium's business with the Company's business; the Company\u2019s ability to attract new retail customers and/or expand business with its existing retail customers; the Company\u2019s ability to optimize shelf space at its key retail customers; the loss of any of the Company\u2019s key retail customers or if the general business performance of its key retail customers declines; and the Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage its SG&A and other expenses. Potential investors are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available in the future.\n\ne.l.f.

        "content": "Don\u2019t count Metaverse stocks to buy out just yet.\u00a0Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is shifting its focus on building out its artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies. Firms like HSBC are introducing a fund designed to seize opportunities in the metaverse for affluent clients in Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nThis year, the global metaverse e-commerce market\u00a0could grow 30% and reach a value of $30 billion this year. By 2025, the market could be worth $42 billion. By 2030, it could be worth more than $210 billion.\n\nThat being said, use weakness when choosing metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) gapped from about $40 to a low of $30 after cutting its annual bookings forecast. However, with the negativity now priced in, it\u2019s starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $33.59, it\u2019s also starting to pivot from over-extensions on RSI, MACD and Williams\u2019 %R and could soon refill that bearish gap at around $40 again in the near term.\n\nRBLX is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy and hold long term.\n\nMoving forward, RBLX could easily push aggressively higher. For one, the company has about\u00a016 million daily active users in the U.S. who spend about $150 annually.\u00a0There are another 62 million outside of the U.S. who spend an average of about $24 a year.\n\nAlso,\u00a0the company is opening a\u00a0new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD).\n\nIn addition, while we\u2019ve seen multiple firms pile on with price downgrades, the pullback is overdone. The negativity has been priced in. And with the future potential growth of the metaverse, most notably metaverse e-commerce, RBLX is a steal at current prices.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeakness in\u00a0Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a buy opportunity.\n\nBut don\u2019t wait too long to buy.\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $141 in earnings, it\u2019s just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $166.33, I\u2019d like to see AMD retest $180 again shortly. Helping,\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) just added AMD artificial intelligence chips to its cloud computing products.\n\nTwo, analysts at Jefferies initiated coverage of AMD with a buy rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOur views on NVDA and AMD haven\u2019t changed, but the relative move in stock prices YTD causes us to make a tactical shift in priority, moving AMD to the Wolfe Alpha List, replacing NVDA, which is up ~90% YTD and ~100% since it was added to the list in November 2023,\u201d added Wolfe.\n\nWe also must consider that companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) An image of a VR headset and headphones; the word metaverse on the headset. metaverse cryptos\n\nSource: PopTika/Shutterstock\n\nThe last time I mentioned the\u00a0Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), it traded at around $12.41 on May 8. Still rebounding from its dip to $11.40, the METV ETF still offers a solid long-term opportunity on the metaverse.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse\u2019s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include\u00a0Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U) and\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0to name a few of them.\n\nWith some of the top tech heavyweights on board, I\u2019d buy the METV ETF at current prices and check back on it in a few months. From its last traded price of $12.55, I\u2019d like to see it closer to $20, with its holdings in NVDA, AAPL and RBLX expected to explode higher.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper\u00a0did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the\u00a0InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? E.l.f. Beauty (ELF), which belongs to the Zacks Cosmetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\n\nThis cosmetics company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 38.64%.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, e.l.f. Beauty came out with earnings of $0.74 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 per share, representing a surprise of 25.42%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.82 per share, delivering a surprise of 51.85%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.32%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 22, 2024.\n\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues\n\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Beauty (NYSE: ELF) announces a new partnership with Accrington Stanley Women Football Club to support the club on their first international tour. This is a continuation of e.l.f.'s pillar to support women's empowerment through sports.\n\nWith women leadership as a core inspiration for the players, e.l.f. will lean in and raise the stakes by bringing inspiration and empowerment to the team, working with England International Lioness Izzy Christiansen. In addition to supporting the international tour, the partnership includes Christiansen-hosted training sessions for the club, bringing energy to the supporters with interactive activities at games, e.l.f supported kit and a new team mascot, Sticky, who takes the form of e.l.f. holy grail, Power Grip Primer.\n\nAccrington Stanley Women FC is a community-based club based in a manufacturing town in Lancashire in the North of England.\n\nAccrington town has long been portrayed as an underdog, most famously in the 1980s milk advert that featured a little boy who aspired to improve his football and play for a great club. e.l.f.'s ambition with ASWFC is to support a positive narrative around the women and girls, their football potential and continued success.\n\nIn recent weeks, e.l.f. supported the club as they journeyed to the United States to the Dallas Texans International Girls Cup, enabling an enriching, impactful experience for the team's 15 to18-year-olds. It was an opportunity to experience another country, its culture and people; improve their game; showcase their ability; have the chance to be scouted for U.S. university scholarships; and inspire younger players and members of the community to follow in their footsteps.\n\nChristine Cassidy, Vice President and General Manager, International, e.l.f. Beauty, said: \"At e.l.f., our mission is to disrupt norms, shape culture and connect communities, and there is no sport that connects communities in the U.K. more than football. We are here to empower women, so when we discovered that ASWFC's club mantra is ego conventum ad rebellionem concitare (\"I am meeting to raise a rebellion\" in Latin), we knew we had found a club that had the same fire in its belly as we do.\"\n\n\"I am still pinching myself that e.l.f. has partnered with Accrington Stanley Women FC. To have the support of a brand that we share so many core values with means a lot to our integrity and future aspirations,\" Sami Smithson, ASWFC Chairperson, said. \"The support of e.l.f. has been able to put our girls & women, of this small club with big ambition, on the world map as well as continue to inspire and include many girls and women from Accrington and surrounding areas. e.l.f.'s belief in us is something our community is using as a confidence boost on and off the pitch.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSupporting women in sports aligns with e.l.f Beauty's vision to be positive, inclusive and accessible. The company most recently supported the Professional Women's Hockey League in the U.S. and is the primary supporter of race-car driver Katherine Legge in the Indianapolis 500.\n\ne.l.f. is committed to empowering legendary women everywhere. When it comes to women in sports, e.l.f. recently partnered with legendary tennis star and equity advocate Billie Jean King, racecar driver Katherine Legge and the Professional Women's Hockey League in the U.S. Together, they are calling on business leaders and the wider community to \"Change the Board Game\"\u00a0and put more women and diverse candidates on corporate boards.\n\nFor further information please visit elfbeauty.com and follow e.l.f.'s commitment to women in sport on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.

        "title": "Earnings Preview: e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline",
        "content": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 22, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis cosmetics company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $291.54 million, up 55.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\n\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for e.l.f. Beauty?\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -12%.\n\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\n\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that e.l.f. Beauty will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\n\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\n\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that e.l.f. Beauty would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +25.42%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\n\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\n\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) closed the latest trading day at $161.55, indicating a -0.11% change from the previous session's end. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.48%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.75%.\n\nThe cosmetics company's shares have seen a decrease of 1.02% over the last month, not keeping up with the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 6.99% and the S&P 500's gain of 2%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of e.l.f. Beauty in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on May 22, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.34, down 19.05% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $291.54 million, up 55.6% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for e.l.f. Beauty. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.1% lower. Currently, e.l.f. Beauty is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, e.l.f. Beauty is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 45.62. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 25.25 of its industry.\n\nMeanwhile, ELF's PEG ratio is currently 1.27. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ELF's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.49 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Cosmetics industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 149, positioning it in the bottom 41% of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nStory continues\n\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty encourages more diversity across U.S. corporate boards using disruptive campaign to invite other businesses to join movement. (Graphic: Business Wire) e.l.f. Beauty encourages more diversity across U.S. corporate boards using disruptive campaign to invite other businesses to join movement. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nNew campaign, with first-of-its-kind research on inequity in boardrooms, invites other businesses to Change the Board Game\n\nNEW YORK, May 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) is highlighting its ambition to see more diversity in U.S. corporate boardrooms with an eye-catching, disruptive media campaign on digital screens surrounding Wall Street called \"So Many Dicks.\" Revealed today at some of the busiest New York business hubs, this work is the next phase of the company\u2019s \"Change the Board Game\" initiative.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is one of only four U.S. publicly traded companies, out of 4,200+, with a board that's two-thirds women and one-third diverse. The company has reported 20 consecutive quarters of net-sales growth \u2013 only 1 of 5 consumer-goods companies in the U.S. with that current record. e.l.f. Beauty Chairman and CEO Tarang Amin said he believes the company\u2019s unique Board of Directors is helping fuel business growth.\n\n\"One of the most important things a diverse board does is bring in multiple viewpoints to make better decisions. At e.l.f. Beauty, empathy is part of our business model because it brings us closer to our community and the things people in the community care about,\" said Amin. \"A diverse board also helps us stay culturally relevant among multiple affinities. It\u2019s the unique combination and diverse school of thought that helps us lead innovation and brand demand in the industry.\"\n\nRecognizing that putting more diversity in seats of power will take the partnership of other companies, e.l.f.\u2019s ambition is to help double the rate of women and diverse members added to corporate boards by 2027.\n\nTo drive awareness and, especially, motivate change, e.l.f. developed an attention-grabbing campaign that will hit the streets of New York City and across all e.l.f. channels. The out-of-home creative is running now through June 10 around the Financial District, including Fulton Street Station and The Oculus. The units feature bold headlines calling stats about current boards \u2013 and inviting others to learn about how diversity can drive profitability for everyone. These are among the first disruptive amplifications of many more to come in e.l.f.\u2019s long-term commitment to this movement.\n\nWorking with purpose-driven agency OBERLAND, e.l.f. Beauty conducted research on Corporate Boards in the U.S. learning that men named Richard, Rick, or Dick (Dicks) serving on these public company boards outnumbered women and diverse groups.\n\nTo create the data, e.l.f. Beauty and OBERLAND identified and categorized the race and gender of each person serving on the boards of directors of U.S. based companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ using publicly available biographies, images, public statements and information provided in public filings. This included 36,957 existing board members across 4,429 publicly traded U.S. companies. Once the data was in hand, the statistics were astounding.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere were 566 men named Richard, Rick, or Dick (Dicks) serving on these public company boards. Black women and Asian women barely outnumber men named Dick, with only 806 Black Women, 774 Asian Women. There were only 283 Hispanic Women on these same boards, only half the number of \"Dicks.\" There are 19x more men named Dick than the 29 women of Middle Eastern descent on these boards. There are only 3 Native American Women serving on these boards compared to 566 men named Dick.\n\nThat data that fueled \"So Many Dicks\" has never been categorized this way and researched manually, it illuminates underrepresentation in boardrooms that make decisions at companies that fuel the U.S. economy.\n\n\"e.l.f.\u2019s commitment to diverse representation isn\u2019t limited to within the four walls of our company. We want to normalize diversity \u2013 and if it takes some e.l.f.ing in-your-face advertising to do it, we\u2019re happy to put it on some of the biggest screens you can imagine,\" said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer, e.l.f. Beauty. \"The aim of the data, the database and the compelling ad campaign is to invite others with us on this journey to drive real impact and help corporate boards more accurately reflect the world around us.\"\n\ne.l.f. kicked off the \"Change The Board Game\" initiative earlier this year when it announced a partnership with the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and its sponsorship of 20 women and/or diverse board-ready candidates through NACD Accelerate\u2122, a unique, two-year program that creates a pathway for executives to prepare for board service. Each year in the U.S. we typically see around 3% growth of women and diverse candidates on corporate boards, but e.l.f. is aiming for 6% growth by 2027.\n\n\"This campaign demonstrates the ROI of DEI in a way that gets people\u2019s attention, hopefully compelling them to join our cause,\" said Drew Train, Chief Executive Officer, OBERLAND. \"It is our belief that broad representation of the marketplace is part of a successful business plan, and an inclusive workforce and board gives the best context to achieve that.\"\n\ne.l.f. is encouraging existing board members to visit the website and verify/update their gender and race to ensure the database is the most accurate representation of corporate boards in the U.S.\n\nFor more information on \"Change the Board Game,\" visit ChangeTheBoardGame.com.\n\nAbout e.l.f.

        "title": "2 Unbelievable Growth Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "The stock market has taken investors for a wild ride these last few years. When you're investing in stocks for many years, though, even multiple tough market cycles shouldn't deter you from your core investing thesis about quality companies.\n\nEven as the S&P 500 has had a pretty fantastic 2024 so far, becoming a part owner of great businesses is what you should focus on as a long-term investor. Here are two top stocks to consider buying now that you can hold for at least a decade.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: VRTX) hasn't been resting on its laurels. The ongoing success of its market-leading cystic fibrosis drug franchise has paved the way to a bright future as it continues to develop an impressive lineup of medicines targeting various rare, underserved diseases.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company reported total profits of $1.1 billion on revenue of $2.7 billion. Those two figures represented respective increases of 57% and 13% from the same quarter in 2023. Vertex closed out the three-month period with a hefty $10 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet.\n\nVertex continues to benefit from high demand for its cystic fibrosis drugs. These drugs are helping patients live better and longer because they target the underlying genetic factors that cause cystic fibrosis. That durable need for Vertex's medicines, additional label expansions to younger groups of cystic fibrosis patients, and a massive patient population continue to form a wide moat for this mainstay of Vertex's business.\n\nMeanwhile, the company is looking to a new era of growth as it plans multiple new product launches before the end of the decade, each with significant blockbuster potential. It's in the process of launching its new gene editing therapy Casgevy, which it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics and which serves as a onetime functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.\n\nVertex just completed regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU for its new triple combination cystic fibrosis therapy for patients aged six and up, which addresses 31 rare mutations that Vertex's current lineup of medicines do not.\n\nManagement has also estimated that over 6,000 patients who have stopped taking its existing drugs might be interested in this new treatment option. This is just a fraction of the total addressable market for its cystic fibrosis franchise that Vertex previously estimated at around 92,000 people in Europe, North America, and Australia alone.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuzetrigine is another potential blockbuster for Vertex, as a non-opioid drug that addresses multiple acute pain ailments. Vertex has initiated its rolling new drug application submission for Suzetrigine to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for moderate-to-severe acute pain. It's about to start the phase 3 trial studying the drug as a treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThese are just a handful of the exciting updates about Vertex's pipeline. It also just announced that it plans to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences, a company that makes protein-based medicines for various immune disorders. The company's lead candidate, povetacicept, is being developed as a treatment for the underlying cause of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), which no commercialized drug currently addresses.\n\nVertex is already coming from a position of considerable strength with its market leadership in cystic fibrosis therapies that underpin a rock-solid balance sheet. Now looks like as good a time as ever to scoop up even a few shares of this top healthcare stock.\n\n2. e.l.f. Beauty\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) has evolved significantly over the years, while keeping its focus on affordable, high-quality cosmetics and skincare at the forefront. The company first launched two decades ago as an online-only business.\n\nOriginally, e.l.f. only sold about a dozen products at the mere price of $1 each. Today, e.l.f. boasts a storied status as a hugely popular beauty brand with both millennial and Gen Z shoppers looking for premium makeup in a wallet-friendly price range, often as substitutes for well-known name brands.\n\nThe company is known for its TikTok campaigns, partnerships with celebrities, and creative ad initiatives that target this core consumer audience. Its family of brands includes clean beauty brands e.l.f. Cosmetics and Well People, and clean skincare brands e.l.f. SKIN, Naturium, and Keys Soulcare.\n\nAt one point, the company owned its own brick-and-mortar stores, but its bread-and-butter has been its strong online presence and lucrative partnerships with big name retailers like Target, Walmart, and Ulta Beauty. In the company's fiscal 2023, these three retailers comprised 25%, 20%, and 15%, respectively, of the company's total net sales.\n\nAccessible prices for quality cosmetics and skincare products are a compelling buying proposition for customers in any market environment. While the beauty industry has long been the subject of feverish consumer spending, the online beauty trend fueled by social media is a newer phenomenon that e.l.f. has adeptly tapped into.\n\nIn the first nine months of e.l.f.'s fiscal 2024 that ended on Dec. 31, it generated net sales of $703 million, up 80% from the same period the prior year. Net income for the nine-month period totaled $113 million, and e.l.f. closed out that time frame with about $73 million in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nTrailing 12-month operating cash flow for this business comes in at around $67 million. e.l.f. also has a relatively asset-light business thanks to its long-standing partnerships with third-party suppliers (a common but effective model in the beauty space).\n\nWith a robust online and brick-and-mortar retail network, and an increasingly impressive balance sheet, e.l.f. looks like a business to watch closely. Investors with cash to spare may also want to start or add to a position in this beauty stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy in May 2024",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still losing billions of dollars on the metaverse. In fact, in the company\u2019s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent a good deal of time talking about how Meta loses money, including the $3.8 billion it lost on the metaverse. Still, Zuckerberg isn\u2019t giving up on the metaverse just yet, which is creating opportunity for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s now associating his metaverse plans with artificial intelligence.\u00a0As noted by a LinkedIn.com article, \u201cZuckerberg believes that the integration of AI and the metaverse will revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other.\u201d\n\nEven companies like\u00a0Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are selling \u201creal world\u201d goods in the Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) gaming environment, which is reigniting metaverse commerce, says ChainStoreAge.com.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\u201cWalmart\u2019s\u00a0IRL commerce shop\u00a0in its Roblox experience enables users to check out real world items chosen by its partner user generated content (UGC) creators.\u00a0Walmart is adjusting its merchandising strategy to fit the metaverse, which by itself should make metaverse and retail observers sit up and take notice,\u201d\u00a0they added.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t off the metaverse just yet. Instead, you may want to use weakness as an opportunity with some of the best metaverse stocks to buy today, such as:\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A child playing Roblox on a smartphone.\n\nSource: Katya Rekina/ Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best metaverse stocks to buy today is Roblox.\n\nFor one, after plummeting to a low of $33.71, Roblox is exploding higher. Last trading at $40.54, if it can break above double-top resistance, it could test $43 next.\n\nTwo, the company is opening a\u00a0new ad format as it looks for more ways to monetize its free games. That will include video ads running on virtual billboards and other screens from companies like e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE:ELF), Walmart and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). By doing so, advertisers will be able to reach more than half of its 71.5 million daily active users.\n\nThree, Roblox is also running on a JPMorgan upgrade, with a price target of $48.\n\n\u201cThe crux of our bull thesis is that we believe RBLX has a\u00a0significant monetization opportunity ($0.06 per hour with 80% of hours not monetized) and [management\u2019s] focus on margin leverage, which we expect to result in FCF compounding 40%+ through 2027,\u201d\u00a0said the firm, as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s also the\u00a0Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV). With an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF holds 38 metaverse-related holdings, all of which should benefit from the metaverse\u2019s potential $5 trillion impact by 2030. Some of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Roblox, Meta Platforms, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Unity Software (NYSE:U), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to name a few of them.\n\nAt the moment, the ETF trades at just under $12.50, so I can spend about $1,250 for 100 shares. And I can diversify with the fund\u2019s 38 holdings. Or, I can go out and just buy 100 shares of Nvidia and spend closer to $91,000.\n\nSince bottoming out at around $7 in late 2022, the ETF exploded to a recent high of $12.49. From here, if the metaverse story can gain traction, it could double, if not triple in value\u2014with a good deal of patience. With the METV ETF, simply buy it, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nDown but not out, shares of Unity Software are sitting at strong support. In fact, if you pull up a two-year chart, you can see it\u2019s holding and bouncing from the same support level for the seventh time since Nov. 2022. From its current price of $25.32, based on history, we\u2019d like to see it retest around $35 a share.\n\nHelping, analysts at\u00a0William Blair have a buy rating on the stock. Analysts at Wedbush have an outperform rating on the stock, with a price target of $33.50.\n\nAnd, as noted by\u00a0Investorplace contributor Jeremy Flint, \u201cUnity generates positive cash flow through a substantial advertising network. The ability to generate profit bolsters Unity\u2019s stability amid broader market volatility, sustaining the company until metaverse investments garner broader institutional appeal.\u201d\n\nMuch like the METV ETF, buy Unity Software, forget about it, and check back in on it in a few months. I\u2019d like to see this one double, with patience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search e.l.f. Beauty (ELF): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this cosmetics company have returned -3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Cosmetics industry, which e.l.f. Beauty falls in, has lost 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, e.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, indicating a change of -19.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.06 points to a change of +84.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.55 indicates a change of +16% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, e.l.f. Beauty is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for ELF _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $291.54 million indicates a year-over-year change of +55.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $994.32 million and $1.27 billion estimates indicate +71.8% and +27.5% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\ne.l.f. Beauty reported revenues of $270.94 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +84.9%. EPS of $0.74 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $239.66 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.05%. The EPS surprise was +25.42%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about e.l.f. Beauty. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Buy in May and go away. That investing maxim suggests investors should walk away from the market in Spring and not return again till October. Historical data supports the May to October period as the worst-performing six-month period of the year.\n\nAnalysts at LPL Financial found that from 1950 on, the S&P 500 returned just 1.8% on average. But whatever you do, don\u2019t invest in September! That month is the worst for the index with a long-term average return of negative 0.7%.\n\nOf course, this is said facetiously. Investors should not be investing for a month or even six months. They should have a long-term mindset when buying stocks, aiming to hold them for three to five years at a minimum, though a decade or more is preferable. Or in the words of Warren Buffett, the best time to sell is never!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd that May-to-October investing bromide is really just for index investors. Stock pickers should look to buy shares whenever they offer discounts to their intrinsic value.\n\nSo even though it is May, the following three companies are some of the top stocks to invest $10,000 in today to enjoy long-lasting returns.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter nearly tripling in value last year and getting off to a rip-snorting start in 2024, cosmetics leader e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) took a breather. Shares pulled back 27% from their all-time high in early March. The stock is still up 11% year-to-date (YTD). So, investors should view this as the pause that refreshes.\n\nAccording to the recently released Taking Stock With Teens semi-annual survey, analysts at Piper Sandler say e.l.f. Beauty remains the No. 1 cosmetics brand in the country amongst female teens. The company widened its lead by 16 percentage points from last year and now commands a 38% share of the market. It is also one of the top 10 skincare brands and beauty destinations.\n\nIn addition, the survey showed the beauty market is a high priority. The average spend of $339 rose to its highest level since the spring of 2018. Analysts forecast e.l.f. Beauty will grow earnings at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% for the next five years. And, they have a $206 per share consensus one-year price target on the stock, implying 28% growth still to come. Thus, e.l.f. Beauty stock looks like an unstoppable force no matter what month it is.\n\nHudson Technologies (HDSN) a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and more\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Digital Genetics\n\nGreen refrigerant specialist Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN) doesn\u2019t seem quite as exciting as a fast-growing cosmetics stock. But don\u2019t let appearances fool you. This is not putting lipstick on a pig. Significant tailwinds are behind this company even if its stock price doesn\u2019t yet reflect them. In fact, it\u2019s good they don\u2019t show up yet because that gives investors plenty of time to get in ahead of the crowd.\n\nStory continues\n\nCall it the Law of Unintended Consequences. In 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a widely used class of refrigerants that were supposedly eating a hole in the world\u2019s ozone later (turns out the threat was greatly exaggerated). In their place, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), were developed. Now the government wants them banned, too.\n\nFour years ago the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act was passed, which phases out use of virgin HFCs. By 2038, they are to be reduced by 85%. These refrigerants are the sort used in home central air conditioning and car AC systems.\n\nHudson Technologies is the biggest player in the green refrigerant market with a 35% share. As the law cuts into available supplies, demand for reclaimed refrigerants will grow. HDSN stock is down 40% from the highs it hit. But don\u2019t expect it to last. Refrigerants are going to get scarce very quickly, making Hudson Technologies will be the main beneficiary.\n\nLVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY) Louis Vuitton storefront featuring an LV handbag. LVMUY stock.\n\nSource: Vietnam stock photos / Shutterstock\n\nThe hand of the government is also behind the recent decline in the stock of luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTCMKTS:LVMUY). Even the rich have their limits on how long they can maintain their spending in the face of rising inflation and high interest rates.\n\nShares of the owner of Luis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany and other prestigious high-fashion names saw its stock fall 13% following first-quarter earnings after growth rapidly pulled back in difficult economic conditions. Shares that had run up 17% higher to start the new year are now only up 3%.\n\nSpending in the U.S., its largest market, fell from 8% growth to 2%, while the luxury house\u2019s second biggest region Asia (minus Japan) went from a 14% gain last year to a 6% decline this year. Japan, though, went from strength to strength. Sales rose 34% last year and are up 32% so far in 2024.\n\nYet LVMH still has plenty of growth prospects ahead of it. The luxury goods house was going up against some difficult comparables from the year-ago period, which was its first post-pandemic-free quarter. It will likely have a few more tough comparisons to get through but should resume its growth trajectory once it laps them.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in LVMUY stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nRich Duprey has written about stocks and investing for the past 20 years. His articles have appeared on Nasdaq.com, The Motley Fool, and Yahoo! Finance, and he has been referenced by U.S. and international publications, including MarketWatch, Financial Times, Forbes, Fast Company, USA Today, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Cheddar News, The Boston Globe, L\u2019Express, and numerous other news outlets.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You\u2019ve Never Heard Of Musk\u2019s \u201cProject Omega\u201d May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global cosmetics market, beauty and sustainability come together, and recent acquisitions in the beauty industry go directly to the 5 Best Cream Blushes For Flawlessly Flushed Cheeks.\n\nGlobal Cosmetics Market:\n\nThe size of the worldwide cosmetics market was estimated at $374.18 billion in 2023, and it is expected to rise, per Fortune Business Insights, at a CAGR of 9.8% from $393.75 billion in 2024 to $758.05 billion by 2032. Asia Pacific held the dominant market share, estimated at $147.92 billion in 2023.\n\nThis report states that the rise of the cosmetics sector is being driven by a growing worldwide concern among people about personal appearance and well-being. These products can improve someone's overall appearance. A small number of multinational businesses have influence over the manufacture of such products. To meet each client's unique cosmetic needs, these companies provide an extensive range of skincare, hair care, and lip care products.\n\nAdditionally, Fortune Business Insights points out that customers are being drawn to the growing number of anti-aging product launches, the creation of creative and practical package concepts, and small, portable containers. Producers are concentrating on creating an array of products that can satisfy the particular demands of each person.\n\nAccording to Precedence Research, \u200b\u200bthe size of the US cosmetics industry exceeded $87.70 billion in 2022. It is expected to reach around $150.50 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 5.60% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nThe overall sales of premium cosmetic products in the United States increased by 15%. In particular, the NPD Group reported that skincare sales rose by 12% in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the global skincare products market size was valued at $135.83 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to boom between 2023 and 2030 at a CAGR of 4.7, as we have mentioned in our article, \u201c20 Highest Quality Skincare Brands in 2024.\u201d\n\nBeauty and Sustainability Come Together:\n\nThere is a significant shift taking place in the cosmetics sector. Sustainable beauty is leading the way toward a more ecologically conscious future by adopting sustainable packaging, utilizing eco-friendly ingredients, and rising consumer trends.\n\nThe \"Global Vegan Cosmetics Market Outlook, 2028\" research study projects that the vegan cosmetics industry will grow from $17.39 billion in 2022 to over $24 billion by 2028.

        "title": "Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)?",
        "content": "With its stock down 11% over the past week, it is easy to disregard e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study e.l.f. Beauty's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nSee our latest analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for e.l.f. Beauty is:\n\n21% = US$129m \u00f7 US$614m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty's Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nTo begin with, e.l.f. Beauty seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. Probably as a result of this, e.l.f. Beauty was able to see an impressive net income growth of 64% over the last five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nAs a next step, we compared e.l.f. Beauty's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 10%. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ELF? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs e.l.f. Beauty Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\ne.l.f. Beauty doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with e.l.f. Beauty's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Some of these dips only last a few days, while others can extend for several months. When great stocks go on sale, investors can accumulate more shares with the same amount of capital.\n\nThese bargain deals don\u2019t last forever, as investors soon remember the long-term growth prospects of stocks on the discount rack. These discounted stocks have outperformed the market but are offering investors a second chance due to recent pullbacks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become the most undervalued stock among the Magnificent Seven cohort. Shares dropped 10% on a good earnings report. Some investors wanted more, but the company delivered good earnings and only trades at a 25.9 P/E ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY), while net income surged by 117% YoY. Daily active users grew 7% YoY to reach 3.24 billion users among its platforms. Meta Platforms also stands to benefit if the TikTok ban goes through.\n\nThe deadline is January 19, 2025, one day before the next presidential inauguration. ByteDance stated it will not sell TikTok. The app reached 150 million American users in March 2023. It\u2019s very safe to assume the number has soared since then. These users will have to use other social networks to fill in the time if the January 19th ban passes. Meta Platforms stands to benefit. The company has gained 26% year-to-date.\n\nE.l.f.

It\u2019s gained more than 1,150% over the past five years and has a decent 13% year-to-date gain. However, the stock is in the middle of a correction heading into its next earnings report. Investors were spooked over a warning from Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) about softening demand for its beauty products.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty has been growing at a faster rate than Ulta. The smaller firm has also been gaining more market share. ELF delivered 85% YoY net sales growth and gained 305 basis points of market share in Q3 FY24.\n\nThe latest earnings report extended e.l.f. Beauty\u2019s streak to 20 consecutive quarters of growth. Net income jumped by 41% YoY, and the company significantly raised its fiscal 2024 guidance for net sales, net income and other metrics. The future looks bright for the beauty firm, and the recent pullback offers an opportunity for patient investors.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nStory continues\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) generated a lot of buzz about its add to the S&P 500. The athletic apparel giant is up 25% year-to-date and has soared by 431% over the past five years. Despite the long-term gains, Deckers Outdoor is in the middle of a correction. Shares are down by more than 12% from their all-time high.\n\nThe company has several popular brands under its corporate umbrella, such as UGG and HOKA. Those two brands helped Deckers Outdoor deliver 16% YoY net sales growth in Q3 FY24. Diluted EPS jumped by 44% YoY as the corporation improved its profit margins. The HOKA brand stood out with 21.9% YoY revenue growth.\n\nDeckers Outdoor is still growing, while larger competitors like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are faltering.

Beauty to Change the Board Game to support inclusivity.\n\nBillie Jean King and e.l.f. Highlight the Business and Community Benefits of Diverse Corporate Boards of Directors\n\nNEW YORK, May 02, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Legendary tennis star and equity advocate Billie Jean King and e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) are calling on U.S. business leaders and the wider community to \"Change the Board Game\" and put more women and diverse candidates on corporate boards.\n\n\"Fighting for gender equality and inclusivity has been the driving force in my life for 70 years. Change is often a slow process and those in positions of power can bring about change quicker. e.l.f. Beauty is leading change in the boardroom and showing us investment in equality and inclusivity will ultimately be rewarded with tangible results,\" said King.\n\nKing previously partnered with e.l.f. to commemorate the 50-year milestones of the \"Battle of the Sexes\" and equal prize money at the U.S. Open.\n\nIn a new campaign that supports e.l.f.\u2019s wider \"Board Game\" initiative, King picks up her racket and launches fact-filled tennis balls at an in-progress board meeting. She serves up, for example:\n\nWomen make up only 27% of U.S. corporate boards* The average U.S. corporate board is 88% white*\n\ne.l.f.\u2019s long-time partner agency for purpose work OBERLAND created these comical but impactful spots with O-Positive Production Company and Director Miranda Haymon to highlight the inequity at the top of America\u2019s companies.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty is one of only four publicly traded U.S. companies out of 4,200 with a board of directors composed of two-thirds women and one-third diverse representation.**\n\n\"e.l.f. Beauty believes it is important that it reflects the diverse communities we serve, and that means everywhere. We believe that the inclusivity of our Board of Directors and Executive Team has been a driving factor in our extraordinary business results over the last five years. Doing the right thing is good for our community - and good for business: e.l.f. has proven that with 20 consecutive quarters of net sales growth***,\" said Kory Marchisotto, Chief Marketing Officer, e.l.f. Beauty. \"We are asking our peers and partners to join us in increasing diversity in the highest seats of power. Change the board game, normalize diversity, change the world.\"\n\n\"Serving Facts\" also highlights e.l.f.\u2019s partnership with the National Association of Corporate Boards (NACD) to create a trailblazing board accelerator program that trains and creates visibility for 20 women and/or diverse board-ready candidates. NACD Accelerated is a unique, two-year program that creates a pathway for executives to prepare for board service.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe \"Serving Facts\" spots were developed to complement an informative animated \"Better Board\" video, also produced by OBERLAND, with powerful, proprietary statistics about the inequality that still exists on corporate boards in 2024. This initiative is part of an ongoing awareness-and-action campaign with additional activations to come.\n\nLisa Topol, Executive Creative Director and Managing Partner at OBERLAND says, \"Billie Jean King is the perfect partner for this initiative. Not only is she a tireless warrior for equality in sports, but she takes the fight wherever it's needed, even if that means packing up her racket and serving some cold, hard facts in the middle of a board meeting. Every ball Billie Jean King hits serves up a real disparity, like the fact that the average U.S. corporate board is only 12% diverse and 88% white. This has to change. And if there's one thing about Billie Jean King and e.l.f., it's that they won't stop fighting for what's right until it's game, set, match.\"\n\nLearn more at changetheboardgame.com/bjk.\n\n*Source: 2023 BoardEx Non-Executive Director Database analysis of UD publicly traded companies on NASDAQ + NYSE **Source: SSRN/ S&P 500 Global Marketing Intelligence ***As of e.l.f.

        "content": "Investors spend the extra effort to research growth stocks and construct their portfolios with the hopes of outperforming the stock market. It\u2019s possible for some growth stocks to become multibaggers for patient investors. However, these same stocks may go through sharp declines on the way to their full potential.\n\nInvestors should look for corporations that exhibit impressive financial growth, rising profit margins and competitive moats. Stocks with these three factors have a greater chance of outperforming the broader market. These three growth stocks check off those boxes and can generate high returns for long-term investors.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cybersecurity firm has an impressive recurring revenue model and continues to gain market share while most of its competitors are experiencing challenges. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) achieved 34% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in Q4 FY24 and $53.7 million in GAAP net income. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company\u2019s shift to profitability and rising margins bode well for long-term investors. CrowdStrike\u2019s $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue and good guidance suggest that growth can continue. The stock\u2019s only weakness is its lofty valuation. Investors will have to accept a 76-forward P/E ratio if they want to buy shares at current levels.\n\nThe stock looks more promising on any dips, but most analysts aren\u2019t waiting. The stock has a Strong Buy rating and a projected 33% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $435 per share suggests the stock can gain an additional 46%.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is gaining more traction in the beauty industry. It has reported 20 consecutive quarters of growth and looks poised to continue that streak. The cosmetics company gained 305 basis points of market share while delivering 85% YoY net sales growth. Net income jumped by 41% YoY.\n\nInvestors should feel encouraged about the company\u2019s updated fiscal 2024 outlook. The previous outlook suggested revenue would reach $901 million at the midpoint. However, new guidance implies $985 million at the midpoint. Guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased from the $2.47 to $2.50 range to the $2.84 to $2.87 range.\n\nThe company focuses on clean, cruelty-free and vegan products. E.l.f. Beauty got its start as an online disruptor and is now becoming mainstream. The stock has gained 24% year-to-date and has soared by 1,300% over the past five years. Analysts believe the stock has more room to run with an average price target that implies a 17% gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) has done quite well for long-term investors while offering a reasonable 19 P/E ratio. The stock has gained 27% year-to-date on its way to a 102% gain over the past five years.\n\nRevenue and profits are both on the upswing. These figures increased by 11% and 33% YoY, respectively, in Q1 2024. Revenue growth was in line with the company\u2019s multi-year plan, while net income growth was a pleasant surprise. The fintech firm plans to generate annualized 9% to 11% revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens over the next five years.\n\nThe company can achieve those long-term objectives as more Millennials and Gen Z consumers open American Express credit cards. More than 60% of the company\u2019s 3.4 million new card acquisitions came from those cohorts. American Express is a premium brand with a lower valuation than other credit and debit card giants. Profit margins are expanding, and that should be the case for multiple years based on management\u2019s long-term goals.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in ELF.

        "content": "Investors with an interest in Cosmetics stocks have likely encountered both Helen of Troy (HELE) and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\n\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.\n\nHelen of Troy and e.l.f. Beauty are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HELE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\n\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\n\nHELE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.39, while ELF has a forward P/E of 49.65. We also note that HELE has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ELF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for HELE is its P/B ratio of 1.32. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ELF has a P/B of 15.82.\n\nBased on these metrics and many more, HELE holds a Value grade of A, while ELF has a Value grade of F.\n\nHELE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ELF, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HELE is the superior option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "You don\u2019t have to do daily trades to achieve your long-term financial goals. Buying and holding reliable stocks for many years can lead to outsized returns and move you closer to retirement. Investors have to remain patient and hold onto promising corporations during good times and bad times.\n\nStock market corrections test the mettle of many investors. Some investors mistakenly sell stocks just because they are going down. There are reasons to sell stocks, such as a significant change to the company\u2019s fundamentals or growth opportunities, but a correction alone isn\u2019t enough of a reason to sell reliable companies.\n\nInvestors who can weather the storm with these long-term stocks have the potential to grow their portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) didn\u2019t receive as much love to start the year as AI blunders got overblown. The stock has rebounded and is up by 11% year-to-date.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Alphabet makes most of its revenue from advertising. While it\u2019s better to have well-diversified revenue streams, ad revenue is working well for the company. Google and YouTube helped the company achieve 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023.\n\nGoogle Cloud attributed to more than 10% of the company\u2019s revenue and looks like it can be a solid business segment for the company moving forward. Alphabet is one of the largest cloud computing providers. Google Cloud looks poised to become a larger percentage of total revenue each quarter. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see Google Cloud revenue become more than 20% of the company\u2019s total revenue within the next 1-2 years.\n\nRevenue growth has been good, but net income growth has been even better. The company reported 52% year-over-year net income growth in Q4 2023. Cost-cutting measures can support higher profit margins and make the company\u2019s 29 P/E ratio look more enticing.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2024 while attracting Millennials and Gen Z. Those two cohorts made up 60% of the company\u2019s new cardholders who came in during the first quarter.\n\nThe financial firm delivered on the high-end of its revenue guidance and surprised investors with its net income growth. Revenue grew by 11% year-over-year. It\u2019s a growth rate the firm believes it can achieve beyond 2026. Net income growth captured more attention. While the firm suggested mid-teens EPS growth beyond 2026, the firm reported 34% year-over-year net income growth in the quarter. That translated into a 39% year-over-year growth in diluted EPS.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has a reasonable 20 P/E ratio given its current financials and long-term growth prospects. People will continue to use credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express stands to benefit from that trend and is more reasonably valued than its peers.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany consumers turn to\u00a0Walmart (NYSE:WMT) when they want to save money on various products. The retailer has established a strong reputation for itself for more than 60 years. The company continues to expand and delivered 5.7% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023.\n\nWalmart has a few catalysts that can support higher growth rates and improved profit margins. The first catalyst is the rising cost of goods and services. Higher prices will entice more people to shop at Walmart to save money. The company has been making a push to attract\u00a0a higher quantity of wealthy customers.\n\nThe second catalyst is the company\u2019s advertising network. The global advertising business grew by 33% year-over-year and the acquisition of Vizio will strengthen this segment. A focus on advertising will increase profit margins and may have contributed to the company\u2019s 9% dividend hike.\n\nThe final catalyst is e-commerce growth. Global e-commerce sales grew by 23% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Full-year e-commerce sales exceeded $100 billion. The company can exhibit better top and bottom lines as e-commerce revenue makes up a larger percentage of total revenue.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is in the middle of a deep correction that has made the stock more attractive for long-term investors. Shares are down by more than 25% from their all-time highs and currently trade at a 70 P/E ratio.\n\nThe beauty firm has a high valuation because of its impressive financial growth. Elf Beauty continued the trend with 85% year-over-year net sales growth in\u00a0Q3 FY24. The company significantly raised its fiscal 2024 outlook. The company hiked its net sales range from $896-$906 million to $980-$990 million. Net income came in at $26.9 million on a GAAP basis which is up by 41% year-over-year.\n\nElf Beauty has achieved 20 consecutive quarters of sales growth. Those results have helped the stock surge by more than 1,100% over the past five years. Analysts are feeling bullish on the stock and have rated it as a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d The average price target suggests a\u00a031% upside from current levels.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market\u2019s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCostco (NASDAQ:COST) has established itself as a wholesaler that offers affordable prices for various products. The recent monthly sales report indicates the corporation is doing well. The company generated a 7.7% year-over-year comparable sales growth rate in the retail month of March. The company also reported 5.2% year-over-year growth over the past 31 weeks.\n\nE-commerce growth also came in hot at 28.3% year-over-year for the retail month of March. The \u201cretail month of March\u201d is the five weeks ended April 7, 2024. Costco has steadily outperformed the stock market with a 189% gain over the past five years. The corporation trades at a 46 P/E ratio and offers a 0.655 dividend yield.\n\nCostco makes it possible to do all of your shopping in one place, and that advantage has resulted in plenty of bullishness from analysts. The stock is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d with an average price target that suggests an\u00a011% upside.\n\nFICO (FICO) hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/CC7\n\nFICO (NYSE:FICO) measures credit risk and is the golden standard for credit scores. Many financial institutions use FICO scores to assess a consumer\u2019s level of risk before giving out loans.\n\nThe company has two business segments that both grew year-over-year in the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024. Scores revenue increased by 8% year-over-year. This segment includes the company\u2019s B2B scoring solutions and B2C solutions.\n\nSoftware revenues jumped by 14% year-over-year. This segment consists of the company\u2019s analytics and digital decisioning technology. Annual recurring revenue grew by 43% year-over-year.\n\nOverall revenue increased by 11% year-over-year, but net income growth was more impressive. Earnings were 24% higher compared to the same time year-over-year and resulted in a 31.7% net profit margin. The stock has handily outperformed the market with a 300% gain over the past five years. The stock is rated as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d and has a\u00a0projected 20% upside from current levels.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) has been a roller coaster for long-term investors. The stock is down by 25% year-to-date and has dropped by 31% over the past five years. However, the company is up by 18% over the past year and has a projected 24% upside from current levels.\n\nThe digital bank offers many services you would expect from traditional banks. The fintech firm offers bank accounts, loans, credit cards, investment accounts, and other resources. It\u2019s an all-in-one resource for people who want to manage their finances in one place.\n\nA good platform isn\u2019t enough to justify buying the stock. However, SoFi recently switched to profitability and has a compelling long-term outlook. The firm grew its revenue by 35% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023 while reporting $47.9 million in GAAP net income. That\u2019s a big shift compared to the $40.0 million GAAP net loss posted in Q4 2022.\n\nSoFi expects 20%-25% compound revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects to generate $0.55 to $0.80 in GAAP earnings per share in 2026. The firm also expects 20%-25% compounded EPS growth beyond 2026.\n\nThe stock currently trades at roughly $7/share. A $0.55 EPS implies a 12.7 P/E ratio while an $0.80 EPS suggests an 8.75 P/E ratio. We have to wait until 2026 to see if guidance plays out as expected. However, the company\u2019s long-term goals and recent financial growth highlight a stock with great potential.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, ELF, and SOFI.

        "content": "Investors accumulate growth stocks with the hopes of outperforming the stock market. Some of these investments produce substantial returns for patient investors, but the key is sticking with successful corporations over the long run.\n\nSome investors sell their shares too early and miss out on significant gains. While it makes sense to sell shares in some instances, a few bad days during a broader stock market correction is rarely a good reason to sell shares.\n\nSome growth stocks have the potential to double in the next 12 months. It\u2019s hard to predict these stocks, and investors should only buy shares if they believe the corporations can perform at high levels for multiple years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, these three growth stocks can potentially generate outsized returns for investors.\n\nSoFi (SOFI) SoFi logo sign on headquarters facade. Social Finance is an online personal finance company.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is finally hitting its stride. The stock is down by 26% year-to-date but has reported solid financials that indicate a rebound is due. Q4 2023 net income came in at $48 million compared to a net loss in the same period last year. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year. Total memberships grew by 44% year-over-year. SoFi now has more than 7.5 million members on its platform.\n\nThe fintech company offers bank accounts, investment accounts, loans, credit cards and other financial products. The company can offer more competitive rates and terms than traditional banks since it doesn\u2019t have as much overhead. Profit margins came in at 8% for the quarter, and SoFi can expand its margins quickly.\n\nSoFi\u2019s leadership has established an encouraging multi-year plan that suggests compound revenue growth of 20% to 25% beyond 2026. The fintech company anticipates 20% to 25% EPS growth beyond 2026. SoFi expects EPS to range from $0.55 to $0.80 per share in 2026, which suggests a reasonable price point for current investors.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is doing everything right from a growth perspective. Revenue increased by 95% year-over-year in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023\u00a0as the company\u2019s sports beverages continued to fly off the shelves. Net income came to $39.1 million for the quarter compared to a $28.2 million net loss in the same period last year.\n\nCelsius Holdings\u2019 efforts to expand globally stand to improve the stock. North America generated $332.8 million of the company\u2019s $347.4 million in total Q4 revenue. The company will\u00a0expand in Australia and New Zealand in Q4 2024. The company\u2019s sports drinks will be available in the United Kingdom and Ireland in Q2 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese developments can keep revenue and earnings growth elevated. The stock will need those two components to keep up with a\u00a062-forward P/E ratio. Celsius Holdings trades at a $16 billion market cap and exhibits impressive revenue and earnings growth. It can double within a few years, if not within the next 12 months.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cosmetics firm has attracted plenty of attention thanks to its 1,100% gain over the past five years.\u00a0Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is still ahead of the market with a 12% year-to-date gain but is in the middle of a correction. The stock has dropped by roughly 30% from its all-time high as concerns from other beauty brands suggest Elf Beauty may disappoint investors in its earnings report.\n\nHowever, Elf Beauty has a history of outperforming its peers and can repeat that process in its next earnings report. The company\u2019s previous earnings report revealed\u00a0Q3 FY24 results. Revenue surged by 85% year-over-year, which gave the company its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth. Net income increased by 41% year-over-year.\n\nElf Beauty gained 305 basis points of market share during the quarter. Analysts feel confident about the stock and have rated it as a \u201cModerate Buy.\u201d The\u00a0average price target suggests a 31% upside from current levels.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SOFI, CELH and ELF.

        "title": "3 Beauty Stocks to Buy on Ulta\u2019s Guidance Warning",
        "content": "Cosmetic retail firm Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) recently delivered quite the shocker when its CEO said that beauty demand was slowing \u201ca bit earlier and a bit bigger than we thought.\u201d Undoubtedly, the commentary sent shares of ULTA nosediving by around 15%. At writing, ULTA stock has shed more than a quarter of its value from its peak levels. The Ultra guidance warning shockwave swept through the broader beauty industry, with some high-flying beauty stocks also taking sizeable hits to the chin, falling in sympathy with the $20 billion beauty titan.\n\nUndoubtedly, some of the beauty stocks have enjoyed sizeable runs in recent years, and with that, it\u2019s hard not to imagine the expectations bar creeping higher. With such extended valuations amid the market rally, it\u2019s not a mystery why Ulta\u2019s perception of the industry has weighed so heavily on the broader basket of beauty plays.\n\nThe big question is whether a shift in industry trends is solely to blame or if Ulta is being bettered by its rivals. Let\u2019s check in on three beauty stocks that may be worth buying on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF)\n\nSource: elf Cosmetics\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NASDAQ:ELF) has been the most exciting beauty stock to hang onto in recent years. Even after the latest 25% spill, ELF stock is still up 64% over the past year and over 500% in the past two years. Of course, there have been occasional scares en route to higher levels. Last August, the stock lost a third of its value before recovering in record time to hit new highs.\n\nEven as the beauty industry stalls, there\u2019s no doubt that e.l.f. Beauty has been a colossal market share taker, and the company can continue gaining share. Even as the cosmetics market hits a few road bumps, I\u2019d argue, e.l.f. Beauty may be in an even better spot to take more share as consumers seek to spend less.\n\nThe $8.7 billion cosmetics retailer offers competitive prices, decent quality, and, perhaps most importantly, a high degree of innovation. TD Cowen analysts remain upbeat on ELF stock amid recent turbulence, also remarking on the firm\u2019s ability to innovate. I think they\u2019re smart to stay bullish on the name.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al (LRLCF) A photograph of a L'Or\u00e9al retail storefront.\n\nSource: PippiLongstocking / Shutterstock.com\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al (OTCMKTS:LRLCF) stock spiked higher following the release of some pretty impressive first-quarter earnings results. Most of its product categories saw impressive strength across the board. Most notably, the company\u2019s Dermatological Beauty segment experiences almost 22% gains for the quarter. There seem to be few, if any, signs of beauty industry softness, according to L\u2019Or\u00e9al thus far.\n\nStory continues\n\nPersonally, I think the recent weakness from Ulta is more of a company-specific matter than an industry one. Either way, I expect the broader basket of beauty stocks could grow L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s fantastic number as they rise from oversold conditions.\n\nAs for LRLCF stock itself, it\u2019s less than 7% from all-time highs, which may very well be reached following its applaud-worthy numbers, which, I believe, should act as a breath of fresh air for the broader cosmetics industry.\n\nCoty (COTY) The Coty (COTY) logo on a glass office in Poland.\n\nSource: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, we have Coty (NYSE:COTY), which I view as one of the best value options for the beauty market, with shares currently trading at 19.6 times forward price-to-earnings. Apart from the modest multiple, Coty has been praised by several big-name analysts in recent weeks.\n\nTD Cowen upgraded its rating on COTY stock to outperform with a 23% price target hike. As a part of the upgrade, analysts pointed to the firm\u2019s fragrance business as a \u201crobust category in the U.S.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, the luxury fragrance market has been a big mood booster during the pandemic and now through rampant inflation. Many young consumers, like those in the Gen Z cohort, view fragrances as another means of expressing their unique personalities with signature scents (or even sizeable fragrance collections). Further, widely followed social-media influencers within the scent community, like Jeremy Fragrance, have been an absolute boon to the smell-good industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nJoey Frenette is a seasoned investment writer specializing in technology and consumer stocks.

These stocks are more vulnerable to price swings due to macroeconomic factors. These growth stocks to buy now are also held under the microscope each time they report earnings.\n\nInvestors pay more attention to these types of stocks because of the potential payoff. Some growth stocks have become giants within their respective industries while others have the potential to become giants.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why investors buy growth stocks. They want to outperform the stock market. These seven growth stocks to buy now can give you a chance at achieving that objective.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers the world\u2019s most recognizable online marketplace that lists millions of products on its platform. The company processes more than 4,000 product sales every minute.\n\nThe e-commerce segment is Amazon\u2019s main revenue driver, but the company is also seeing plenty of success with its leading cloud computing division. Amazon Web Services has the\u00a0lion\u2019s share of the cloud computing industry. It has roughly one-third of the total market share and has a big lead over the competition. It\u2019s mostly a duopoly between Amazon and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an honorable mention.\n\nThe tech giant is also expanding its advertising, video streaming, and grocery segments. Amazon recently got accused of\u00a0attempting to steal Trader Joe\u2019s trade secrets. This isn\u2019t the best look for Amazon, but investors should take note that the company is looking to expand its grocery store footprint through Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. Advertising and streaming are the bigger segments to monitor, but Amazon seems to be putting more effort into its grocery segment. This makes it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSofi (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nTraditional bank stocks aren\u2019t considered growth stocks. Those corporations have matured and offer dividend payouts to keep shareholders invested. However, SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) isn\u2019t your traditional bank.\n\nThe fintech company operates entirely online, so you can\u2019t drive to a local branch. The company also has many of the\u00a0financial products you would expect from a big institution. Consumers can get personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, and other products. SoFi has also made great strides in getting mainstream appeal through SoFi Stadium and by becoming the official bank of the NBA.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi reported its first profitable quarter in\u00a0Q4 2023. Net income came to $47.9 million while revenue was $615.4 million. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year and the company ended up with a 7.9% net profit margin. This helps make it one of those growth stocks to buy now.\n\nSoFi\u2019s P/E ratio can drop quickly and present value to patient investors. However, you will have to contend with a stock that has dropped by 31% over the past five years and is also down by 25% year-to-date. Rising profits can catch a lot of investors by surprise and potentially result in a surge.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is gaining market share in the beauty industry and has generated significant returns for investors.

Revenue increased by 85% year-over-year in\u00a0Q3 FY24 while net income jumped by 41% year-over-year to reach $26.9 million. The company has double-digit net profit margins.\n\nELF investors got spooked after\u00a0Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) warned investors of a slower quarter. However, that may not be bad news for Elf Beauty. The company can be using this opportunity to gain market share while another competitor isn\u2019t doing as well. It\u2019s possible that Elf Beauty is still performing well despite Ulta Beauty\u2019s warning. This is a case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat leading up to Elf Beauty\u2019s earnings report. We\u2019ll learn more about the company\u2019s performance when that report comes out.

Cintas\u2019 profit margins are expanding, and the company still has growth opportunities.\n\nCintas provides business supplies and safety equipment for more than one million businesses in North America. The company\u2019s revenue is well-diversified due to the large customer base, but Cintas can continue to reach additional businesses in North America.\n\nThe company hiked its annual revenue exceptions from a range of $9.48 to $9.56 billion to $9.57 billion to $9.60 billion after the latest earnings report. Higher revenue and diluted EPS expectations have investors excited and spell out a promising long-term opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is up by 44% year-to-date and many analysts believe that the stock can march higher. The social media giant has a projected 9% upside from its current price. Meta Platforms is rated as a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d among 43 analysts. The highest price target of $600 per share suggests a potential 20% gain.\n\nThe company continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while delivering substantial profit margin expansion. Revenue jumped by 25% year-over-year in\u00a0Q4 2023 while net income more than tripled compared to the same period last year.\n\nMore people continue to create accounts for Meta Platforms\u2019 family of apps. Family daily active users increased by 8% year-over-year while monthly active users jumped by 6% year-over-year. Instagram and WhatsApp are delivering higher growth rates than Facebook.\n\nThe corporation is committed to increasing shareholder value based on its $20.03 billion stock buyback in full-year 2023.

        "content": "Consumer stocks to buy now aren\u2019t just a fleeting trend. As the second quarter (Q2) rolls in, consumer stocks present themselves as excellent bets, offering the dual benefit of steady portfolio growth and attractive shareholder rewards.\n\nMoreover, we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters how the U.S. continues to exhibit robust signs of growth, outperforming analyst estimates. The robust consumer spending environment leads to higher profits and a more stable economic landscape. Despite the possibility of prolonged inflationary pressures, the resilience of the U.S. economy shines through. Its enduring strength underscores why consumer stocks remain compelling for those seeking security and growth amidst the market uncertainty. That said, here are three consumer stocks to buy now that embody the earlier discussion.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is one of the leading cosmetics businesses, thriving on the back of its unique blend of clean and vegan products with a remarkably affordable price point. It effectively caters to Gen Z\u2019s preferences, with its brand having established a dominant online and social media footprint. Its innovative approach has positioned it as one of the top growth stocks in its niche, with its stock gaining an eye-watering 475% in the past three years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking ahead, its financial outlook remains exceptionally bright. It kicked into gear during the pandemic, delivering double-digit top-line growth, and has continued the momentum since then. Not only has it delivered double-digit sales growth in the past consecutive quarters, but it has also outperformed analyst estimates across both lines.\n\nIn the third quarter, its net sales surged 85% year-over-year (YOY) to $270.9 million while besting analyst estimates of $32 million. This momentum is projected to continue, with the company expecting net sales for the year to fall in the $980 million and $990 million range, marking an impressive increase of 69% to 71% compared to the prior year. Moreover, according to TipRanks analysts, ELF stock is a \u2018moderate buy\u2019\u00a0offering a healthy 28% upside from current price levels.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.\n\nSource: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce giant that\u2019s flown under the radar in the past few years. Like its peers, the company has weathered its fair share of headwinds alongside the struggling Chinese economy. Current market conditions are far from conducive, but the company remains agile and has multiple long-term growth catalysts, which makes it an attractive bet. Additionally, BABA stock trades at just a forward 1.30 times trailing-twelve-month-sales (TTM), 69% lower than the sector median.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt boasts a massive cash reserve exceeding $91.6 billion, which positions it incredibly well to navigate economic turbulence. Its financial robustness allows the tech giant to push forward with aplomb and undertake potentially risky ventures without the pressure of external financing.\n\nFurthermore, the company continues to refine its core operations and revenue strategies through Taobao and Tmall while actively expanding into burgeoning markets and new business areas. Moreover, new segments, such as the Digital Commerce group and the Cainiao logistics arm, delivered 44% and 27% YOY growth, respectively, in its most recent quarter. Its move into digital commerce and logistics is particularly strategic, as it efficiently taps into the rapid e-commerce adoption across high-growth regions, including Southeast Asia and Latin America.\n\nIngredion (INGR) Ingredion Canada Inc head office in Brampton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIngredion (NYSE:INGR) manufactures diverse ingredient solutions catering to various sectors, from food to textiles. Over the years, it has operated a business that\u2019s exhibited consistent growth across both lines. This growth has been mirrored by its stock, which has gained over 21% in the past three years. However, its excellent dividend profile helps INGR\u2019s stock stand out. It yields a tremendous 2.83% while growing its payouts in the past 13 years, beating the sector median of two years.\n\nWhile top-line growth in recent quarters has been uninspiring due to multiple headwinds, the company has efficiently maintained its solid profitability profile. For instance,\u00a0its free cash flow margin of 6.40% beats the sector median by 30%, while its return on common equity is an eye-catching 20%.\n\nGiven the company\u2019s role in multiple growing market segments, I expect INGR stock to bounce back in a more conducive business environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\u00a0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\u00a0Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\n\nThe sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.\n\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\n\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for e.l.f. Beauty basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\n\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\n\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\n\nFor e.l.f. Beauty, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\n\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\n\nStory continues\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nThis cosmetics company is expected to earn $3.05 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 83.7%.\n\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for e.l.f. Beauty. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 13.9%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\n\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\n\nThe upgrade of e.l.f. Beauty to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about e.l.f. Beauty (ELF).\n\ne.l.f. Beauty currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for e.l.f. Beauty here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying e.l.f. Beauty, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs ELF a Good Investment?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for e.l.f. Beauty, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $3.05.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for e.l.f. Beauty. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for e.l.f. Beauty may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "3 Top Growth Stocks That Could Run Circles Around the Market in 2024",
        "content": "One of the best ways to build lasting wealth is by investing in growing companies and holding onto those shares for many years. While it's difficult to know how a stock will perform in any given year, identifying companies with great long-term prospects that are also showing improving financial results in the near term can boost your odds of finding timely buys.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors were recently asked to select three stocks that they think could outperform the major indexes this year. Here's why they chose e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF), Revolve Group(NYSE: RVLV), and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG).\n\ne.l.f. could become the top beauty brand in the world one day\n\nJohn Ballard (e.l.f. Beauty): Shares of this cosmetics brand have exploded, climbing 500% over the last three years. E.l.f. Beauty reported accelerating sales growth last year, driven by an effective distribution strategy with major retailers like Target. But the shares recently dipped, which makes this a great time to buy, as the company is in the early stages of expanding globally.\n\nSales grew an impressive 85% year over year in its most recently reported quarter. It is now the No. 3 brand in the U.S. cosmetics category.\n\nImportantly, e.l.f. Beauty's success in expanding into areas such as skin care shows a brand that is gaining tremendous consumer awareness. These results stem from its focus on offering quality products at value prices and topping it off with great marketing.\n\nThe company is also showing massive international growth potential. Over the last five years, its international sales have grown at a 37% annualized rate, and that growth rate accelerated to 113% last year.\n\nThe stock's valuation is expensive, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 74.5, but I believe it's worth paying up for. Indeed, its forward P/E ratio of 48 looks fairly reasonable based on Wall Street's long-term earnings growth forecast of 35% per year. Investors should expect e.l.f. Beauty stock to outperform the major indexes in 2024 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe future of fashion\n\nJennifer Saibil (Revolve Group): Like pretty much every sector, the apparel industry is moving toward greater use of digital channels and artificial intelligence (AI), and Revolve Group is leading the change. Revolve runs two luxury women's wear websites, Revolve and FWRD, and its differentiated model -- driven by AI -- is resonating with its loyal and growing customer base.\n\nRevolve uses AI throughout its business for merchandise selection, but it goes deeper than that. It has been in the fashion business for 20 years, and it has a deep trove of data that it uses to design and produce the styles its customers want. Since it's all online, it's not saddled with the costs or timeframe of getting its apparel into physical stores -- it can put its designs online and start getting them out to shoppers as soon as they're manufactured. Last year, it created the first-ever AI billboard campaign, and it uses AI in marketing, events, and operations.\n\nBeyond its AI efforts, it has an innovative marketing model. It works through celebrity and influencer affiliate marketing, and it has design collaborations and capsule collections with its celebrity partners. It reaches its millennial and Gen Z target customers where they are online, and it hosts physical events and parties to deepen its relationships.\n\nIn general, Revolve's strategy of purveying luxury goods to mass-market consumers has led to high sales growth. However, these core customers are pulling back on their discretionary spending right now. Revolve's revenue declined 1% year over year in the fourth quarter, and net income was down 56%.\n\nThe customer metrics, though, tell another side of the story. Active customers increased by 9% year over year, and total orders placed increased by 5%. Average order value decreased by 2%, which makes sense -- shoppers still love Revolve, but they're spending less.\n\nThat's a great indication of Revolve's potential when the economy shapes up. Its marketing strategy is working, and Revolve is well-positioned to climb higher as it provides its customers with products they love.\n\nA fast-casual star with a twist\n\nJeremy Bowman (Sweetgreen): Sweetgreen has had a rough time since its initial public offering, but investors finally seem to be recognizing the opportunity in the fast-casual restaurant disruptor.\n\nThe stock has already doubled this year following a strong fourth-quarter earnings report that featured 29% revenue growth to $153 million and an average unit volume of $2.9 million, which is comparable to Chipotle Mexican Grill, the leader in the fast-casual segment.\n\nBased on its concept alone, Sweetgreen is a promising growth story. It's pioneering a new category as a fast-casual salad chain, and its high average unit volume shows clearly that the demand is there for its offerings.\n\nHowever, there's another reason why Sweetgreen could keep climbing this year and run circles around the stock market.\n\nThe company has begun rolling out a technology it calls \"Infinite Kitchen\" -- essentially, a robotic salad assembly platform that speeds up order prep and throughput, and cuts down on labor expenses.\n\nAfter opening two restaurants with its robot kitchens, Sweetgreen plans to open seven to nine locations this year and retrofit two to four others. That's a significant acceleration of the platform.\n\nIf it delivers the kind of results the company has projected, it could be a game-changer for Sweetgreen, which would likely be a much more valuable company if it could drive profitability in addition to revenue growth and high average unit volumes.\n\nIt may take a few quarters, but investors seem prepared to reward the stock for good news based on its jump after the fourth-quarter earnings report, and Sweetgreen stock is still down 57% from its post-IPO peak.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in e.l.f.

What\u2019s more, they are reasonably valued at a forward EV/Sales below 10.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis build-it-yourself video game platform has proved to be a hit among users. Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) had another healthy year, growing revenues by 26% in 2023. Bookings were $3.5 billion, increasing 23% year-over-year (YOY).\n\nIndeed, 2023 results revealed the company\u2019s excellent user growth. Daily active users hit 68.4 million for the full year, growing 22% year-over-year. Also, average monthly unique payers rose 17% to 14.5 million.\n\nEven better, Roblox grew its 13-and-over DAUs by 28% in Q4 2023. Now, over 58% of DAUs are in this category, which is a positive for the advertising business the company is trying to ramp up. Additionally, the company ended Q4 2023 with the strongest quarterly bookings growth.\n\nAlso, Roblox is an under-the-radar AI opportunity. It announced Roblox Assistant, which allows users to generate ideas using natural language text prompts. On the operations front, they are using AI to lower costs and improve safety on the platform.\n\nFurthermore, Roblox is one of the top growth stocks to buy at 6 times forward EV/Sales.

Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is disrupting the cosmetics industry and taking share as it does so. Its core value proposition is offering clean, vegan and cruelty-free cosmetics at a lower price point. Indeed, while the average prices for legacy and prestige brands are $9 and $20, respectively, its products cost about $6.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering this value proposition, it\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s a top brand among teens. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s 47th Semi-Annual Taking Stock With Teens, released on April 9, the brand is number 1. e.l.f. Beauty dominates the category and grew market share by 16 points YOY to 38%.\n\nSo, these market share gains have translated into impressive revenue growth numbers for the cosmetic brand. On February 6, it reported Q3 fiscal year 2024 results, delivering 85% growth. Even better, it gained 305 basis points in market share. Therefore, this was the 20th quarter in a row of revenues and market share growth.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is one of the best growth stocks to buy today. Its innovative engine has produced the number one or two positioned brands across 16 categories in color cosmetics. After Ulta Beauty\u2019s (NASDAQ:ULTA) negative commentary, ELF stock declined to $170. This selloff is an opportunity as e.l.f. Beauty remains the most productive brand at Ulta Beauty, Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nTransMedics (TMDX) Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients.

TransMedics (NASDAQ:TMDX) Organ Care System is a portable organ perfusion system that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2021. The system replicates the physiologic conditions for donor organs outside the human body and is approved for lungs, hearts and livers.\n\nIts National OCS Program (NOP) comprises approximately 200 surgical and clinical personnel in hubs in the U.S., supporting access and delivery of donor organs. Furthermore, the company has built a dedicated fleet of modern jets to ease access to distant donors. Notably, most transplant centers are opting for the service instead of their teams due to better clinical outcomes and lower costs.\n\nBecause of the company\u2019s technology, there was a 12% increase in heart and liver transplantation last year. For instance, Tufts Medical Center performed a record 61 adult heart transplants in 2023, attributing the success to TransMedics. As a result, revenues are soaring and 2024 could be another year of outperformance.\n\nIn 2023, revenues were $241.6 million, representing 159% growth from 2022. Q4 2023 was the eighth quarter of sequential growth. Management\u2019s outlook of $360 million to $370 million for 2024 predicts 49% to 53% growth.

However, you may want to consider buying at least one of these seven top stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has entered a sharp correction ever since its competitor Ulta Beauty (NYSE:ULTA) warned investors about a slower beauty market. The recent pullback has resulted in a 46-forward P/E ratio for the cosmetics company.\n\nWhile some investors may feel nervous about the valuation, the reaction to Ulta news is overdone. The two beauty companies are in different leagues when it comes to growth rates. Ulta\u2019s revenue growth hovers at around 10% year-over-year. Meanwhile, Elf Beauty reported an 85% year-over-year increase in net sales and gained 305 basis points of market share in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nElf Beauty has been maintaining 80% year-over-year revenue growth for several quarters while delivering impressive net income growth as well. The company also raised its fiscal 2024 outlook and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nAnalysts have rated the stock as a \u201cModerate Buy\u201d with a projected 30% upside. The stock has already been up by 92% over the past year. The correction presents a long-term buying opportunity, and it\u2019s possible for Elf Beauty to gain market share while others in the industry report slower sales. The second stock on this list follows that trend.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) An image of a hacker on a laptop with icons of messages and data behind him\n\nSource: jossnat / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow at a solid rate while competitors are slamming the brakes and announcing lukewarm guidance. Crowdstrike previously declined in solidarity with other cybersecurity stocks as they reported unfavorable guidance. Investors had a change of heart after Crowdstrike reported a strong earnings report for Q4 FY24.\n\nRevenue grew by 33% year-over-year to reach $845.3 million. The company also has $3.44 billion in annual recurring revenue which serves as a good baseline. It\u2019s getting easier for hackers to threaten companies. They can use artificial intelligence to brute force their way into unprotected databases. These tools are getting more advanced, and the Crowdstrike Falcon Platform offers good protection from cyberattacks. This makes it one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike has always delivered impressive revenue growth, but the company\u2019s rising profit margins are also stirring up excitement. The company reported $53.7 million in GAAP net income compared to a $47.5 million GAAP net loss in the same period last year. The stock has gained 392% over the past five years.\n\nSemrush (SEMR) Writing note showing Content Marketing. Business photo showcasing involves creation and sharing of online material.\n\nSource: Artur Szczybylo via Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps businesses identify promising keywords. The first page of Google is prime real estate for online and local businesses. Those placements result in more website visitors who can turn into leads.\n\nCompetition in the industry is fierce, and Semrush gives many business owners the resources they need to succeed. Semrush is more than just keyword research. You can conduct detailed competitor analyses and discover opportunities to grow your business.\n\nThe stock has been bumpy since its IPO but is getting into the swing with a 31% gain over the past year. The company recently became profitable and reported an 8.5% net profit margin in\u00a0Q4 2023. That quarter also featured a 21% year-over-year revenue increase. Full-year net income came in at $1.0 million while the company generated $6.9 million in Q4 2023 net income.\n\nSemrush has approximately 108,000 paying customers which is a 12.5% year-over-year improvement. This broad customer pool can insulate the business from sharp revenue declines. Furthermore, some of the company\u2019s paying customers may upgrade their plans to access additional features.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a group of people eating fast food, including cheeseburgers and fries\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is gaining market share in the fast food industry and continues to generate double-digit growth rates for its top and bottom lines. The fourth quarter of 2023 featured 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth and 26.1% year-over-year net income growth. Chipotle\u2019s net profit margin increased to 11.2%.\n\nThe company opened 121 restaurants in Q4 2023 and 271 new restaurants in the full year. Most of these restaurants include Chipotlanes, which allows the company to serve more customers. Chipotle has plans to open 285-315 restaurants in 2024 which is a 10.7% year-over-year improvement at the midpoint.\n\nChipotle stock will go through a\u00a050-for-1 stock split in June. The stock split will make shares more accessible and increase options trading volume. The stock has done a fine job of outperforming the stock market before its upcoming split. Shares are up by 308% over the past five years. It\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image on the Amazon logo on a phone, held in front of a stock chart to represent Amazon stock\n\nSource: Daniel Fung / Shutterstock\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to win support from Wall Street analysts. Cloud computing, online marketplace sales, advertising, and video streaming are some of the catalysts that are prompting higher price targets.\n\nThe stock currently has a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d rating and an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. Amazon only has Buy ratings from its 41 analysts. The highest price target of $230 per share suggests that the stock can rally by an additional 24%.\n\nAmazon is growing in multiple industries and recently reported its highest-ever revenue. Net sales increased by 14% year-over-year to reach $170 billion in\u00a0Q4 2023. North American and international sales accelerated in the fourth quarter, while Amazon Web Services revenue growth stayed in line for Q4 2023 compared to full-year 2023. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nThe segment had a 13% year-over-year growth rate for both time periods. Advertising services did even better with 27% year-over-year revenue growth.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has outperformed the stock market with a 146% gain over the past year. Shares are also off to a hot start with a 52% year-to-date gain and come with a 34 P/E ratio.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to expanding profit margins can result in a more enticing valuation in the future. Meta Platforms more than tripled its net income in the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue was 25% higher in the quarter compared to the same time last year.\n\nMeta Platforms don\u2019t only have good growth rates. It also has a healthy balance sheet. The social media firm has $65.40 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. On the other hand, it only has $18.39 billion in long-term debt. Meta Platforms reduced its headcount by 22% year-over-year to facilitate its profit margin expansion.\n\nMETA stock has now become a dividend growth play as the company recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. The company will probably maintain an annualized growth rate above 10% for many years.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthy sports beverages that does not have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup, sugar, or gluten. The drink also contains essential vitamins and plenty of caffeine.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the stock and have rated it as a \u201cStrong Buy.\u201d The stock has a projected 11% upside at the average price target. The highest price target of $110 per share implies that shares can rally by an additional 31% from current levels.\n\nThe company is growing at a fast rate and is gaining market share from its competitors. Celsius Holdings reported 95% year-over-year revenue growth in\u00a0Q4 2023. The sports beverage company generated $322.8 million of its $347.4 million in North America. International revenue grew by 68% year-over-year and is still in its early innings.\n\nThe company is on the verge of tapping into Australian and New Zealand markets. The beverages will reach the continent in\u00a0Q4 2024. Domestic sales remain elevated, and international traction can lead to high revenue growth for several years. The company has maintained double-digit profit margins while generating substantial top-line growth rates. All in all, it\u2019s one of those top stocks to buy.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, AMZN, and CELH.

Today, we are looking at personal care stocks, starting with Herbalife (NYSE:HLF).\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 13.4% below consensus.

It was a mixed quarter for the company, with a beat of analysts'\u00a0organic revenue growth expectations, driven by outperformance in its Asia and North America segments. On the other hand, its operating margin and EPS missed Wall Street's estimates.\n\n\u201cWe continue to modernize Herbalife with a sharp focus on top-line growth and margin expansion for 2024,\u201d said Michael Johnson, Chairman and CEO.\n\nStory continues Herbalife Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 24.7% since the results and currently trades at $8.85.\n\nRead our full report on Herbalife here, it's free.\n\nBest Q4: The Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST)\n\nCo-founded by actress Jessica Alba, The Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST) sells diapers and wipes, skin care products, and household cleaning products.\n\nThe Honest Company reported revenues of $90.26 million, up 10.3% year on year, outperforming analyst expectations by 7.3%.

        "title": "Sephora, Ulta, and E.l.f. among the top beauty brands for US teens, per survey",
        "content": "Teens are crazy about cosmetics.\n\nScroll through TikTok, and you'll find Gen Zs (and Gen Alphas) sharing skincare routines, makeup tutorials, go-to fragrances, and hairdo how-tos.\n\nIn a new survey from Piper Sandler, Taking Stock With Teens, teens' overall \"self-reported\" spending was down 6% year over year to $2,263 \u2014 but they didn't hold back on beauty products.\n\nAnnual spending on beauty is up 8% to $339, the highest level since 2018, with make up holding the highest share, but fragrance seeing the most growth.\n\nThe young fashionistas are giving some beauty companies a boost. Sephora (MC.PA) and Ulta (ULTA) are the top beauty retailers for teens, at 37% and 31%, respectively. Target (TGT) clocks in at No. 3, with 10% listing it as their favorite.\n\nOther retailers that teens favor for cosmetics include Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), SHEIN, e.l.f. Beauty (ELF), and CVS (CVS).\n\nAfter Ulta reported its Q4 earnings in March, CEO David Kimbell said on an analyst call that young shoppers are interested in a spectrum of beauty products.\n\n\"Young consumers are engaged in mass [beauty], but they're also engaged in prestige [brands],\" he said. \"It's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily, as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media.\"\n\nThe increased sales from teens come as consumers pull back on overall beauty spending. Kimbell said at a conference last week that Ulta is seeing a slowdown across \"price points and segments.\"\n\nOverall, growth for US mass beauty brands is slowing, with sales increasing 3-4% year over year in Q1, compared to the 7% jump in Q4.\n\nUlta expects net sales of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion for 2024, up 4% to 5% from fiscal 2023, with an operating margin of 14.0% to 14.3%, down from 15% last year.\n\nIts stock has dropped 17% in the past month, after the soft outlook and comments about the slowdown.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Competitive intensity is definitely high, largely from Kohl's Sephora shop growth, and ULTA\u2019s 2024 guidance implicitly bakes in some level of market share inflection, adding an element of risk,\" added Evercore ISI analyst Michael Binetti wrote in a note to clients.

(Photo by Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images for Huda Beauty) (Cedric Ribeiro via Getty Images)\n\nWhen it comes to products, E.l.f. Beauty is the teen favorite with 38% of the votes, up 16 points compared to last spring.\n\nPer J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira, the 20-year brand is only getting started. \"There is plenty of runaway as [a] disruptor of a large category, with nimble and fast execution,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nIts secret? The company has capitalized on social media, first as an early adopter of Facebook, then TikTok, with significant presence on Instagram, Twitch and Roblox. Its digital sales made up 24% of revenue last quarter.\n\nYet, e.l.f. Beauty shares are also under pressure, down 12% in the past month. Jefferies analyst Ashley Helgans said now is the time to buy, alluding the recent stock pullback was \"driven by ULTA's commentary around a category slowdown,\" adding that \"demand remains robust\" for e.l.f. Beauty.\n\nSelena Gomez's Rare Beauty is a distant second, with 9% of teens pegging it as their favorite. Others in the top 10 include Maybelline, Charlotte Rilbury, and Rihanna's Fenty.\n\nFragrance makers are in luck. Nearly three-quarters of female teens said they use a perfume every day, up from last years' 66%.\n\nTheir favorite brand is Bath and Body Works (BBWI), with 29% of the votes, while L'Occitane Group's Sol de Janiero brand and Victoria's Secret (VSCO) took second and third, with 17% and 11%, respectively.\n\nBath and Body Works shares are up nearly 7% year-to-date, but underperform the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% gain. For fiscal 2024, the company is projecting flat to 3% decline in net sales, with a 2.5% to 4% year over year revenue drop in Q1.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Savyata Mishra\n\n(Reuters) -Shares of Ulta Beauty tumbled as much as 14.5% on Wednesday after executives flagged a slowdown in demand across categories in the first quarter and stiff competition, weighing on peers elf Beauty, Coty and Estee Lauder.\n\nThe beauty retailer now anticipates its total category to increase at a moderate mid single-digit range after years of strong growth.\n\n\"What we've seen so far is a slowdown in the total category across price points and segments. That's a bit earlier and a bit bigger than we thought,\" Ulta Beauty CEO David Kimbell told J.P. Morgan analysts during a fireside chat.\n\nShares of the company were headed for their worst day since May 26, 2023. Elf Beauty shares fell as much as 12.2%, tracking their worst day since May 2020. Coty and Estee Lauder both dropped about 5%.\n\n\"The competitive environment is intense, and we're feeling it particularly in a couple of areas. We lost share in prestige makeup. We've been challenged in haircare,\" Kimbell said.\n\nResilient demand for luxury makeup brands such as MAC Cosmetics, Clinique and Anastasia Beverly Hills as well as premium fragrances had lifted sales at Ulta in the last three years.\n\n\"We believe the decline in shares reflects uncertainty rather than a more tangible understanding of earnings downside,\" William Blair analyst Dylan Carden wrote in a note.\n\nUlta last month forecast annual profit below Wall Street estimates as supply chain costs and increased promotions squeezed its margins. In February, Estee Lauder announced it would cut jobs due to challenges in the Chinese market.\n\nUlta reiterated on Wednesday its comparable sales target of 4% to 5% growth for the year.\n\n(Reporting by Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

(NYSE:ELF) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q4 personal care earnings season.\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 13.4% below consensus. Inflation (despite slowing) has investors prioritizing near-term cash flows, but personal care stocks held their ground better than others, with share prices down 1.7% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\ne.l.f.

        "title": "Got $3,000? 2 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "Bear markets come and go, and as the market has proved once again in recent months, bull markets appear consistently in the aftermath. The S&P 500 has clocked a series of new highs to start off 2024 on a high note.\n\nWhile different stocks have experienced the market rebound in varying degrees, great businesses are continuing to demonstrate their resilience in all market environments. If you have a solid amount of cash to invest in stocks, say $3,000, there are plenty of intriguing companies that you could put a portion or the entirety of that amount into.\n\nHere are two names to consider that have monster growth potential in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nAbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) has been in a period of transition that is par for the course for most pharmaceutical companies during various business cycles. In the case of AbbVie, this has been the loss of patent exclusivity for a drug that was not only its top-selling product, but at one point was the top-selling drug in the world: Humira.\n\nCompetition from generic versions of Humira and the decline in sales that has resulted has had an obvious impact on AbbVie's balance sheet. That impact will take time to recede, but that doesn't mean that it's time to abandon ship on this business.\n\nFor one, AbbVie has a considerable portfolio that spans various disease concerns ranging from immunology to oncology to various neurological disorders. While its overall revenue and profits were down on a year-over-year basis in 2023, it still brought in $54 billion on the top line and $4.9 billion on the bottom line for the 12-month period, which is nothing to scoff at.\n\nTop-selling products include immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, oncology drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta, as well as Botox Therapeutic and Botox Cosmetic. AbbVie has been preparing for the loss of patent exclusivity for Humira for a long time, not only through the sales growth of newer mainstay products but through a series of acquisitions that will drive future business growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company recently acquired Immunogen, which is known for Elahere, a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. It's also in the process of its acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, a company that specializes in medicines for psychiatric and neurological disorders.\n\nOn March 25, AbbVie announced that it plans to acquire Landos Biopharma, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company whose lead drug candidate is a first-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\n\nThere's no reason to think that AbbVie doesn't have plenty of growth runway ahead, and investors looking at a long-term investment can enjoy the fruits of those labors. In the meantime, it's also worth mentioning that this storied dividend payer boasts a generous yield of about 3.5%. If you're looking for passive income and a quality business, AbbVie hits the mark on both fronts.\n\n2. e.l.f. Beauty\n\ne.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF) is known for its lines of clean beauty and makeup products that are vegan, are never tested on animals, and contain no animal-derived ingredients. The company has been in business for two decades, and has evolved through the years from an early mover in the e-commerce beauty space to establishing its own brick-and-mortar stores.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty later closed all of its brick-and-mortar stores to focus on its digital business and impressive global distribution network through long-standing partnerships with companies like Amazon, Walmart, Ulta Beauty, and Target. The company has revolutionized its marketing strategy in recent years to cater to a new generation of buyers and capitalize on the Gen Z beauty craze through mediums like TikTok.\n\nThe company has also launched a series of well-received campaigns that have driven customer acquisition and retention, such as its 2024 Game Day Commercial that featured Judge Judy, key members from the cast of the legal drama Suits, and appearances from a selection of popular TikTok influencers. Another popular ad campaign featured The White Lotus' Jennifer Coolidge.\n\nThe company's tailored approach to marketing by jumping on rapidly evolving pop culture trends and aligning them with the fast-changing world of beauty has translated to profits as well as steady growth for the business. e.l.f. Beauty has also found success with a remarkable asset-light business model.\n\nInstead of manufacturing its own products, it relies on a trusted network of third-party manufacturers in China, a model that is certainly not novel to e.l.f. Beauty but has proven incredibly effective. This has reduced a lot of the operating costs that the company would otherwise incur, while also allowing it to maintain its affordable lineup of products, where the average cost of an item runs at just $5. Those prices for a quality product create a compelling buying proposition in any market environment, and especially in challenging macro conditions.\n\nAt this point, e.l.f. Beauty has managed to deliver close to two dozen quarters of consecutive revenue growth, while steadily improving profitability. The most recent quarter saw the company report net sales of $271 million, an eye-popping 85% increase from the prior-year period. Net income for the quarter totaled $27 million, up 41% from one year ago.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty also just acquired a skin care brand called Naturium, a move that is not only expected to significantly augment sales growth but increase the company's share of the skincare market to a whopping 18%. With shares trading up more than 40% from the start of 2024 and about 150% from one year ago, it's fair to say investors are pumped about the stock. It may be a good idea to scoop up a few shares now before the stock rockets higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best beauty stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the global beauty industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Beauty Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe global beauty industry sits right at the heart of the multi billion dollar media and entertainment sector. Newscasters, television show hosts, models, actors, and even politicians have to groom themselves in order to address hundreds of thousands of people daily. Therefore, the beauty industry, made up of global giants, sits right at the top of the stock market when it comes to valuation.\n\nDon't believe us? Well, consider Insider Monkey's coverage of the 14 Biggest Beauty Companies In The World. At the top of the list are global beauty and cosmetics giants the likes of L'Or\u00e9al S.A. (OTC:LRLCF), The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL). Combined, these three firms have a whopping market capitalization of $438 billion, a figure that underscores the significant money that stock market investors have piled into the shares of the global beauty giants.\n\nWhen it comes to analyzing beauty stocks, they can broadly be categorized as consumer defensive firms. This is because personal health products, such as shampoos, deodorants, and soap - which are some of the most common beauty products in the world, are also essential items in the daily lives of millions of people.\n\nThe nature of the global beauty industry, particularly due to its proximity to media and entertainment, means that beauty stocks can simultaneously benefit from stable consumer markets and innovation. Modern day science has enabled firms such as the Italian Framesi and L'Or\u00e9al to provide innovative new products that use stem cells and fatty acids to help the human body battle against anti ageing and genetic effects.\n\nAdditionally, the beauty industry's requirement to ensure that it is up to date with all the latest trends younger generations, such as Gen Z, are following means that they are among some of the first adopters of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence. In fact, AI in beauty is one of the hottest trends in the world right now, with firms such as the Taiwanese Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) using artificial intelligence for skin analysis, grooming, and other beauty applications. Despite the fact that its shares are down by 73% since 2022, the company is busy updating its AI portfolio. March 2024 saw Perfect Corp. (NYSE:PERF) significantly improve the image processing capabilities of its jewelry virtual try-on (VTO) software by allowing users to upload 3D images. This software had previously allowed jewelry brands to create VTO effects with 2D images and eliminate the need to use complex 3D files.\n\nStory continues\n\nApart from NYSE:PERF, there are several other beauty technology stocks that are at the edge of the industry and exposed to innovation at the same time. A couple of these are Oddity Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ODD), Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB), and Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR). Starting from Elevai, the firm is a high end technology company when it comes to skincare products. It claims to use \"ultra-small, nanoparticle compartments packed with growth factors\" called \"exosomes\" to try and replicate the skin's natural healing process and deliver a fresh and youthful look. Yet, the exosomes haven't impressed Wall Street, with the stock down 78% over the past twelve months even as Elevai Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ELAB) saw some magic in January after it announced a global licensing deal for ethically sourced stem cells.\n\nOut of the other two beauty stocks in our brief analysis of beauty technology, only Oddity Tech Ltc. (NASDAQ:ODD) is worth mentioning when talking about performance. This beauty stock is up 57% over the past six months, with the surge starting roughly a month after Bank of American Corporation (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the shares to Buy from Neutral and, at the same time, cut the share price target to $37 from $60. Oddity is another beauty stock that sits right at the heart of the intersection of the multi billion dollar industry with artificial intelligence.\n\nIt uses software to help people buy beauty products right from the comfort of their homes, and the current bullish surge in share prices came after the firm's financial report for the third quarter of 2023. The figures marked a strong 37% annual revenue and 231% adjusted net income growth, and Oddity Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:ODD) topped this up in its succeeding financials which saw it reverse a year ago operating loss into income of $6.5 million.\n\nSo, seems like beauty stocks are dependent more on their underlying fundamentals, and if the product technology is able to generate market penetration and revenue then they will see investor interest.\n\nAs for the broader beauty industry and stocks, here's what Madison Investments had to say about The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter:\n\nEstee Lauder has seen a steep decline in its travel retail business in both China and Korea. We expect the travel retail business to begin to recover as we move into calendar 2024, but it will likely be in the second half of the year. China remains a key component to the Estee Lauder story and timing of a recovery in China remains difficult to forecast.\n\n. . .We also eliminated our position in Estee Lauder. Although the company has outlined a turnaround plan to return to growth and improve profitability during fiscal years 2025 and 2026, we believe that challenges remain in its core domestic market where it will be difficult to grow.\n\nSo which beauty stocks are on the hedge fund radar? Some notable picks are Kenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). 15 Best Beauty Stocks To Invest In\n\nA stylish young woman modeling a dress from the retailer showcasing its cutting-edge fashion.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best beauty stocks to invest in, we ranked all publicly traded companies on U.S. exchanges with a presence in the beauty industry by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q4 2023. Out of these, the top beauty stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these top beauty stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds\u2019 top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best defensive ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the consumer defensive industry, head over to 5 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets.\n\nIn January 2024, Goldman Sachs strategists classified small-caps and consumer staples stocks as potential areas of value in the current US stock market. The strategists observed that the market rally has gone beyond mega-cap stocks, and they suggested three trades that offer value in this highly-valued market. First are small caps, represented by the Russell 2000, which now trade below their 10-year average price-to-book ratio. The strategists expect a potential return of roughly 15% for the Russell 2000 in the next 12 months. Secondly, Goldman Sachs strategists favor stocks with weak pricing power, which could benefit from improving profit margins in a solid economic growth environment. Lastly, consumer staples shares are seen as offering attractive valuations, particularly as concerns about higher costs and new weight-loss drugs' impact on consumer behavior show signs of stabilizing. The investment firm added that \u201cpessimism around the Consumer Staples earnings outlook has also shown signs of bottoming\u201d.\n\nSee Also: Investing in Innovation: 10 Best Tech and Disruptive ETFs\n\nNik Modi, managing director and global co-head of consumer research at RBC Capital Markets, stated on BNN Bloomberg in January 2024 that it is challenging to generate profits in the consumer staple sector. However, he identified three companies with promising growth prospects in 2024 \u2013 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ). He commented:\n\n\u201cThere are bright spots \u2026 in this space and in an environment of underperformance, it really comes down to which companies have volume growth and which companies don\u2019t, and that\u2019s really what our top picks are oriented around.\u201d\n\nConsumer staples stocks faced challenges in 2023, but now with attractive valuations and the potential for rising profit margins and volumes in 2024, the sector may see better performance ahead, especially if defensive and dividend-paying stocks regain favor with investors, as perFidelity Investments. Last year, the defensive sector lagged behind as investors leaned towards mega-cap growth companies. Many firms faced difficulties amid a tough consumer environment marked by inflation and market share erosion to generic alternatives. Some companies responded by increasing discounts and advertising, though this didn't always translate to sales growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso Read: 12 Best Financial and Fintech ETFs To Buy\n\nThe packaged foods and meats segment, in particular, felt pressure from private-label alternatives and concerns regarding the impact of new weight-loss drugs on demand. On the other hand, household products companies benefited from improved gross profit margins due to lower input and freight costs. Fidelity noted that the sector's performance in 2024 hinges on the potential improvement in sales volumes, which could alleviate pricing pressure and enhance profit margins. Companies with appealing valuations and robust pricing power, especially in household products and soda, may present promising returns. Even with economic uncertainties, people keep buying everyday items, which could lead to more sales if consumers and the economy stay stable.\n\nSome of the best defensive stocks to buy include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).

Freshpet sells refrigerated, fresh pet food. Our thesis is predicated on the company sitting at the intersection of two significant, long-duration trends: health and wellness, and the humanization of pets.

Also, \u20182nd tier\u2019 varieties of asset-light businesses, like car dealerships (AutoNation and Penske Auto Group) and shipping brokers (Clarkson PLC and Braemar PLC). Less well reviewed have been a few companies that are asset intensive, but have particular inflation-beneficiary attributes.\n\nOne such is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), one of the largest agricultural commodities processors. They turn grains and legumes into flour, protein meals, oils, starches, syrups, cellulose pulp, what have you. Almost everything on a dinner plate came through, in some fashion, ADM\u2019s hands. Yes, they have machinery, terminals, ships, railroad cars. And as an intermediary, theirs is a low-margin business. But it is a constant-spread business that earns a pretty stable margin on a very large sales base. When pricing rises for a period of time, that percentage spread is on a higher dollar amount, hence more dollars of income\u2014so income can rise nicely when agricultural commodities do. And there is the opportunity to expand their margins somewhat\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n11. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:RSPS)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 25: 23.29%\n\nNext on our list of the best defensive ETFs is Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:RSPS).

There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.\n\nHeckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company\u2019s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America\u2019s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman\u2019s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets\u2026\u201d (Click here to see the full text)\n\n10.

Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 25: 39.10%\n\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA) aims to match the performance, before fees and expenses, of the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. This index is weighted by market capitalization and covers the large, mid, and small-cap segments of the US consumer staples sector. Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA) is one of the best defensive ETFs to invest in. As of December 31, 2023, the fund\u2019s assets amounted to $1,061.5 million, and its portfolio consisted of 108 stocks, along with an expense ratio of 0.084%.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is the largest holding of Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA). On February 15, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.485 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.4% increase from its prior dividend of $0.460. The dividend is payable on April 1, to shareholders on record as of March 15.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds held stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 57 funds in the last quarter.\n\nHayden Capital made the following comment about The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its third 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just emerging markets either, where one could argue a \u201cscarcity premium\u201d given fewer quality public companies. Even in the US, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) trades at ~30x P/E despite having the same earnings as 10 years ago.\n\nBoth of these companies actually have lower revenues than 10 \u2013 15 years ago too, indicating that their profit growth is mostly from margin expansion. This can only last for so long before there\u2019s no more excess expenses left to cut.\n\nI find it ironic that all these companies trade as \u201cbond-equivalents\u201d in the minds of investors \u2013 even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it\u2019s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Coca-Cola is facing disruption risk from consumers shifting to new, healthier beverage brands.\n\nBut these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022. By comparison, KO and PG are remarkably down only -4 \u2013 6% over that time frame.\u201d\n\n6. Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC)\n\n5-Year Share Price Performance as of March 25: 45.77%\n\nInvesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) tracks the S&P SmallCap 600 Capped Consumer Staples Index, investing primarily in small-capitalization US consumer staples companies. The index measures the performance of US consumer staples companies primarily engaged in providing non-cyclical consumer goods and services such as tobacco, textiles, food and beverage, and non-discretionary retail. Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC) ranks 5th on our list of the best defensive ETFs. As of March 22, 2024, the fund holds a portfolio of 30 stocks, featuring an expense ratio of 0.29%.\n\nWD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) is the top holding of Invesco S&P SmallCap Consumer Staples ETF (NASDAQ:PSCC). The company develops and sells maintenance products, homecare, and cleaning products globally. On March 19, WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 30, to shareholders on record as of April 19.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were long WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), up from 15 funds in the last quarter.\n\nDiamond Hill Capital made the following comment about WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC) markets a range of maintenance products, and homecare and cleaning products. We believe investors have unrealistic expectations about the company\u2019s ability to grow its revenue base enough to justify its valuation, and the company is likely to be less resilient as COVID-related tailwinds to its business subside. In Q3, shares of WD40 traded down on a weak earnings report that showed falling revenues as the company is also challenged by cost pressures.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best Affordable Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts 14 Best Medical Device Stocks To Buy Now 20 Highest Paid CEOs in the US and Their College Degrees\n\nDisclosure: None.\u00a014 Best Defensive ETFs To Buy For Plunging Markets is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Personal Care Stocks Q4 Teardown: Olaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX) Vs The Rest\n\nAs the craze of earnings season draws to a close, here's a look back at some of the most exciting (and some less so) results from Q4. Today we are looking at the personal care stocks, starting with Olaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX).\n\nWhile personal care products products may seem more discretionary than food, consumers tend to maintain or even boost their spending on the category during tough times. This phenomenon is known as \"the lipstick effect\" by economists, which states that consumers still want some semblance of affordable luxuries like beauty and wellness when the economy is sputtering. Consumer tastes are constantly changing, and personal care companies are currently responding to the public\u2019s increased desire for ethically produced goods by featuring natural ingredients in their products.\n\nThe 13 personal care stocks we track reported a mixed Q4; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 4% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 13.4% below consensus. Valuation multiples for growth stocks have reverted to their historical means after reaching highs in early 2021, but personal care stocks held their ground better than others, with share prices down 0.2% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nOlaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX)\n\nRising to fame on TikTok because of its \u201cbond building\" hair products, Olaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX) offers products and treatments that repair the damage caused by traditional heat and chemical-based styling goods.\n\nOlaplex reported revenues of $111.7 million, down 14.5% year on year, topping analyst expectations by 2.8%. It was a slower quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.\n\nAmanda Baldwin, OLAPLEX\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and represent another positive step towards stabilizing our demand trend. I am confident in the strong foundation of the OLAPLEX brand and believe that our priorities for the year ahead will position the company to return to consistent sales and profit growth.\"\n\nStory continues Olaplex Total Revenue\n\nThe stock is down 10.4% since the results and currently trades at $1.73.\n\nIs now the time to buy Olaplex?

It was a very strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts'\u00a0revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and EPS expectations. The market was expecting negative EBITDA and the company delivered positive EBITDA. Full year 2024 guidance for revenue calls for \"low-to-mid single digit percentage\" revenue growth and \"positive low-single digit to mid-single digit millions adjusted EBITDA\", which is encouraging.

        "content": "Momentum is a powerful force in the stock market. Once a stock becomes popular, its ascent can defy logic and lead to a stretched valuation. While some popular stocks crash within a few months, others live up to the hype.\n\nA swift recovery in 2023 has carried into 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both up year-to-date. Some investors look for opportunities to outperform the established benchmarks. While following the crowds isn\u2019t always the best approach, strong fundamentals can justify a stampede among investors. These top stocks are generating plenty of attention.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a beauty brand rapidly gaining market share and continues to reward long-term investors. The stock is up by roughly 1,800% over the past five years and is already off to a strong start with a 35% year-to-date gain. Shares trade at an 87 P/E ratio and are in the middle of a healthy correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHigh growth rates for revenue and earnings have propelled the stock over the years. The firm reported its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. It wasn\u2019t a small growth rate either. Net sales were 85% higher in Q3 FY24 year-over-year (YoY).\n\nNet income also got a strong boost and was up by 41% YoY. E.l.f. Beauty used some of those proceeds to acquire Naturism, a fast-growing, high-performance skin brand. The company funded the acquisition with cash and company stock.\n\nThe cosmetics company raised its fiscal 2024 outlook across the board. Net sales are expected to reach $980 to $990 million compared to $896 to $906 million in the previous fiscal 2024 outlook. The previous guidance also projected diluted EPS to range from $2.47 to $2.50, while it now ranges from $2.84 to $2.87 per share.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and software\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has captured headlines for several years, but the artificial intelligence boom has created an incredible stampede among investors. The stock is up by more than 1,900% over the past five years and has already gained 82% year-to-date.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Nvidia has a 75 P/E ratio, the chipmaker\u2019s revenue and earnings growth suggest a better valuation is on the horizon. Nvidia\u2019s 265% YoY revenue growth and 769% YoY GAAP net income growth in Q4 FY24 outpaced the stock\u2019s 1-year gain of 249%.\n\nAs long as net income growth keeps up with the stock\u2019s appreciation, shares can continue to move higher. Nvidia\u2019s profit margins have soared alongside its earnings, with net profit margins surpassing 50% for the past two quarters.\n\nNvidia has delivered generational gains for some investors. Some investors may feel as if the stock is due for a crash since assets don\u2019t go up forever. However, Nvidia still has the financial strength and tailwinds to gain from here. The firm\u2019s latest AI chips recently added more fuel to the rally.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) stocks to buy: construction workers work on a concrete floor\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a construction company specializing in e-infrastructure. Many blue-chip companies turn to Sterling for assistance with developing data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehouses and more. It\u2019s the company\u2019s fastest-growing segment, but the corporation also offers solutions for transportation and home building.\n\nThe stock has done well so far. It\u2019s up 770% over the past five years and has already gained 25% year-to-date. The firm generated $486.0 million in revenue and $40.2 million in net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. Those are YoY growth rates of 8.3% and 99%, respectively.\n\nSterling Infrastructure closed out the quarter with a $2.07 billion backlog. The company\u2019s backlog exceeds the $1.97 billion it generated in full-year 2023. The firm still has a reasonable 24 P/E ratio and is valued at over $3 billion. The stock also has a reasonable 1.09 PEG ratio.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and NVDA.

Store closures were the result of strict lockdown procedures, which had detrimental implications. Between March and April 2020, global sales decreased by 60\u201370%. As customers reduced their spending on cosmetics and grooming products, companies responded positively by increasing manufacturing and offering hand sanitizers and cleaning agents.\n\nIn the US, people's desire for individualized products has been growing. Asia-Pacific was the most prosperous region globally in 2022, with a revenue share of 39.65%. North America's CAGR is predicted to be 4.4% between 2023 and 2030. Consumers in North American countries such as the US and Canada are willing to pay extra for skin that appears more youthful and vibrant. Face creams and moisturizers had the largest revenue share (42.11%) in 2022, and it is expected that this trend will be steady for the duration of the forecast.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Growing Organic Skincare Industry:\n\nAs more individuals seek natural and eco-friendly substitutes for traditional cosmetics, organic skincare products are becoming increasingly popular.\n\nThe size of the global market for organic skin care was valued at $9.83 billion in 2021, and it is projected to increase at a CAGR of 8.9% between 2022 and 2030, as per Grand View Research. Throughout the projected time frame, the demand for organic skin care products is anticipated to be driven by consumers' growing preference for chemical-free beauty products as well as the expanding ideas of creams, serums, and moisturizers infused with organic ingredients. Customers are anticipated to use these products more frequently since they are considered to be more efficient and have fewer negative effects on the skin.\n\nTo satisfy the rising demand for organic skincare products, skincare companies are concentrating on product breakthroughs, new product launches, and portfolio expansion. For instance, in June 2022, the Australian natural skincare company Biologi introduced the first anti-pollution serum ever made with strawberry gum leaf extract.\n\nA major participant in the skincare industry, Loreal, acquired the California-based American skincare brand Youth to the People for an undisclosed amount in December 2022. The acquisition was made to produce vegan skin care products that are mindful of our health.\n\nBusinesses are switching to skincare products without parabens. Renee Cosmetics introduced its premium facial oils in January 2021. This product is FDA-approved and makes claims that it is organic, cruelty-free, and paraben-free.\n\nSkincare Companies are Evolving Rapidly:\n\nIn response to the increasing consumer desire for sustainable, natural, and organic products, the skincare sector is changing quickly. To meet the evolving needs and tastes of their customers, businesses are putting a greater emphasis on sustainability, innovation, and transparency.\n\nThe organic skincare market has been significantly impacted by e.l.f.

Beauty aims to increase its retail skincare sales share to roughly 18%, giving it a stronger position in the market. In 2023, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

Beauty, which makes it a perfect partner for the skincare industry's expansion and growth.\n\nSince Naturium is only available in the United States through Target and Amazon in addition to its direct-to-consumer website, E.l.f. Beauty also intends to increase its partnerships with retailers. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) CEO Tarang Amin stated in a conference:\n\n\u201cIn terms of our plans, I\u2019d say first, near term it\u2019s to really maximize where Naturium already is,\u201d Tarang said. \u201cCertainly given the momentum that Naturium has, there are going to be other distribution opportunities for Naturium that we\u2019ll look into. We\u2019re not ready to talk about those yet but obviously, you can see the track record we\u2019ve had on E.l.f. and our ability to get E.l.f. broadly distributed. ... We feel there are opportunities not only in the U.S. but also internationally.\u201d\n\nNaturium is a skincare brand dedicated to providing environmentally friendly, clinically effective skincare products for all skin types. The brand highlights how effective and powerful actives and organic ingredients can be in helping consumers attain a healthy complexion. The cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, gluten-free, and dermatologist-tested nature of Naturium's products demonstrates their dedication to skin compatibility and clean beauty.\n\nThe beauty industry has been significantly influenced by Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) recent purchases in the skincare sector. Farmacy Beauty, a 'farm-to-face' company acclaimed for its cruelty-free and sustainable procedures, was purchased by Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in 2021.\n\nThrough this acquisition, Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been able to increase its market share in the skincare sector and provide customers with more options that support ethical beauty practices. In 2023, Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) had an astonishing annual revenue of $82 billion.\n\nFurthermore, Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) acquired Tula Skincare in 2022, a company that makes probiotic skincare products. Tula Skincare was co-founded by Dr. Roshini Raj, Ken Landis, and Dan Reich, and its revenues surpassed $150 million in the United States in 2021.\n\nProcter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)'s acquisition of Tula Skincare enhances its standing in the premium beauty industry and gives it access to the expanding market for probiotic skincare products.\n\nWith that said, here are the 15 biggest skincare companies in the US.  15 Biggest Skincare Companies in the US\n\nvgstudio/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology:\n\nWe have picked the 15 biggest skincare companies in the US based on their annual revenue figures for 2023.

        "title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About e.l.f. Beauty (ELF): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about e.l.f. Beauty (ELF).\n\ne.l.f. Beauty currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 66.7% of all recommendations.\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for e.l.f. Beauty here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying e.l.f. Beauty, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs ELF Worth Investing In?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for e.l.f. Beauty, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.7% over the past month to $3.04.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for e.l.f. Beauty. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for e.l.f. Beauty may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "There\u2019s nothing cosmetic about this beauty product maker\u2019s success",
        "content": "Elf, which stands for ears, lips and face, was founded in 2004 as an online-only brand\n\nElf Beauty has emerged as one of America\u2019s most sensational consumer brands of the past decade. The cosmetics group is achieving incredible growth, is very profitable and looks capable of delivering plenty more of the same.\n\nThe success of Elf\u2019s products comes down to their appeal to Gen Z, built on expert marketing and product innovation. The brand promises its mainly young customers products that are cruelty free, clean and vegan, high quality \u2013 and affordable. The ethos is reflected in a board and workforce that are young, diverse and more than two-thirds female.\n\nIf this is all starting to sound a bit woke, even an investor dug deep into an opposing culture war trench would find it hard to argue with the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nElf has achieved compound annual sales growth of 27pc over the past five calendar years and 34pc for adjusted earnings per share. Gross profit margins (those before operating costs) are 71pc and return on capital employed was 20pc in the last reported financial year to the end of March 2023.\n\nThe balance sheet is also sound: net debt at the end of 2023 was equivalent to 0.9 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda).\n\nElf, which stands for ears, lips and face, was founded in 2004 as an online-only brand \u2013 a move necessitated by a beauty magazine\u2019s insistence that products have national distribution to feature on its pages.\n\nThe company\u2019s rapid growth attracted private equity backing before it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016. Since then it has attracted investment from some of the world\u2019s top-performing fund managers.\n\nTwelve of these professional investors, each among the top 3pc of the more than 10,000 equity fund managers tracked by financial publisher Citywire, own shares in Elf. That results in a top AAA rating from Citywire Elite Companies, which rates companies on the basis of their backing by the world\u2019s best fund managers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible at creating brand value around its products,\u201d says Fred Stanske, manager of the top-performing FullerThaler Behavioral Small Cap Growth fund, which counts Elf as a top-10 holding.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnderpinning the success is the fact that Elf is an extremely smart operator. Combining high margins, high quality and low prices is not a circle many square. Key to Elf\u2019s ability to do so is its asset-light \u201chybrid supply chain\u201d. In practice, this means having flexible relationships with lots of Chinese suppliers, including some kept on standby.\n\nIt stays very close to these suppliers. At the end of the last financial year, China was home to about a quarter of staff, of whom there are 420 in total. Such proximity allows close work with suppliers on product innovation.\n\nThis is another thing Elf seems very good at. It uses social media to stay on top of trends and to launch new products astoundingly quickly.\n\nAverage turnaround on new launches is just 20 weeks, while some hit the market in as few as 13. Elf\u2019s own digital marketing of these products is meanwhile amplified by customers cooing about its products online.\n\nIn the financial year to the end of March 2023, 22pc of net sales, or $126m (\u00a399m), went on marketing. Testament to its effectiveness is the growth of Elf\u2019s share of the US market in colour cosmetics (eye shadows, foundations, lipsticks and the like) from 4.1pc to 9.8pc over five years. That\u2019s taken it from the fifth-largest mass-market player to the third.\n\nThe company is now boosting brand awareness beyond Gen Z with national TV campaigns. It is also growing international sales, which currently account for 14pc of the total, compared with about 70pc for longer-established peers.\n\nSkincare is another big growth opportunity. Last year\u2019s $355m acquisition of Naturium doubles the proportion of group sales from this product category to 18pc. The US skincare market is only slightly smaller than cosmetics, at an estimated $6bn versus $7bn, but is expanding faster, at 6pc a year versus 1.5pc. That leaves Elf plenty of opportunity for growth.\n\nDespite its online roots, much of the group\u2019s revenue now comes through major retail chains. In the last financial year its top three customers generated 60pc of revenues. This sales concentration is a risk, but Elf is a brand retailers have every reason to stock because their products fly off the shelves.\n\nAnother risk for shareholders is the valuation. At 57 times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, the rating is in nosebleed territory.\n\nBut some of the world\u2019s top fund managers believe the shares are worth it, given high returns on capital, an exemplary record and forecasts of continued growth; earnings per share are predicted to reach more than double last year\u2019s level by 2025.

This looks like a good year so far after a strong 2023.\n\nEven though numerous stocks are up for the year, the rally for some equities is just getting started. Some stocks look poised to leap 50% higher from current levels due to strong earnings and enticing growth prospects.\n\nThese are some of the bull market stocks to consider as investors start to feel optimistic about the stock market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers healthier sports drinks than the competition. The company removes many unhealthy ingredients that are common in many beverages. Celsius Holdings\u2019 focus on health is attracting younger generations and rapidly expanding its market share.\n\nShares are up by 112% over the past year and gained 5,230% over the past five years. The stock would have to reach roughly $100/share to experience a 50% gain, and that growth is possible for the firm.\n\nCelsius Holdings is touted as the next\u00a0Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), which has surprisingly outperformed every stock over the past 30 years. That\u2019s right, a beverage company beat out all of the innovative tech giants.\n\nCelsius Holdings isn\u2019t going to experience the same returns as someone who bought and held MNST stock for 30 years. However, the company can generate meaningful returns for investors thanks to high revenue and earnings growth rates.\n\nRevenue increased by 104% year-over-year in\u00a0Q3 2023, while net income jumped by 146% year-over-year. Net profit margins exceeded 20%.\n\nAll of the revenue and earnings growth is coming from domestic sales. That\u2019s the most exciting part about this stock. Celsius Holdings is just starting to penetrate European markets. Once it gets a good foothold in that continent, it can then set its sights on Asia. Celsius Holdings is a domestic winner and has vast potential as it taps into global markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.l.f.

Beauty (NYSE:ELF) would have to get to roughly $300/share to complete a 50% leap from current prices. Momentum and financials are both on this company\u2019s side. Shares are up by 171% over the past year and have gained 2,361% over the past five years. Despite the big rally, the stock only trades at a 57-forward P/E ratio.\n\nI use the word \u201conly\u201d because revenue and earnings growth have accelerated. The company increased net sales by 85% year-over-year in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024 while gaining 305 basis points of market share. Net income increased by 40.7% year-over-year, prompting the company to raise its fiscal 2024 outlook.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty is known for beating estimates, growing at a fast pace and improving profit margins. The company\u2019s beauty products are also well-known, especially among Gen Z. The beauty firm does not use the unethical ingredients more common in other beauty products. It has achieved 20 consecutive quarters of sales growth, and the company is poised to extend that streak.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia is a momentum stock that has crushed expectations and actually lives up to the hype. Shares are up by 234% over the past year and have gained 1,902% over the past five years. While the 1-year gain may sound excessive, the company reported 769% year-over-year net income growth in\u00a0Q3 FY24.\n\nThe artificial intelligence leader can continue its rally as long as net income growth exceeds stock gains. A 265% year-over-year revenue gain suggests there will be more net income growth in future quarters.\n\nEventually, revenue growth will slow down, and we will have to get comfortable with high double-digit growth rates. However, Nvidia can report several quarters of high net income growth that further solidify its reasonable valuation. The company would have to reach about $1,180 to experience a 50% gain from current levels.\n\nNvidia has what it takes to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded corporation and dethrone\u00a0Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) from that title. Investors have a lot to gain even from current levels if Nvidia realizes this goal.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH, ELF and NVDA.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 10 stocks that will make you rich in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the financial markets and expert outlook, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2024.\n\nSo far, the Fed\u2019s efforts have managed to contain the inflation and is expected to push the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession like the European countries such as the U.K. and Germany experienced.\n\nLast year was another strange year for the market as it was believed that the US economy would go into a recession. However, the complete opposite happened, and the S&P 500 was able to manage gains of over 25%. While it is believed that growth stocks usually perform well during interest rate cuts and have bearish outcomes during economic downturns, the economy was saved by the technology sector, which is dominated by growth stocks. Companies like Nvidia and Meta saw triple-digit growth and are still up 63.63% and 39.78% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of market closing on February 23.\n\nIt is important to note that while it is a popular belief that AI and semiconductor stocks were the top performers of the year, it is not entirely true. Blockchain and crypto news were wildly overshadowed by the AI revolution. Some of the best-performing ETFs included Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) and Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI). However, cryptocurrencies have shown a significant amount of volatility in the first two months of the year.\n\nWhile the Fed has not been clear on its rate-cutting position in 2024, experts believe that it might start in the first half of the year, which means that growth stocks might make you rich in 2024. Although experts still have mixed opinions about the current year, you can still take a look at 14 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now, which also contains a list of stocks with the potential to make you rich in 2024.\n\n2024 Outlook According to Analysts\n\nEven though 2023 was a great year for the market, many analysts believe that the current year might not be as great and should be an average year. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise as the news of a soft landing has been spreading around. The \u201caverage year\u201d analysis is provided by Morgan Stanley, which believes in it due to normalizing financial conditions, excessive valuations, and a few other factors. The firm suggests maintaining a preference for value stocks as compared to growth stocks at least till the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, B.Riley and JP Morgan have quite bullish views about the future of the market. One of their main concerns is the over-valuation of stocks due to the 2023 rally. JP Morgan warns about a potential 20% to 30% dip in the market, while B. Riley Strategist Paul Dietrich predicts a mild recession, which could steer the market toward a 40% decline.\n\nWhile most analysts believe in a mediocre market performance this year, there are still some investments that can make you rich. For this purpose, we created a list of stocks that could make you rich in 2024, and some of them include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). 10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich In 2024\n\nA financial analyst looking through a microscope at stocks to determine their market value.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we chose the 10 stocks that will make you rich according to the consensus opinion of financial media websites such as The Motley Fool, Kiplinger, and Moneycontrol in addition to financial services firms like Morningstar and some experts.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 16 best Russell 2000 stocks to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the Russell 2000 index and overall stock market performance, head over to 5 Best Russell 2000 Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2023, small-cap stocks experienced a substantial rally, with the Russell 2000 Index gaining 14.0% by the end of the year. This outperformance was notable both in absolute terms and relative to large-cap indices like the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, which gained 12.0% and 10.9% for the quarter, respectively. The Federal Reserve's decision to halt rate hikes contributed to a robust performance in domestic equities. In light of the remarkable fourth quarter, the Russell 2000 was no longer in a bear market by the end of 2023, yet it remained down 14.3% from its peak on November 8, 2021, according to Royce Investments. The Russell 2000 lagged behind its large-cap counterpart for 2023, with gains of 16.9% compared to 26.5%, as well as for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ending on December 31, 2023. Although both small-cap style indexes performed well in the fourth quarter of 2023, the advantage clearly favored small-cap value, with the Russell 2000 Value Index gaining 15.3% compared to 12.7% for the Russell 2000 Growth Index. This occurrence of small-cap value outperforming growth, especially with double-digit gains, is relatively rare, happening 35% of the time since the inception of the Russell 2000 on December 31, 1978.\n\nIn December 2023, US small-cap stocks reached historically low relative values compared to large caps, as reported by LSEG Datastream. The small-cap S&P 600, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13.7, traded below its long-term average of 18, contrasting sharply with the current level of 19 for the S&P 500. European small caps also displayed a similar trend, with a forward P/E ratio of 12.2, falling below the 15-year average of 15 and the broader MSCI Europe's current P/E of 12.3. This undervaluation has increased the attractiveness of small caps in a broader market rally driven by expectations of global central banks cutting rates in 2024 amid declining inflation.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistorically, US small caps have outperformed large caps during periods of rising growth and slowing inflation, with the Russell 2000 showing an annualized gain of 25.2%, compared to 17.3% for the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Wealth's analysis of data dating back to the 1970s. Morningstar Wealth is overweight on small caps in its US equity fund, considering the cheap valuations as a source of \"margin of safety,\" as highlighted by Marta Norton, the chief investment officer in the Americas. Additionally, there is an expectation of a turnaround in small-cap earnings. LSEG data forecasts a 30% increase in earnings for Russell 2000 companies in 2024, following an 11.5% decline in 2023. This positive outlook adds to the appeal of small-cap stocks in the current market landscape.\n\nRecently, Sahak Manuelian, the managing director and head of equity trading at Wedbush, joined BNN Bloomberg, expressing that small-caps and long-duration assets have been experiencing significant upward movement. He asserted that this trend is ongoing and predicted further upside for the Russell 2000.\n\nAccording to elite hedge funds, some of the best Russell 2000 stocks to invest in include Chord Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHRD), Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), and Cytokinetics, Incorporated (NASDAQ:CYTK).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this list, we consulted the iShares Russell 2000 ETF.

        "title": "Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe projected fair value for e.l.f. Beauty is US$192 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity e.l.f. Beauty's US$186 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 4.1% lower than e.l.f. Beauty's analyst price target of US$200\n\nDoes the February share price for e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nThe Method\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\nStory continues\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$133.6m US$222.5m US$327.0m US$409.3m US$484.3m US$549.7m US$605.5m US$652.6m US$692.7m US$727.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x1 Est @ 25.18% Est @ 18.31% Est @ 13.51% Est @ 10.14% Est @ 7.79% Est @ 6.14% Est @ 4.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$125 US$194 US$265 US$310 US$342 US$362 US$372 US$374 US$371 US$363\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.1b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$727m\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.3%) = US$15b\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$15b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$7.6b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$11b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$186, the company appears about fair value at a 3.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at e.l.f. Beauty as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.066. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for e.l.f. Beauty\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nShareholders have been diluted in the past year.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nNo apparent threats visible for ELF.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For e.l.f. Beauty, we've compiled three essential aspects you should assess:\n\nRisks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for e.l.f. Beauty that you should be aware of before investing here.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy. To skip our analysis of the recent trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 High Growth Consumer Stocks to Buy.\n\nConsumer stocks include stocks across two sectors that include companies offering products and services directly to consumers. The consumer staples sector provides essential products and services that are used by consumers on a daily basis. It includes food and beverages, household goods, hygiene products, and personal items, among others. On the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector provides non-essential goods and services including automobiles, luxury goods, and leisure items, among others.\n\nThe nature of products and services provided by the respective sectors significantly impacts the top and bottom lines for the companies providing these goods and services. Consumer Staples, with the provision of essential goods and services, has a more stable and robust top and bottom line as its demand remains relatively stable even in times of macroeconomic instability. On the other hand, customers tend to cut down their expenditures when it comes to consumer discretionary items when adverse macroeconomic situations persist.\n\nThe consumer staples sector faced challenges in the past year as the companies had to face rising inflation as well as increasing competition from private-label companies in the sector. The consumer staples sector benefits from attractive valuations as the stocks in the sector lost favor last year when investors flocked to mega-tech stocks. Attractive valuations, improving profit margins, and strong pricing power may translate into a positive year for the big names in the sector, according to Ben Shuleva, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager.\n\nOn the other hand, the consumer discretionary sector depicted resilience in the face of these challenges as pent up demand from previous years kept overall demand stable during 2023. According to Jordan Michaels, Fidelity Sector Portfolio Manager, the consumer discretionary sector is expected to continue to perform well this year as well, supported by interest rate cuts, lower inflation rates, and industry-wide factors.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur list of 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy includes some of the most notable names in the consumer sectors and is dominated by companies from the consumer discretionary sector as these companies managed to grow their revenues significantly despite the incumbent macroeconomic adversity. These companies have benefited from multiple factors recently. For instance, Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ:LI) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) significantly increased their production recently which has translated into high revenue growth. Similarly, the list includes multiple resorts and casino operators such as Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) which have benefited from the resurgence of the travel and leisure industry.\n\nA supermarket shelf overflowing with a variety of fast-moving consumer goods.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo come up with 14 high growth consumer stocks to buy, we have used stock screeners to identify high growth consumer stocks. We filtered the stocks with at least $2.0 billion in market capitalization and a year-over-year revenue growth of more than 30% for the latest quarter, as of February 9. We then proceeded to rank the companies in ascending order of their revenue growth.\n\nWe have also provided hedge fund ownership data for the stocks on our list.

We continue to be attracted to DraftKing\u2019s dominant market share and the scale advantages that come with this.\u201d\n\n11.

(NASDAQ:PDD):\n\n\u201cUsing insights gleaned from our close proximity to e-commerce at CTT, we undertook a multi-month effort to underwrite PDD Holdings. This US-listed Irish holding company owns China\u2019s leading disruptive marketplace called PinDuoDuo. During the summer, as it became unbearable for most investors to remain publicly invested in Chinese equities, we took a position in PDD. Adding to the narrative during the summer for PDD was that its international business, Temu, was burning cash and carried with it a negative valuation consolidated into PDD\u2019s holding company structure. Yet, as we were able to validate the major competitive advantage its direct-selling model has, from Chinese factory direct to the global consumer, we understood the losses to be highly temporary as the company leaned into digital marketing \u2014 becoming by far the largest digital advertiser on all leading platforms.\u201d\n\n6.

        "content": "Growth stocks give investors the opportunity to earn elevated returns that outperform market indices. These corporations often exhibit rising revenue and earnings. Getting into these stocks early can offer tremendous upside.\n\nSome of these stocks fly under the radar for several months or years before they get mainstream attention. Therefore, investors looking for ways to grow their capital may want to consider these three assets.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) offers affordable beauty and skincare products and is a big hit among Gen Z. The company only uses ethical ingredients in its beauty products. People are becoming more conscious of the ingredients they consume, which bodes well for the beauty corporation.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso, this shift in consumer behavior has rewarded long-term investors. Elf Beauty delivered another quarter of impressive results, highlighted by\u00a085% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth. The cosmetics firm increased its market share by 305 basis points and achieved its 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth.\n\nAdditionally, net income grew at an even faster pace and was up by 184% YOY. The company\u2019s net profit margin came in at 15.44%. Elf Beauty has been a top momentum stock with a 123% gain over the past year and a 5-year gain of 1,678%. Shares trade at a 48.5 forward P/E ratio.\n\nLooking forward, valuation will become more attractive as ELF continues to report high revenue and net income growth. Therefore, investors should have a multi-year horizon if they want to accumulate shares in this corporation.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSports drinks are a hot commodity. Loyal customers frequently buy these beverages, allowing companies to report high revenue and earnings growth. These drinks become engrained habits that fit into people\u2019s day-to-day lives.\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is capitalizing on the sports drink market and is gobbling up market share. Revenue increased by 104% YOY in the third quarter of 2023. Almost all of the firm\u2019s revenue comes from North America. CELH is now starting to penetrate international markets, which can lead to explosive revenue growth moving forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy the time domestic revenue growth decelerates, international sales can take its place. Also, the company is extremely profitable, reporting 146% YOY net income growth. This improvement helped the company secure a 21.82% net profit margin in the quarter.\n\nDespite soaring by 5,247% over the past five years, Celsius Holdings\u2019 stock has only been up by 3% over the past six months. Thus, a rally seems imminent. And investors have already bid up the stock by 25% since the end of January. The company\u2019s March earnings report can serve as a catalyst for a higher stock price.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NASDAQ:STRL) is a construction company that develops e-infrastructure solutions in high-demand markets like the southeast and southwest portions of the U.S.\n\nE-infrastructure solutions encompass data centers, warehouses, and other types of properties. Data center demand has been picking up due to AI and has helped the stock surge in recent years.\n\nSterling Infrastructure\u2019s stock has more than doubled over the past year and is up by 480% over the past five years. Despite the big rally, shares still trade at a 17-forward P/E ratio and a\u00a00.87 PEG ratio. These valuation metrics suggest the stock has more room to run.\n\nSTRL delivered robust financials in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 25% YOY while the e-infrastructure solutions backlog reached $891 million. That represents a 48% YOY increase. The company\u2019s profit margins have been rising quickly. Further, it is possible for the company to report double-digit profit margins in one of its 2024 reports.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF and CELH.

        "content": "You don\u2019t have to stay on top of the stock market and make quick trading decisions to be a successful investor. Some people outperform the market by investing in solid, long-term stocks and letting time do its magic. These investors can then focus on growing their income so they can make higher portfolio contributions in the future.\n\nBetter, long-term stocks have promising growth prospects and operate in promising industries. If you wait long enough, these seven growth stocks, for example, can generate meaningful returns.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) offers a healthy sports drink that is captivating Gen Z and broader audiences. Drinks contain seven essential vitamins and do not include any sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, or aspartame. Celsius compensates by putting a lot of caffeine in its drinks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius is positioned as the front-runner for healthy energy drinks. As people look for healthy choices that don\u2019t require them to make inconvenient sacrifices, Celsius can continue to gain market share. The beverage tastes good based on its 104% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of 2023. People aren\u2019t going to buy that much product if it tastes bad.\n\nCelsius Holdings has generated meaningful long-term value for shareholders. The equity has gained 5,247% over the past five years. The stock is also up by 94% over the past year but has been trading sideways for the past six months. The reduced activity over the past six months makes the stock more attractive heading into earnings.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), which offers stability and growth for long-term investors. Credit and debit cards are integral to society and are the preferred payment method for many consumers. It\u2019s hard to resist cashback rewards and other perks that come with these cards.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa\u2019s latest earnings report showcased this truth. Revenue jumped by 9% year-over-year in Q1 FY24 while GAAP net income increased by 17% year-over-year. GAAP EPS growth outpaced GAAP net income growth due to the company\u2019s commitment to repurchase shares.\n\nVisa bought back $3.4 billion worth of shares in the quarter. The fintech company distributed $1.06 billion in dividends during the quarter. Visa\u00a0hiked its dividend near the end of 2023 by 15.5% year-over-year. The quarterly dividend per share jumped from $0.45 to $0.52 as part of the hike.\n\nVisa has been a steady gainer. The stock is up by 21% over the past year and has gained 92% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an advertising leader and stands to reward shareholders as another one of the top long-term stocks to own. The company recently achieved 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 compared to a 1% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nAd revenue will likely increase even more in 2024 due to the Olympics, Elections, and other factors. While advertisements are the majority of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, the company has reinvested its revenue into other ventures.\n\nGoogle Cloud is the most successful segment outside of Google advertisements. Cloud revenue jumped from $7.3 billion to $9.2 billion year-over-year. This component of Alphabet\u2019s business recently became profitable.\n\nAlphabet will continue to use some of its capital to fund \u201cOther Bets.\u201d It\u2019s a small category filled with unprofitable high-growth opportunities that can become meaningful segments in the future.\u00a0Alphabet has been a staple in many funds. Shares are up by 57% over the past year and have gained 167% over the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to deliver top-line and bottom-line growth for investors. The tech giant reported 18% year-over-year revenue growth and 33% year-over-year net income growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\u00a0It\u2019s also another one of the top long-term stocks to buy and hold.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella cited \u201capplying AI at scale\u201d as a reason the company is winning new customers and driving productivity gains across every sector. Microsoft Cloud has also been a core component of the company\u2019s success. Cloud revenue increased by 24% year-over-year and made up more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue.\n\nMicrosoft is currently the most valuable company on the stock market with a market cap above $3 trillion. Shares have rallied by 49% over the past year and have surged by 275% over the past five years.\n\nMany funds have large amounts of this stock, and it\u2019s a top holding in the\u00a0Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. The company offers a healthy blend of stability and growth while trading at a 37 P/E ratio. The stock\u2019s dividend yield is currently 0.75%.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a leader in the credit and debit card industry that offers healthy profit margins. The fintech company closed out 2023 with 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year net income growth. Those growth rates helped the company maintain a net profit margin above 40%.\n\nThe dividend growth stock has rewarded investors with a 26% gain over the past year and is up by 109% over the past five years. The stock only offers a 0.57% dividend yield, but growth has been impressive. Mastercard raised its quarterly dividend per share from $0.57 to $0.66 in 2024. That\u2019s a 15.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nMastercard didn\u2019t stop with dividends. The company also repurchased 4.5 million shares for $1.8 billion. For comparison, Mastercard only distributed $534 million in dividends during the same quarter. Buybacks exceeded dividends by a wide margin in 2023, which suggests the company has a lot of room to hike its dividends.\n\nCEO Michael Miebach cited strong consumer spending and cross-border volume growth as key catalysts for the successful quarter. Mastercard has various rewards cards to the point where there\u2019s something for everyone.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany investors look at a stock\u2019s historical performance to gauge if it is a promising investment. While stock analyses must go deeper than one-year and five-year charts, strong gains during both of these timeframes can make a stock look more attractive.\n\nInvestors with this mentality will want to give\u00a0Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) a closer look. The stock has gained 123% over the past year and is up by 1,678% over the past five years. Any investor would want those numbers, but they must also consider if a rapidly growing stock still offers a good opportunity at the current price.\n\nElf Beauty once again delivers on this front, and the recent\u00a0Q3 FY24 report demonstrates why investors are accumulating more shares. During this quarter, Elf Beauty achieved 85% year-over-year net sales growth and 184% year-over-year net income growth. The quarter marked the 20th consecutive quarter in which Elf Beauty gained market share and reported net sales growth.\n\nThat type of track record makes the stock more promising for long-term investors. Shares currently trade at a 48.5 forward P/E ratio that can get lower as the firm continues to deliver impressive results.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) offers compelling growth in a high-demand vertical. The company\u2019s language learning app grew its revenue by 43% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2023. Duolingo also experienced meaningful growth in its active users. Monthly active users were up by 47% year-over-year while daily active users increased by 63% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s financial growth and business opportunities will attract growth investors. The only concern is the stock\u2019s valuation. Duolingo currently trades with a\u00a093-forward P/E ratio. That\u2019s not for everyone but the valuation will become more manageable within a few years.\n\nLong-term investors may want to nibble on the stock and build positions as the valuation becomes easier to justify. The asset will look more attractive on pullbacks. While this is true about any stock, Duolingo has the distinction of meaningful revenue and net income growth. Not every publicly traded corporation can make that same claim.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CELH, GOOG, MSFT, and ELF.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Could Make You Richer in 2024",
        "content": "It's a great time to have money in the stock market. The S&P 500 and DowJonesIndustrialAverage have both set new all-time highs this year, and the NasdaqComposite is up almost 34% over the last 12 months.\n\nIn short, it's a target-rich environment for stock pickers. So let's have a look at three stocks that I believe can help make investors richer in 2024.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Ferrari\n\nTopping my list is Ferrari (NYSE: RACE). This Italian company, known for its high-performance, luxury sports cars, has seen its stock steadily climb over the last few years. Shares are up 217% since 2019.\n\nLike fellow European luxury brand LVMH, Ferrari is cashing in on extravagance. Ferrari's vehicles typically come with a sales price ranging from $300,000 to $600,000. Some models can sell for as much as $3 million.\n\nNeedless to say, these are not cars for the masses. Rather, Ferrari targets highly affluent consumers willing to pay top dollar for sports cars that make statements.\n\nAnd it's a business model that has produced fantastic results. Trailing 12-month revenue has grown from $3.7 billion in 2019 to nearly $6.5 billion as of this writing. Operating margin -- a key measure of profitability -- has increased from 24% to 26.8% over the last five years. RACE Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWith revenue growing 17% as of its most recent earnings report (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2023), Ferrari remains a name to remember for growth-oriented investors.\n\n2. e.l.f. Beauty\n\nNext is e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF). e.l.f. -- which stands for \"eyes, lips, and face\" -- is a cosmetics company on the rise. Founded in 2004, the company debuted via an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016.\n\nThe company produces and sells value-priced makeup and skincare products online and at various retailers. Chief among those retailers is Target, where it now stands as the retailer's top-selling color cosmetic brand, according to data from Nielsen. Source: e.l.f. earnings presentation.\n\ne.l.f.'s stock has surged as the brand's popularity has taken off. Shares are up an eye-popping 1,730% since 2019, recording an incredible 78% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over that period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat's more, analysts expect big things as more and more consumers learn about the company and it expands product offerings. Wall Street expects the company's sales to rise 71% in 2024 to almost $1 billion. In 2025, sales are estimated to rise to $1.25 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year.\n\nFurthermore, with a market cap of less than $10 billion, the company could be a buyout candidate for larger cosmetics or consumer-facing companies. At any rate, growth investors should keep an eye on e.l.f.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nLast on my list is PalantirTechnologies (NYSE: PLTR). Palantir is a big data analytics company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to examine immense data sets, recognize patterns, and deliver actionable insights.\n\nToday that's more important than ever, as organizations large and small find themselves awash in a sea of data. Palantir caters to both governmental and commercial organizations, helping them drive productivity, accuracy, and efficiency.\n\nFinancially, Palantir is clearly executing at a high level. Trailing-12 month revenue has soared from $1.2 billion in 2021 to $2.2 billion now. Similarly, free cash flow -- in many ways the ultimate measure of a company's ability to deliver shareholder returns -- has increased more than 10x, from $62 million in 2021 to $697 million today. PLTR Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nPLTR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n\nThanks to its impressive revenue and free cash flow growth and rising number of customers, Palantir is a stock worth considering for long-term, growth-oriented investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "content": "Investor\u2019s Business Daily\u2019sIBD 50 is \u201ca weekly, rules-based, computer-generated stock index.\u201d It \u201cseeks to identify the current top 50 growth stocks.\u201d Since the companies on the IBD Top 50 do tend to have strong fundamentals and excellent growth characteristics, it\u2019s a good screening tool that enables investors to find good stocks to buy. Moreover, not all of the names on the list are well-known firms. It\u2019s possible to find \u201chidden gems\u201d well-positioned to outperform the stock market on the IBD 50. For example, in the last year, I found two huge winners\u2014Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW)\u2014on the list. The following three stocks which are currently on the list are each extremely attractive for specific groups of investors.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) a blurry photo of people standing in line at an airport\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT) is an ttractive stock for investors looking for exposure to India, one of Earth\u2019s fastest-growing, best-positioned countries.\n\nIndeed, the country\u2019s economy is expected to grow an impressive 6% more than inflation last year. Economists anticipate it will repeat that feat in 2024. India is benefiting from positive demographic trends and the migration of many factories from China to India.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAnd MakeMyTrip, in turn, is clearly getting a lift from the rapid growth of the Indian economy. Last quarter, the online travel agency\u2019s revenue jumped 25.6% compared to $170.5 million a year earlier. In contrast, its operating profit, excluding some items, jumped to $33.4 million from $19.7 million during the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u201cDuring this seasonally strong quarter, we witnessed robust demand for leisure travel across all domestic and international destinations leading to the highest-ever quarterly gross bookings, revenue, and profit for the company,\u201d CEO Rajesh Magow reported.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), which markets cosmetics, is a great stock to buy for investors looking to benefit from American consumers\u2019 strength and the love millennials and Generation Z have for experiences. Many consumers use cosmetics when they enjoy experiences.\n\nStory continues\n\nE.L.F.\u2019s brand certainly resonates with a large portion of the market. Indeed, last quarter, its revenue soared 85% versus the same period a year earlier to $271 million, while its EBITDA, excluding certain items, jumped 61% year-over-year to $59.1 million.\n\nOn Feb. 5, investment bank Oppenheimeridentified ELF as its favorite name in the Consumer Staples space.\n\nInvestor\u2019s Business Daily gives ELF a very high Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, indicating that it\u2019s one of the more well-rounded names on the IBD Top 50.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a great pick for investors who want to benefit from the emerging Edge AI trend. As I noted in a previous column, \u201cEdge AI devices are connected to the internet and have their own AI rather than relying on distant data centers and the cloud.\u201d These devices provide users with major advantages over cloud-based AI. Specifically, they run more quickly, are more secure, and enable the use of many more applications.\n\nANET markets \u201chardware for localized data centers\u201d and \u201cinfrastructure software for managing local networks enabled by edge computing.\u201c As a result, it\u2019s well-positioned to benefit from the proliferation of Edge AI.\n\nMoreover, the firm\u2019s top and bottom lines are already expanding rapidly. Last quarter, its revenue advanced 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $1.5 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items, rose to $6.94 from $4.58 in Q4 of 2022.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in SMCI.

While the Magnificent 7 stocks can still generate positive returns over several years, some investors are setting their sights on the next group of leading stocks. Investors may want to consider some of these stocks when looking for equities that can become magnificent.\n\nThe Next Magnificent 7 Stocks: Adobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been a top performer in the stock market. Shares are up by 66% over the past year and have gained 141% over the past five years. The company\u2019s stock buyback program scooped up 11.5 million shares and elevated the stock price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe has invested in AI to boost retention rates and give customers more choices.\u00a0Adobe Firefly can quickly generate stunning template designs and vector graphics. You can write some text into the generative AI and receive AI-generated images based on the search query.\n\nAdobe\u2019s remaining performance obligations and annual recurring revenue suggest the equity can go higher. The creative software company has\u00a0over $15 billion in annual recurring revenue and achieved 12% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q4 FY23. Adobe also has $17.22 billion in remaining performance obligations compared to $19.41 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue.\n\nAdobe\u2019s net income expanded by 26.1% YOY.

The firm is also growing its number of customers with annual recurring revenue that exceeds $1 million. The firm closed fiscal 2022 with 317 of these customers.\n\nDatadog\u2019s November 2023 Investor Presentation indicates that most customers use multiple products within the Datadog ecosystem. More than 80% of customers are using at least two products while almost half of the company\u2019s customers use at least four products.\n\nDatadog is a volatile stock but has performed well over the years. Shares are up by 61% over the past year and have gained 268% over the past five years.\n\nThe Next Magnificent 7 Stocks: Elf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has been an under-the-radar beauty stock for several years. The equity has gained more than 1,750% over the past five years and is up by 141% over the past year.\n\nInvestors cheered on the stock\u2019s impressive earnings report which featured revenue acceleration and more market share within the industry.

The company is generating more sales than leadership had previously anticipated which is great for shareholders.\n\nElf Beauty currently trades at a 52-forward P/E ratio and offers double-digit net profit margins. The equity has the makings of a long-term winner, and the valuation is likely to smooth out for investors with multi-year time horizons.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nPalo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is a high-growth cybersecurity company that keeps many businesses safe from hackers. The rise of cyberattacks has increased the demand for Palo Alto Networks\u2019 solutions.\n\nThe company opened the\u00a0first quarter of fiscal 2024 with 20% YOY revenue growth. Net income surged by 871% YOY. Remaining performance obligations outpaced revenue growth and increased by 26% YOY. Rapid net income growth can strengthen the company\u2019s valuation which currently sits at 69-forward P/E ratio.\n\nIndustrial trends suggest Palo Alto Networks can continue its rally.\u00a0Ransomware attacks increased by 37% YOY and the average cost of ransomware payments is also going up. Thwarting cyber criminals before they infiltrate key data systems can save companies millions of dollars \u2013 and their reputations.\n\nPalo Alto Networks\u00a0posts data on its website that demonstrates the extent to which it protects businesses. The firm blocks approximately 329,640 malware executions per day and processes over 1 trillion IT processes.

Significant revenue and earnings growth have stirred optimism. Guidance suggests revenue will more than triple YOY.\n\nThe midpoint for the company\u2019s diluted EPS guidance came in at $5.215. This figure represents a 241% YOY growth rate. Rapid net income and revenue growth suggest a low forward P/E ratio. Shares currently trade at a 52 P/E ratio which isn\u2019t high for a company with Supermicro\u2019s financial growth and runway.\n\nCharles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro, offered encouraging remarks that demonstrate high retention and soaring demand. \u201cWhile we continue to win new partners, our current end customers continue to demand more of Supermicro\u2019s optimized AI computer platforms and rack-scale Total IT Solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nAttracting new customers while generating more money from your existing customers is a winning business model.\n\nCloudflare (NET) The logo of Cloudflare, (NET) an US web infrastructure & security company, its website on iOS.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) has built a vast platform with 13,000 networks that keep websites up and protect clients from cyberattacks. The company has over 189,000 paying customers who generate annual recurring revenue for the company. More than 60% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large customers. Q4 2023 featured a 35% YOY increase in that segment. The company closed the year with 2,756 large customers.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only highlight from the\u00a0fourth quarter of 2023. Cloudflare grew its revenue by 32% YOY while signing its largest new customer and its largest renewal contract. The company expects to generate $1.65 billion at the midpoint of its fiscal 2024 guidance. This midpoint suggests a 26.9% growth rate from the company\u2019s $1.30 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue.\n\nMatthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, cited \u201crobust momentum with large customers, significant progress in the public sector, and growth in Cloudflare One\u201d as catalysts for Q4 results. These tailwinds should help the stock march higher.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor firm that has outperformed the major indices. Shares are up by 112% over the past year and have gained 628% over the past five years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is emerging from the other side of macroeconomic headwinds and should return to high growth shortly. The company demonstrated progress by reporting 10% YOY\u00a0revenue growth in Q4 2023. That\u2019s much better than the company\u2019s 4% YOY revenue decline for all of 2023.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices achieved $667 million in GAAP net income in that quarter. The net profit margin exceeded 10% and can expand as the company\u2019s AI initiatives play out.\n\nAMD has a\u00a0vast portfolio of software and hardware solutions that make AI possible. It can help corporations use AI tools and generative AI to fuel more demand for their products. Artificial intelligence is in its early stages and has a large addressable market. AMD stands to benefit from AI tailwinds.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in ELF, SMCI, and NET.

        "content": "You can take a list of consumer stocks that can be the \u201cnext Procter & Gamble\u201d in many different ways. Certain small- and mid-cap stocks may share some of PG\u2019s attributes. They are products that foster brand loyalty, offer pricing power and perhaps even pay a dividend.\n\nBut these companies will have to deliver share price growth. Since 1984, that\u2019s something that Procter & Gamble has done at a non-split adjusted average of over 130% in the last 40 years.\n\nThat kind of consistency is the definition of \u201cwhen in doubt, zoom out.\u201d Also, it shows a stock\u2019s development of a reputation for letting investors sleep soundly, regardless of market fluctuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s still a tough task to find consumer stocks. But, among small- and mid-cap stocks showing healthy growth, three names stand out.\n\nWD40 (WDFC) a shelf stocked full of WD-40\n\nSource: Ismail Sadiron / Shutterstock.com\n\nWD40 (NYSE:WDFC) is part of the consumer staples sector since its products are always in demand.\n\nBut, the historical price chart for WDFC stock is up 2,432.39% since 1984. That averages out to a non-split adjusted 60% per year. WD40 delivered a 2-for-1 stock split in August 1997. Also, the company has a dividend that currently yields 1.35% and has been increasing for the last 15 years.\n\nIn October 2023, I placed WD40 on a list of overvalued stocks. Nothing has changed from a valuation standpoint. In fact, the company has a higher valuation based on its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. As of market close on February 13, 2024, WDFC checks in with a P/E ratio of 50.8x.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s average P/E over the last 10 years is around 37x. And many times in that span, the stock has traded at a P/E well above 40x.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to take a new position in WDFC stock. With short interest coming in around 13%, you may want to wait for a pullback. But if you currently own the stock, there\u2019s ample reason to believe that WD40 will continue to be one of the consumer stocks you shouldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nStory continues\n\nSkechers (SKX) sketchers show store. sleeper stocks\n\nSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkechers U.S.A. (NYSE:SKX) falls in the discretionary category of consumer stocks. The company has been publicly trading since 1999, and it shows some nice price action. The stock is averaging approximately 63% stock price growth per year.\n\nNotably, the company has made strides at upgrading its portfolio without losing its cache as a value brand to rivals such as Nike (NYSE:NKE). And, the company\u2019s footwear appeals to both affluent, aging Baby Boomers as well as Gen Z. That means the company isn\u2019t just a buy in a weak economy.\n\nAdditionally, Skechers checks the valuation box. At 17x forward earnings, the stock is currently trading below its historical average as well as the average of the broader consumer discretionary category.\n\nHowever, Skechers has some work to do in the dividend area before earning a title of \u201cnext Procter and Gamble.\u201d\u00a0Although no evidence exists that a dividend is coming, the company did undertake a $500 million share buyback in 2022.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last of the consumer stocks on my list of contenders for the next Procter & Gamble is e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF). The company fits into the consumer defensive category which I look at is either staples or discretionary depending on your point of view.\n\nInvestors buy stories, and e.l.f. Beauty has a strong one. The company is carving out a niche because its products are designed with vegan and cruelty-free ingredients. That resonates with its core demographic.\n\nIt\u2019s working. The company\u2019s revenue and earnings are up strongly year over year (YOY). At a time when many consumer stocks are having problems with growth, this is impressive. And, it shows up in the ELF stock price which is up 132% in the last year.\n\nThe stock has been trading publicly only since 2016, but it\u2019s already rewarding shareholders with an average gain of approximately 70% per year. And six weeks into 2024, the stock is impressively up 18%.\n\nInvestors pay a significant premium for the stock at 69x forward earnings. Plus, the early-stage growth company doesn\u2019t pay a dividend. Yet, with the company projecting 19.7% earnings growth in the next 12 months, this is one consumer stock to watch closely.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 beauty treatments that are expensive but totally worth it. If you are not interested in reading about the global beauty treatment market, head straight to the 5 Beauty Treatments That Are Expensive But Totally Worth It.\n\nIndulging in luxurious beauty treatments like lip fillers, massages, eye lash extensions, botox, and micro needling, among others can be a transformative experience, offering more than surface-level enhancements. From rejuvenating facials to lavish spa retreats, there exists a realm of beauty treatments that promise aesthetic improvements and holistic well-being. While some may come with a hefty price tag, their value in confidence, relaxation, and self-care transcends mere monetary considerations.\n\nLuxurious Beauty Splurges and Treatments Worth Every Penny\n\nThe global beauty and personal care market is a dynamic and growing industry with a wide range of products and services that cater to the desire for personal enhancement and wellness. The market encompasses skincare, fragrance, makeup, haircare, and various beauty treatments and is characterized by a mix of conventional and organic products.\n\nLuxury beauty treatments like micro needling, lash extensions, and botox represent a significant market segment, with consumers willing to invest in high-quality, premium offerings. The luxury and ultraluxury beauty market is expected to double from around $20 billion to $40 billion by 2027. This growth is driven by consumers' increasing desire for premiumization, especially in fragrance and makeup, and their willingness to pay for products that enhance their physical appearance and offer wellness benefits.\n\nFinancial statistics underline the robustness of this sector. The global beauty and personal care market size was estimated at USD 557.24 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.13% from 2023 to 2032, reaching a revenue share of $750.53 billion by 2032.\u00a0 The Asia Pacific region dominated the market with a share of 39% in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeauty treatments offer several benefits. Studies and market analysis suggest they can enhance physical appearance, boosting self-esteem and confidence. Moreover, the rise of wellness-inspired products indicates that consumers use beauty treatments to look and feel good, embracing more excellent self-care. Introducing cosmetics with natural, non-toxic, and organic ingredients caters to the rising consumer awareness about health, sustainability, and environmental impact. Additionally, the beauty market is characterized by continuous innovation, including using environmentally friendly packaging and developing new, sustainable beauty solutions.\n\nTransformative Trends in the US Beauty Treatment Market\n\nThe US beauty treatment market, a significant segment of the broader beauty and personal care industry, generated approximately $430 billion in revenue in 2022.

Mintel reports that 20% of men and 22% of women aged 18-34 have had a facial at a salon, and 25% of men aged 18-34 have had a manicure or pedicure, which indicates a growing interest among men in seeking beauty treatments traditionally associated with women.\n\nAdditionally, Mintel's survey found that nearly half of young men in the UK have indulged in spa, in-store, or beauty salon treatments in the past year. Among the most popular treatments for men are massages, facial hair removal or shaping, and body hair removal. This shift reflects changing attitudes towards male grooming and beauty, with men increasingly embracing self-care and grooming practices for their mental well-being and their overall health routine.\n\nThis trend towards gender inclusivity is evident in the beauty industry's move away from gender stereotypes. The industry is becoming more gender-neutral, making beauty treatments accessible and inclusive for people of all genders. This evolution reflects a broader cultural shift towards recognizing and celebrating diversity in beauty standards and practices.\n\nThe industry sees a premiumization trend, especially in fragrance and makeup, as consumers increasingly invest in higher-quality beauty products. Additionally, blending beauty and wellness has become prominent, with a demand for products promoting appearance and well-being.\n\nCommon beauty treatments in the US include skincare procedures, haircare services, makeup applications, fragrance products, and nail services. The market is driven by the aging population, skin disease prevalence, and a shift toward organic and chemical-free products, leading to increased personal care spending.\n\nDespite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the beauty treatment market has adapted, with online sales seeing a significant boost as consumers turn to e-commerce platforms for their beauty needs. In the United States alone, cosmetics & beauty e-commerce revenue reached an impressive $86 billion, highlighting the significant role of online platforms in the industry.

        "content": "In light of earnings from Coca-Cola (KO), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and others, Raymond James' Olivia Tong joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss trends in the consumer staples space.\n\nTong notes organic sales growth remains strong overall despite consumers staying value-focused. Companies with \"international exposure\" are seeing particular strength, like Colgate-Palmolive (CL) outpacing Proctor & Gamble (PG) despite P&G's \"strong gross margin.\"\n\nTong also identifies companies catering to both \"ends of the spectrum\" in terms of consumer budgets are performing well. She cites beauty brand E.L.F's (ELF) 85% sales surge thanks to shelf space gains, and value-conscious price points.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Consumer staples in focus this week as we see a number of companies report their quarterly results. Coca-Cola out this morning beating the Street's revenue expectations, showing consumers are still buying cans of Coke despite those higher prices. And we saw similar results in the last month from Colgate and Procter Gamble, both showing higher sales thanks to increased prices.\n\nOur next guest is tracking both of those companies. Olivia Tong, Raymond James' senior consumer staples analyst. Thank you for joining us this morning. So, what have we learned so far this earnings season about the state of the consumer and any sort of trade offs we're starting to see?\n\nOLIVIA TONG: Sure. Thanks again for having me. I think a couple of things to keep in mind. Organic sales is still very strong. You see very strong sales growth across consumer staples, across beauty, particularly in the US. The consumer has been pretty resilient.\n\nThey've stuck to their brands and they are looking for value, but continue to look for growth, both in terms of price and mix. Volume is starting to recover off of some pretty tough comps, but we continue to be quite bullish on the sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRAD SMITH: Where is the strongest element within this sector as of right now? As we're starting to-- and as Rochelle was mentioning, some of the reports that came through this morning really kind of giving us a sense of where these companies are continuing to push price through versus where they're just trying to make sure that they're maintaining market share.\n\nOLIVIA TONG: Sure. I think quite frankly, we like the multinationals or the domestics. We went into the year thinking that. And you're seeing that play out. Colgate grew faster than P&G this quarter. Coke over Pepsi.\n\nNow that said, the other area that we do like is companies that cater to either the tail end-- either tail end of the income spectrum versus in the middle. So you think about a company like e.l.f., for example, in beauty. Their average price points are in the $6 to $7 range.\n\nThey grew sales 85% in the quarter. So you're really seeing consumers look for value at both ends of the spectrum. Either if they're willing to pay a premium, they want some value add associated with that or a fairly low price point and, quite frankly, value associated with that as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Olivia, in terms of your top pick in staples and discretionary here, what are the standouts and why?\n\nOLIVIA TONG: Sure. We do like Colgate. We do like Procter. And we do like e.l.f., as I mentioned earlier. With respect to Colgate and Procter, we think that they will continue to grow faster than their peer set. Colgate, in particular, has a lot of international exposure, 80 plus percent international exposure.\n\nSo as you see disproportionate amount of pricing, Colgate will benefit from that. Whereas P&G, as sort of your steady Eddie, continue to grow price and mix. Very strong in terms of innovation and very strong gross margin and operating margin improvement.\n\nAnd quite frankly, the gross margin has been so strong that they've been able to spend a lot of that back in terms of advertising and other brand support. Within the beauty area, we really do like e.l.f. That continues to really resonate with us. We think there's a lot of white space opportunity there with respect to shelf space, international, different retailers as well.\n\nAnd they've been gaining shelf space and they continue to gain shelf space across a number of categories. So we are very bullish on e.l.f. and think that there continues to be a lot of opportunity there even with the tough comps.",

        "content": "The stock market gives investors many choices. There are thousands of corporations offering their shares in the public markets. Holding onto the right equities can lead to meaningful long-term returns.\n\nSome stocks are better than others and have the potential to become rising stars. This class of equities can outperform the market and reward long-term investors. If you are looking for some growth stock ideas, you may want to consider these companies.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSupermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) has enjoyed a bull run of the ages with a 132% year-to-date gain that has comfortably outperformed the major indices. The company\u2019s servers are built to handle the intense workload of artificial intelligence chips and are gaining momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSupermicro\u2019s rapid growth at the start of the year emerged due to the company\u2019s exceptional earnings and guidance. Net sales more than doubled year-over-year in the\u00a0second quarter of fiscal 2024. The midpoint of Supermicro\u2019s third-quarter guidance ($3.9 billion) suggests revenue will grow by over 200% year-over-year. Supermicro closed out Q3 FY23 with $1.3 billion in revenue.\n\nInclusion into the\u00a0S&P 500 seems inevitable at this point and will help the stock rally higher. Since the S&P 500 is a weighted index, Supermicro will become a larger percentage of the index as its market cap expands. Supermicro is generating all of this momentum without being in the index.\n\nInvestors may also want to note that a board member recently bought\u00a0$1 million worth of shares in the company. This purchase took place after the equity took off in 2024. Insiders are bullish, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Q4 2023 results demonstrated that the advertising market is accelerating. Revenue increased by 13% year-over-year while net income surged by 41% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence played a role in search engine and cloud revenue. Alphabet has been using AI to improve its products so businesses have more reasons to stick around. Cloud revenue was a standout with its 25.7% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nThe company\u2019s Other Bets segment also performed well but represents a minuscule segment of total revenue. While Other Bets is an unprofitable segment, Google Cloud recently became profitable and can expand margins in the future.\n\nAlphabet has two massive cash flow-producing segments that can fund other growth opportunities. The firm changed its name from Google to Alphabet to indicate the company wants to be more than just a search engine and a video platform. The corporation is strong already and looks poised to gain market share in multiple verticals.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nElf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a cosmetics brand that only uses ethical ingredients in its beauty products. The company has been a big hit among Gen Z and other age groups.\n\nShares have surged by over 1,750% over the past five years, and it looks like they can generate more gains for investors. The company\u2019s recent earnings report offered more reasons for optimism.\n\nElf Beauty reported an impressive 85% sales growth rate in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2024. That\u2019s a higher growth rate than the 78% year-over-year revenue growth posted in the previous quarter. The company gained an additional 305 basis points of market share.\n\nThis marks the company\u2019s 20th consecutive quarter of sales growth. Net income jumped from $19.1 million to $26.9 million which is a 40.8% year-over-year increase.\n\nElf Beauty raised guidance considerably for fiscal 2024. The midpoint in fiscal 2024 revenue guidance was previously $901 million. The midpoint has been moved to $985 million which indicates strong growth in the upcoming quarter.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the largest publicly traded company by market cap. If you invest in a fund that mirrors the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100, you already have exposure to this equity.\n\nMicrosoft has gained 55% over the past year and is up by 292% over the past five years. Double-digit growth rates in enticing verticals helped the tech conglomerate reach a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings results for\u00a0Q2 FY24 highlight why it\u2019s been a top stock. Revenue increased by 18% year-over-year while net income jumped by 33% year-over-year. Microsoft\u2019s completed Activision Blizzard acquisition and further successes with artificial intelligence contributed to the financial results.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was a standout and was up by 24% year-over-year. Cloud is a meaningful revenue driver for the company that can remain high for many years to come. The firm hasn\u2019t shied away from making big investments and can use its capital to acquire additional companies.\n\nCloudflare (NET) In this photo illustration a Cloudflare Inc (NET) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloudflare (NYSE:NET) keeps many websites up and running. The content delivery network firm also has several cybersecurity features designed to keep its clients safe from attacks.\n\nCloudflare has a good reputation for outperforming the market. Shares are up by 87% over the past year and have gained 506% over the past five years.\n\nThe company\u2019s\u00a0fourth-quarter results drew plenty of excitement and resulted in a 20% gain in the stock price. During that quarter, Cloudflare grew revenue by 32% year-over-year. The firm also achieved record operating cash flow and record free cash flow.\n\nCloudflare is experiencing more demand for its services and broke a new record for the annual contract value for one of its customers. The company didn\u2019t stop at signing its largest new customer. Cloudflare also sealed the deal on its largest customer renewal ever. Customers are turning to Cloudflare in an uncertain economy to stay safe from hackers and keep their systems up and running.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) delivered a record-breaking third quarter that exceeded expectations. Annual recurring revenue now exceeds $3 billion and the firm grew its revenue by 35% year-over-year.\n\nThe company\u2019s artificial intelligence initiatives have given customers more choices and better results. George Kurtz, Crowdstrike\u2019s president, co-founder, and CEO, shared promising news about those efforts in the press release.\n\n\u201cCustomers increasingly trust the AI-native Falcon XDR platform as their cybersecurity consolidator of choice,\u201d Kurtz stated.\n\nThe company is also sitting on $3.17 billion in cash which it can use to make acquisitions. While stock buybacks should be ruled out for now since the company is still expanding, investors can feel more confident knowing Crowdstrike has a large cash position and is generating profits.\n\nThe equity has rewarded long-term investors so far. CRWD stock is up by 202% over the past year and has a 5-year gain of 413%. Crowdstrike is one of the top cybersecurity firms and offers exposure to a rapidly growing industry.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a top-performing semiconductor stock that recently surpassed a $600 billion market cap. The equity\u2019s 1-year and 5-year gains stand at 116% and 355% respectively.\n\nThe company has benefitted from semiconductor tailwinds for many years, but artificial intelligence has propped the stock higher in recent months. Broadcom\u2019s Trident 5-X12 is the answer for companies that want effective AI chips.\n\nThe cutting-edge chip contributed to Broadcom\u2019s 5% year-over-year revenue growth in the\u00a0third quarter of fiscal 2023. Broadcom initiated $2.17 billion in stock buybacks and accumulated 2.9 million shares.\n\nBroadcom continues to give out dividends to investors and recently\u00a0hiked its quarterly dividend from $4.60 per share to $5.25 per share. That\u2019s a 14.1% growth rate.\n\nBroadcom also has a vast software business segment that became stronger from its VMware acquisition.

        "content": "Beauty and personal care companies carved out a space at Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF), L'Or\u00e9al-owned (LRLCY) NYX Cosmetics and CeraVe, and Unilever\u2019s (UL) Dove presented new ads during football's biggest night, highlighting that Super Bowl commercials aren\u2019t just the domain of car and beer brands.\n\nBeauty companies' willingness to shell out for prime-time commercials comes as the industry continues to post impressive growth since the pandemic, propped up by resilient consumer spending and trends on social media.\n\nAfter a successful regional Super Bowl ad featuring actress Jennifer Coolidge in 2023, e.l.f. doubled down with a national ad spot. The affordable cosmetics company has ramped up advertising spending in recent years, and its investment in marketing reached 26% of net sales in its most recent quarter compared to 17% a year ago.\n\n\"The overwhelming success of the campaign by every metric fueled our return with a national presence this year versus a regional spot the year prior,\" e.l.f. Beauty CEO Tarang Amin said on the company's Feb. 6 earnings call. \"Securing a national spot increases our household impressions by a factor of 3x. We believe this reach provides the best opportunity to springboard [a] viral moment across a wide spectrum of platforms and increases our ability to boost brand impact.\"\n\nMarketers pay a premium for the exposure the Super Bowl offers. The cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has grown to between $6 million and $7 million, making it one of the most expensive advertising opportunities globally, according to Stacy Jones, founder of Hollywood Branded.\n\nLast year, the game drew a record 115 million viewers. And this year, some anticipated that Taylor Swift would boost ratings for Sunday\u2019s game, particularly among women. In the first three weeks of \"Sunday Night Football,\" NFL viewership spiked 53% among teen girls, 24% among women ages 18-24, and 34% among women over the age of 35, Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reported.\n\nStory continues\n\ne.l.f., NYX, and CeraVe push for brand awareness\n\nE.l.f. Beauty aimed to duplicate last year's success by running its first national Super Bowl ad campaign.\n\nThe celebrity-heavy commercial featured Judge Judy Sheindlin, as \"Judge Beauty,\" as well as \"Suits\" actors Gina Torres and Sarah Rafferty, singer Meghan Trainor, and former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho to highlight the brand\u2019s $14 Halo Glow Liquid Filter complexion booster.\n\nAccording to Amin, the commercial gained 11 billion impressions as of Feb. 6, five days before it aired during the Super Bowl. Last year, e.l.f.\u2019s Super Bowl commercial amassed 57 billion impressions and drove 10 times the usual traffic to its website in the two minutes after the ad aired, e.l.f. CFO Mandy Fields told Fortune. Judy Sheindlin stars as \"Judge Beauty\" in e.l.f. Beauty's Super Bowl commercial. (Screenshot)\n\nIt's a formula that seems to be working. In its fiscal third quarter, e.l.f. reported that sales grew 85% on an annual basis to $270.9 million, its 20th consecutive quarter of net sales growth, and raised its guidance for marketing and digital investment.\n\n\"We feel great about the 24% [marketing spend] that we're guiding this year, and that's really based on the tremendous [returns on investment] we're seeing on our marketing investment in terms of gross sales per dollar invested,\" Amin said. \"I've been in the consumer space for over 30 years. It's the first brand I've seen where you take up your marketing levels and actually get better ROIs. So, we feel really good about what we continue to see from a marketing ROI standpoint even as we take our levels up.\"\n\nIn 2022, e.l.f. Beauty spent more than $96 million on advertising. While it aims to increase brand awareness, it's competing against the largest name in beauty, L'Or\u00e9al, which spent 12 billion euros across all its brands that same year.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also has hiked its ad spending: Its advertising and promotional expenses increased by 90 basis points year over year to 32.4% of sales, according to the French conglomerate's 2023 annual report.\n\nHoping to enjoy the same success as the previous Super Bowl campaigns of e.l.f. Beauty and Rihanna's Fenty Beauty (which coincided with Rihanna's halftime show) in 2023, L'Or\u00e9al debuted two ads for NYX Cosmetics and skin care brand CeraVe. Affordable cosmetics brand NYX tapped Cardi B in its Super Bowl feature. (YouTube screenshot)\n\nNYX's 30-second ad promoted its \"Duck Plump\" lip gloss with rapper Cardi B debuting in the brand's first celebrity partnership. The commercial \"aims to flip the script on male stereotypes with a humorous look at the extreme plumping sensation of the gloss, which will leave audiences laughing,\" NYX Cosmetics said in a press release.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also aired a Super Bowl commercial for its skin care brand CeraVe, starring actor Michael Cera, as part of a weekslong marketing push.\n\n\"The Super Bowl presented an ideal stage to illuminate our brand's mission through an innovative approach \u2014 a first of its kind immersive campaign, inviting everyone to participate in a memorable prank-like experience,\" said Melanie Vidal, CeraVe's global brand general manager.\n\n\u201cFor a brand that\u2019s not a famous brand, \u2026 I think it did the job because Michael Cera, CeraVe, it\u2019s very clear what the brand is, and you remember it,\u201d Mekanism CEO Jason Harris told Yahoo Finance Live. \u201cOne celebrity. One joke playing off the name. It landed. While it may not be the riskiest ad ever, \u2026 it does the job, and it\u2019s worth the $7 million to pay for media because now the brand is well known, and you\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d Actor Michael Cera promotes CeraVe moisturizing cream in a new commercial. (YouTube screenshot)\n\nCeraVe wasn't the only skin care company to promote its products. Cetaphil, which is owned by Galderma, nodded to the \"Taylor Swift effect\" in a new heartwarming commercial.\n\nMeanwhile, Dove\u2019s ad \u2014 titled \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" \u2014 promoted young girls in sport and body confidence. In the lead-up to the big game, the Unilever subsidiary counted on Kylie Kelce to help promote the brand.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, shares of e.l.f. are up 21%, while Unilever stock has risen 4% and L'Or\u00e9al shares have seen a 7% decline.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Growth Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "As this bull market heats up, frothy valuations are beginning to show up. Some companies are garnering unwarranted attention by just mentioning AI in their earnings call. Avoid getting caught up in the hype by considering undervalued growth stocks showing impressive results today.\n\nIdentifying undervalued growth stocks means searching for companies with strong potential for future growth that are currently priced affordably. Historical growth and the total addressable market are good indicators of growth possibilities. Moreover, these picks must be profitable and trade at reasonable forward price-to-earnings ratios.\n\nThe following companies are showing robust growth, achieving over 15% quarter-over-quarter sales growth in their most recent earnings. What\u2019s more, their end markets are in healthy shape and have shown growing demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith strong growth prospects and cheap multiples, these are top picks as undervalued growth stocks. According to Finviz data, the following three stocks are projected to grow EPS by 30% annually over the next five years. Let\u2019s explore why these companies could be considered solid picks for investors seeking growth at a reasonable price.\n\nVertiv Holdings (VRT) a photo of a city with a digital grid overhead, showing the wide range of connectivity that comes with 5G. communications stocks\n\nVertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) specializes in designing, manufacturing, and servicing critical digital infrastructure technologies, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments. Particularly, the company has attractive growth prospects in its life cycle services and cooling systems for data centers.\n\nGiven the exponential growth in data consumption, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, the demand for dependable and efficient data center infrastructure is soaring. Admittedly, AI data centers are more power-intensive, requiring 60 or more kilowatts per rack compared to traditional ones that require five to 10 kilowatts per rack.\n\nThis increased power usage fits Vertiv, which serves those end markets. Its cooling systems, power supplies, and services are critical for operating data centers worldwide. In Q3 FY2023, the company achieved 17% year-over-year organic growth in net sales, with a notable 11% increase in orders.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith management expecting 21% organic growth for FY2023, Vertiv stands out as an undervalued growth stock. Trading at 26 times forward earnings, it\u2019s bargain for a company expected to grow EPS by over 200% this year.\n\nVertiv\u2019s products, such as chillers, heat rejection systems, switchgear, cooling systems, busbars and UPS, are seeing tremendous demand from data center buildouts. The company is positioned as a one-stop solution for all power and cooling needs for the data center and will continue to win.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nFollowing impressive earnings on Feb. 6, e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) remains one of the most undervalued growth stocks. This cosmetics company is known for its affordable, high-quality beauty products. It sells its products through online channels and major retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\ne.l.f. Beauty has carved out a niche in the competitive beauty industry by offering vegan and cruelty-free products. This approach appears to be resonating with ethically minded consumers, which is why the company delivered a beat and raise quarter.\n\nThe just released third quarter fiscal 2024 results were impressive. Net sales were $270.9 million, representing 85% year-over-year growth compared to 49% in Q3 FY2023. This acceleration clearly indicates soaring demand and yet another quarter of market share gains.\n\nThe 305 basis points gained in market share marked the 20th consecutive quarter of gains, and based on management\u2019s upbeat guidance, they expect this trend to continue. For FY2024, revenue expectations have been raised from $896-906 million to $980-990 million.\n\nThe growing consumer preference for ethical beauty products will buoy ELF stock. Furthermore, the beauty industry\u2019s resilience to economic downturns is another positive. Finally, as e.l.f. Beauty expands into new categories, revenues will continue to soar.\n\nNextracker (NXT) Solar panels on rooftops in California, an increasingly common sight, solar stocks\n\nSource: Simone Hogan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) provides solar tracker solutions, essential components in solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Its systems and software help optimize the orientation of solar panels to the sun, enhancing their energy output.\n\nWith the global push towards renewable energy, the demand for solar energy solutions, including tracking systems, is expected to grow substantially. According to Mordor Intelligence, the solar tracker market will grow at a 22.38% compounded annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029. Nextracker\u2019s leadership, coupled with its strong pipeline of global projects, positions it well to capitalize on this growth.\n\nQ3 FY2024 results were another demonstration of the ongoing momentum, with revenue surging 38% YOY to $710 million. Adjusted EBITDA was more impressive at $168 million, a 168% YOY growth.

JPMorgan Chase increased the price target from $61 to $73. Truist Securities and Piper Sandler also increased their targets to $70 and $63, respectively.

        "content": "A company's growth can tell investors a lot. Companies that grow their revenue at high rates over a long period of time typically deliver superior returns to the broad market.\n\nAnd this kind of robust revenue growth has sent the stocks of energy drink maker Celsius Holdings(NASDAQ: CELH) and emerging cosmetics brand e.l.f. Beauty(NYSE: ELF) up 80% and 140%, respectively, over the last year. Here's what's fueling these companies' momentum and why I wouldn't hesitate to buy shares right now.\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nEmerging beverage brand Celsius has used a lucrative distribution agreement with PepsiCo to gain market share in the $159 billion energy drink market. The strong demand for its products is fueling the same level of rapid expansion that sent Monster Beverage stock up over 50,000% in the last 20 years.\n\nCelsius started as a pre-workout dietary supplement over 10 years ago, but it's now expanding its presence across retail stores thanks to PepsiCo. The two companies struck an agreement in 2022 that allows PepsiCo to be the company's primary distribution supplier, and Celsius is set to begin expanding internationally in Canada this quarter, which could open the floodgates for additional growth.\n\nCelsius is distinguishing itself from industry leaders like Monster Energy and Red Bull with its focus on \"better-for-you\" marketing. It makes drinks to assist with weight loss and features no sugar or artificial ingredients. That approach has resonated with consumers as its revenue surged 104% year over year through the first nine months of 2023.\n\nManagement sees significant potential for the brand over the next five years, which justifies the stock's high forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 55. The company's market-share gains in a massive energy drink market should send the stock to new highs over the next few years and beyond.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty\n\nAnother fast-growing consumer brand is e.l.f. Beauty. It's an emerging leader in a $600 billion personal care and beauty market. E.l.f. stock climbed 140% over the last 12 months as it hits new all-time highs thanks to its latest business update.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing three consecutive quarters of at least 75% revenue growth last year, the company's revenue rose 85% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31). During the period, e.l.f. also acquired skincare brand Naturium for $333 million, which extends the company's growth opportunity.\n\nThe acquisition of Naturium is part of management's plan to leverage its brand momentum in skincare, where e.l.f. is already growing about 10 times faster than competitors.\n\nIn cosmetics, e.l.f. continues to win big through its partnership with Target, where its value-priced products are outselling established cosmetics brands. Management is focused on replicating the Target strategy with other retailers.\n\nThe stock's forward P/E of 59 is expensive, but the company's impressive trajectory makes a strong case for the stock. Analysts have been raising their growth estimates and now expect earnings to grow over 30% annually over the next three to five years. Even with the stock reaching new highs, there's enough fuel in the tank for e.l.f to deliver market-beating returns.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Celsius wasn\u2019t one of them.
